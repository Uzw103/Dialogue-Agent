Homology has been proposed between glomus cells, which are neural crest-derived, and the hypoxia-sensitive \u2018neuroepithelial cells\u2019 ( NECs ) of fish gills, whose embryonic origin is unknown. NECs have also been likened to PNECs, which differentiate in situ within lung airway epithelia. Using genetic lineage-tracing and neural crest-deficient mutants in zebrafish, and physical fate-mapping in frog and lamprey, we find that NECs are not neural crest-derived, but endoderm-derived, like PNECs, whose endodermal origin we confirm. We discover neural crest-derived catecholaminergic cells associated with zebrafish pharyngeal arch blood vessels, and propose a new model for amniote hypoxia-sensitive cell evolution: endoderm-derived NECs were retained as PNECs, while the carotid body evolved via the aggregation of neural crest-derived catecholaminergic ( chromaffin ) cells already associated with blood vessels in anamniote pharyngeal arches.  During hypoxia in vertebrates, respiratory reflexes such as hyperventilation are triggered by neurotransmitter release from hypoxia-sensitive serotonergic cells associated with pharyngeal arch arteries, as well as in the lungs and/or gills ( reviewed by\u00a0L\u00f3pez-Barneo et al., 2016; Cutz et al., 2013; Jonz et al., 2016 ). In amniotes, these are the \u2018glomus cells\u2019 of the carotid body, located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery ( reviewed by Nurse, 2014; L\u00f3pez-Barneo et al., 2016 ), and the \u2018pulmonary neuroendocrine cells\u2019 ( PNECs ) of lung airway epithelia, found either as solitary, flask-shaped cells, or collected into \u2018neuroepithelial bodies\u2019 ( NEBs ), preferentially located at airway branch points ( reviewed by Cutz et al., 2013 ). Glomus cells respond to hypoxia in arterial blood by releasing stored neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, ATP, the catecholamine dopamine, and serotonin ( the latter two most likely acting as autocrine/paracrine neuromodulators ) ( reviewed by Nurse and Piskuric, 2013; Nurse, 2014 ). These excite afferent terminals of the carotid sinus nerve ( a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve, arising from neurons in the petrosal ganglion ) in mammals ( reviewed by Nurse and Piskuric, 2013; Nurse, 2014 ), and of the vagal nerve ( arising from neurons in the nodose ganglion ) in birds ( Kameda, 2002 ). The afferent nerves relay signals to the nucleus of the solitary tract within the hindbrain, to elicit respiratory reflex responses such as hyperventilation ( reviewed by Teppema and Dahan, 2010 ). PNECs respond to hypoxia by releasing stored serotonin and various neuropeptides onto vagal afferents, and are thought to act as hypoxia-sensitive airway sensors ( reviewed by Cutz et al., 2013; also see Branchfield et al., 2016 ). PNECs also provide an important stem-cell niche for regenerating the airway epithelium after injury ( Reynolds et al., 2000; Guha et al., 2012; Song et al., 2012 ) and were recently shown to be the predominant cells of origin for small cell lung cancer ( Park et al., 2011; Sutherland et al., 2011; Song et al., 2012 ). The evolution of glomus cells was critical for the transition from aquatic life, where externally\u00a0facing hypoxia-sensors are essential for monitoring the variable oxygen levels in water, to fully terrestrial life, where reflex responses to variations in internal oxygen levels are more important, given the stability of oxygen levels in air ( Burleson and Milsom, 2003; Milsom and Burleson, 2007 ). However, the evolutionary history of glomus cells - and, indeed, PNECs - is uncertain. One commonly suggested hypothesis ( e. g., Milsom and Burleson, 2007; Hempleman and Warburton, 2013; Jonz et al., 2016 ) is that glomus cells are homologous to the chemosensory \u2018neuroepithelial cells\u2019 ( NECs ) of fish gills. These were originally identified within the primary epithelium of the gills in various teleosts and a shark, as innervated cells ( isolated or clustered ) containing dense-cored vesicles; formaldehyde-induced fluorescence revealed the presence of biogenic amines, identified as serotonin, while electron microscopy following exposure of trout to acute hypoxia revealed fewer vesicles, which appeared degranulated ( Dunel-Erb et al., 1982 ). In vitro patch-clamp studies on NECs isolated from zebrafish and catfish gills ( identified by neutral red, a vital dye that stains monoamine-containing cells including serotonergic PNECs; Youngson et al., 1993 ), confirmed that teleost gill NECs are hypoxia-sensitive ( Jonz et al., 2004; Burleson et al., 2006 ). The conventional marker for teleost gill NECs is serotonin: although non-serotonergic gill NECs were identified in adult zebrafish by immunoreactivity for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2, these may represent immature NECs ( Jonz and Nurse, 2003; Jonz et al., 2004 ). NECs are found near efferent gill arteries and on the basal lamina of the gill epithelia, facing the flow of water, hence can detect hypoxia and other stimuli in either blood or external water ( reviewed by Jonz et al., 2016 ). Like glomus cells ( reviewed by Nurse, 2014; L\u00f3pez-Barneo et al., 2016 ), zebrafish gill NECs also respond to acid hypercapnia ( increased CO2/H+ ) ( L\u00f3pez-Barneo et al., 1988; Buckler, 1997; Jonz et al., 2004; Qin et al., 2010 ). The putative shared evolutionary ancestry of glomus cells and gill NECs ( e. g. Milsom and Burleson, 2007; Hempleman and Warburton, 2013; Jonz et al., 2016 ) is supported by many similarities: both are associated with pharyngeal arch arteries ( the carotid body develops in association with the third pharyngeal arch artery, which will form the carotid artery ), provided with afferent innervation by glossopharyngeal and/or vagal nerves, and have background ( 'leak' ) K+ currents that are inhibited by hypoxia, resulting in membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and neurotransmitter release ( L\u00f3pez-Barneo et al., 1988; Buckler, 1997; Jonz et al., 2004; Qin et al., 2010 ). If glomus cells and gill NECs evolved from the same ancestral cell population, they should share a common embryonic origin. Glomus cells are neural crest-derived, as demonstrated in birds by quail-chick neural fold grafts ( Le Douarin et al., 1972; Pearse et al., 1973 ), and in mouse by Wnt1-Cre genetic lineage-tracing ( Pardal et al., 2007 ), but the embryonic origin of NECs is unknown. Lack of immunoreactivity for the HNK1 antibody, which labels migrating neural crest cells in many but not all vertebrates, has been reported for NECs ( Porteus et al., 2013, 2014 ). However, the carbohydrate epitope recognized by the HNK1 antibody ( Voshol et al., 1996 ) is borne by multiple glycoproteins and glycolipids, and gene or antigen expression in itself cannot indicate lineage. An alternative to the hypothesis that gill NECs and glomus cells evolved from a common ancestral cell population is that NECs share ancestry with PNECs, to which they were originally likened ( Dunel-Erb et al., 1982 ). Hypoxia-sensing by PNECs, as in NECs and glomus cells, involves inhibition of a K+ current by hypoxia ( reviewed by Cutz et al., 2013; Nurse, 2014; L\u00f3pez-Barneo et al., 2016; Jonz et al., 2016 ). In contrast to the neural crest origin of glomus cells ( Le Douarin et al., 1972; Pearse et al., 1973; Pardal et al., 2007 ), PNECs have an intrinsic pulmonary epithelial origin: the first experimental support for this was provided by a tritiated thymidine labeling study of hamster lung development ( Hoyt et al., 1990 ), later confirmed by mouse genetic lineage-tracing studies using Id2-CreERT2, Shh-Cre, Nkx2. 1-Cre, and Sox9-Cre driver lines that showed a common origin for all lung airway epithelial cell types, including PNECs ( Rawlins et al., 2009; Song et al., 2012; Kuo and Krasnow, 2015 ). Here, we demonstrate that neural crest cells do not contribute to gill NECs: instead, these are endoderm-derived. This refutes the hypothesis that glomus cells and gill NECs evolved from a common ancestral cell population, and instead supports an evolutionary relationship between NECs and PNECs, whose endodermal origin we confirm in mouse. We also show that the transcription factor Phox2b, which is required for glomus cell development ( Dauger et al., 2003 ), is not expressed by gill NECs ( or by PNECs ), arguing against the possibility of cell-type homology between glomus cells and gill NECs via activation of the same genetic network. Finally, we report the discovery of neural crest-derived chromaffin ( catecholaminergic ) cells associated with blood vessels in the pharyngeal arches of juvenile zebrafish, which we speculate could share an evolutionary ancestry with glomus cells. Given these results, we propose a new model for the evolution of hypoxia-sensitive cells during the transition to terrestrial life.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The carotid bodies are small glands found in either side of our neck, near the carotid artery. When the level of oxygen in our blood drops, specialized cells in the carotid bodies signal to the brain to increase our heart rate and make us breathe more rapidly and deeply. As a result, more oxygen is delivered to our cells. Fish have similar oxygen-sensitive cells in their gills, known as neuroepithelial cells, that detect changes in the oxygen levels in the surrounding water and their blood. It has been suggested that after our vertebrate ( back-boned animal ) ancestors moved onto land, the neuroepithelial cells in their gills eventually evolved to form the carotid bodies. Knowing whether this is true would allow researchers to better understand how our ancestors were able to adapt to an obligate air-breathing lifestyle on land. If the carotid body did evolve from ancestral neuroepithelial cells, we would expect that they would both develop from the same kind of cells in the embryo. Carotid body cells develop from a group of cells called neural crest cells, which give rise to many tissues, including nerve cells. Hockman et al. have now investigated whether neuroepithelial cells also develop from neural crest cells. Hockman et al. labelled the neural crest cells in the embryos of zebrafish, frogs and lampreys using techniques such as injecting the cells with fluorescent dye or genetically modifying the cells to make fluorescent proteins. Unexpectedly, the neuroepithelial cells that developed in the gills of these embryos did not contain these fluorescent labels, meaning that they did not develop from the neural crest cells. The patterns of gene activity found in the developing neuroepithelial cells were also different from those in the carotid body. Further investigation revealed that neuroepithelial cells develop from the lining of the mouth and gills and may be related to a similar population of oxygen-sensitive cells found in the lungs. Overall, it appears that the carotid body did not evolve from ancestral neuroepithelial cells. However, Hockman et al. did find some cells near blood vessels in the gills of zebrafish that had developed from neural crest cells. Equivalent cells in our ancestors could therefore be the cells that evolved into carotid bodies. A first test of this theory will be to determine whether or not these cells are oxygen-sensitive ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nLipid droplets are lipid storage organelles found in nearly all cell types from adipocytes to cancer cells. Although increasingly implicated in disease, current methods to study lipid droplets in vertebrate models rely on static imaging or the use of fluorescent dyes, limiting investigation of their rapid in vivo dynamics. To address this, we created a lipid droplet transgenic reporter in whole animals and cell culture by fusing tdTOMATO to Perilipin-2 ( PLIN2 ), a lipid droplet structural protein. Expression of this transgene in transparent casper zebrafish enabled in vivo imaging of adipose depots responsive to nutrient deprivation and high-fat diet. Simultaneously, we performed a large-scale in vitro chemical screen of 1280 compounds and identified several novel regulators of lipolysis in adipocytes. Using our Tg ( -3. 5ubb:plin2-tdTomato ) zebrafish line, we validated several of these novel regulators and revealed an unexpected role for nitric oxide in modulating adipocyte lipid droplets. Similarly, we expressed the PLIN2-tdTOMATO transgene in melanoma cells and found that the nitric oxide pathway also regulated lipid droplets in cancer. This model offers a tractable imaging platform to study lipid droplets across cell types and disease contexts using chemical, dietary, or genetic perturbations.  Lipid droplets are cellular organelles that act as storage sites for neutral lipids and are key regulators of cellular metabolism ( Wilfling et al., 2013 ). Lipid droplets are present in most cell types and are characterized by a monophospholipid membrane surrounding a hydrophobic lipid core ( Tauchi-Sato et al., 2002; Wilfling et al., 2013 ). Cells maintain energetic homeostasis and membrane formation through the regulated incorporation and release of fatty acids and lipid species from the lipid droplet core ( Kurat et al., 2009; Kuerschner et al., 2008; Fujimoto et al., 2007; Zimmermann et al., 2004 ). Importantly, lipid droplets can assume various functions during cellular stress through the sequestration of potentially toxic lipids and misfolded proteins ( Bailey et al., 2015; Listenberger et al., 2003; Vevea et al., 2015; Fei et al., 2009 ), maintenance of energy and redox homeostasis ( Liu et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017 ), regulation of fatty acid transfer to the mitochondria for \u03b2-oxidation ( Rambold et al., 2015; Herms et al., 2015 ), and the maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane homeostasis ( Chitraju et al., 2017; Bosma et al., 2014; Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2016; Vevea et al., 2015 ). Moreover, a\u00a0recent study demonstrated that lipid droplets actively participate in the innate immune response ( Bosch et al., 2020 ) and, conversely, can be hijacked by infectious agents like hepatitis C virus to facilitate viral replication ( Barba et al., 1997; Miyanari et al., 2007; Vieyres et al., 2020 ). The role of lipid droplets in metabolic homeostasis and cellular stress is critical across multiple cell types and has also been increasingly implicated in cancer. For example, lipid droplets can act as a storage pool in cancer cells after they take up lipids from extracellular sources, including adipocytes ( Kuniyoshi et al., 2019; Nieman et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Lipid droplets are ubiquitous across most cell types; however, they are essential to the function of adipocytes in regulating organismal energy homeostasis ( Zimmermann et al., 2004; Bergman et al., 2001 ). White adipocytes, which contain a large unilocular lipid droplet, can be readily labeled by lipophilic dyes ( Minchin and Rawls, 2017a; Fam et al., 2018 ). However, in vivo imaging of lipid droplets, in adipocytes or other cell types, is currently highly limited. Understanding the dynamics of lipid droplets in vivo, rather than in fixed tissues, is important since the size of the lipid droplet can change very rapidly in response to fluctuating metabolic needs ( Bosch et al., 2020; Fam et al., 2018 ). In mice, much of adipose tissue imaging utilizes tissue fixation and sectioning, which can fail to preserve key aspects of the tissue structure ( Berry et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2010 ). Whole-mount imaging approaches in mice can be combined with adipocyte-specific promoters; however, these methods still require tissue dissection and can be limited by tissue thickness ( Berry and Rodeheffer, 2013; Chi et al., 2018 ). Zebrafish offer a tractable model to address these limitations given the ease of high-throughput imaging of live animals. This is especially true with the availability of relatively transparent strains such as casper, which allows for detailed in vivo imaging without the need for fixation of the animal ( White et al., 2008 ). Although less well studied than other vertebrates, zebrafish adipose tissue is highly similar to mammalian white adipose tissue, and a\u00a0detailed work has classified the timing, dynamics, and location of zebrafish adipose tissue development ( Minchin and Rawls, 2017a ). Current imaging approaches using lipophilic fluorescent dyes or analogs in vivo have advanced our understanding of lipid droplets in adipocytes and other cell types ( Minchin and Rawls, 2017a; Minchin et al., 2018; Minchin and Rawls, 2017b; Carten et al., 2011; Farber et al., 2001; Otis and Farber, 2016 ) ; however, these methods can require extensive and repeated staining, which may restrict the ability to read out dynamic changes over time. Furthermore, fluorescent dyes such as BODIPY and NileRed have limitations in their specificity for the lipid droplet ( Daemen et al., 2016 ). Finally, although a probe-free imaging approach to study subcellular lipid populations has been recently described ( H\u00f8gset et al., 2020 ), this method is restricted to early-stage zebrafish, which would fail to capture post-embryonic cell populations and tissues, including adipocytes. Here, we report the development of an in vivo lipid droplet reporter using a -3. 5ubb:plin2-tdTomato transgene in the casper strain. To date, transgenic lipid droplet reporters have been restricted to cell culture systems and invertebrate model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) and Drosophila ( Targett-Adams et al., 2003; Beller et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015 ) although a similar approach in zebrafish was recently described while this manuscript was in review ( Wilson et al., 2021 ). We demonstrate that the -3. 5ubb:plin2-tdTomato reporter faithfully marks the lipid droplet, which enables robust in vivo imaging. We show that this reporter can be applied to visualize adipocytes and to monitor adipose tissue remodeling in response to dietary and pharmacologic perturbations. Furthermore, we report the discovery of novel pharmacologic regulators of adipocyte lipolysis such as nitric oxide and demonstrate that several of these compounds can modulate adipose tissue area in our in vivo system. To facilitate the study of lipid droplets in novel contexts outside of adipocytes, we also generated a zebrafish melanoma cell line ( ZMEL ) ( Heilmann et al., 2015 ) expressing -3. 5ubb:plin2-tdTomato ( ZMEL-LD ). We confirm that this cell line can be used to monitor changes in lipid droplet production in response to both known and novel regulators of lipolysis. We anticipate that these models will be highly valuable as a high-throughput imaging platform to investigate lipid droplets in both adipose tissue biology and disease contexts such as cancer.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Organisms need fat molecules as a source of energy and as building blocks, but these \u2018lipids\u2019 can also damage cells if they are present in large amounts. Cells guard against such toxicity by safely sequestering lipids in specialized droplets that participate in a range of biological processes. For instance, these structures can quickly change size to store or release lipids depending on the energy demands of a cell. It is possible to image lipid droplets \u2013 using, for example, dyes that preferentially stain fat \u2013 but often these methods can only yield a snapshot: tracking lipid droplet dynamics over time remains difficult. Lumaquin, Johns et al. therefore set out to develop a new method that could label lipid droplets and monitor their behaviour \u2018live\u2019 in the cells of small, transparent zebrafish larvae. First, the fish were genetically manipulated so that a key protein found in lipid droplets would carry a fluorescent tag: this made the structures strongly fluorescent and easy to track over time. And indeed, Lumaquin, Johns et al. could monitor changes in the droplets depending on the fish diet, with the structures getting bigger when the animal received rich food, and shrinking when resources were scarce. Finally, experiments were conducted to screen for compounds that could lead to lipids being released in fat cells. The new imaging technique was then used to confirm the effect of these molecules in live cells, revealing an unexpected role for a signalling molecule known as nitric oxide, which also turned out to be regulating lipid droplets in cancerous cells. Further work then showed that drugs affecting nitric oxide could modulate lipid droplet size in both normal and tumor cells. This work has validated a new method to study the real-time behavior of lipid droplets and their responses to different stimuli in living cells. In the future, Lumaquin, Johns et al. hope that the technique will help to shed new light on how lipids are involved in both healthy and abnormal biological processes ."}

Here, we investigate assembly of PDZ scaffolds using supported cell membrane sheets, a unique experimental setup enabling direct access to the intracellular face of the cell membrane. Our data demonstrate how multivalent protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions provide critical avidity for the strong binding between the PDZ domain scaffold proteins, PICK1 and PSD-95, and their cognate transmembrane binding partners. The kinetics of the binding were remarkably slow and binding strength two-three orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic affinity for the isolated PDZ interaction. Interestingly, discrete changes in the intrinsic PICK1 PDZ affinity did not affect overall binding strength but instead revealed dual scaffold modes for PICK1. Our data supported by simulations suggest that intrinsic PDZ domain affinities are finely tuned and encode specific cellular responses, enabling multiplexed cellular functions of PDZ scaffolds.  It is of fundamental importance for cell function to organize signaling processes in space and time. Scaffold proteins play a key role in these efforts by operating as versatile nanoscale modules capable of bringing distinct molecular components in close proximity to shape specificity in cellular signaling networks and regulate output ( Good et al., 2011; Zeke et al., 2009 ). A broad variety of different protein-protein and protein-lipid interacting domains are found in scaffold proteins, enabling them to bind and direct localization and function of their diverse interaction partners, such as receptors, transporters, ion channels and kinases ( Hung and Sheng, 2002; Zhu et al., 2016 ). Our current understanding of the dynamics and kinetics underlying scaffold interactions relies mostly on in vitro assays of single domains isolated form their native membrane environment ( Vincentelli et al., 2015; Stiffler et al., 2007; Long et al., 2003; Ivarsson, 2012 ). Such approaches reduce the complexity and makes binding assays simpler to both perform and analyze. Nonetheless, the presence of several interaction domains in one protein, together with possible formation of higher order structures of both scaffold proteins and transmembrane interaction partners ( Long et al., 2003; Ivarsson, 2012 ), strongly suggest that measurements in vitro cannot replicate the behavior of the native environment. Furthermore, scaffold proteins often function on, or in proximity, to lipid cellular membranes, and several scaffold protein domains directly interact with lipids ( Egea-Jimenez et al., 2016; P\u00e9rez et al., 2013 ). PDZ ( PSD-95/Discs Large/ZO-1 ) domains constitute one of the most common interaction domains in scaffold proteins ( Feng and Zhang, 2009; Zhu et al., 2016; Ye and Zhang, 2013 ) and are characterized by an elongated binding groove that interacts with the last three to five C-terminal residues of the target proteins ( Doyle et al., 1996 ). Scaffold proteins often contain several PDZ domains permitting them to serve as adaptors to assemble protein complexes ( Doyle et al., 1996; Sheng and Sala, 2001; Feng and Zhang, 2009; Ye and Zhang, 2013 ). PICK1 ( Protein Interacting with C Kinase 1 ), for example, forms a dimeric structure containing two spatially separated, identical PDZ domains and a lipid binding N-BAR ( Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs ) domain ( Karlsen et al., 2015 ), enabling simultaneous binding of two interaction partners and tethering of the complex to the membrane ( Xu and Xia, 2006 ). To perform its differential functions, PICK1 is believed to operate in two distinct modes of scaffolding; one required for clustering transmembrane interaction partners, such as the AMPA-type glutamate receptors ( AMPARs ), the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 ( mGluR7 ), ephrin and the monoamine transporters ( Xia et al., 1999; Torres et al., 2001; Boudin et al., 2000; Torres et al., 1998 ), and one required for recruiting protein kinase C\u03b1 ( PKC\u03b1 ) to its transmembrane interaction partners to regulate their phosphorylation ( Baron et al., 2002; Dev et al., 2000; Perez et al., 2001; Staudinger et al., 1995 ). The molecular mechanisms underlying these different scaffold modes remain nevertheless unknown. In contrast to neuronal scaffold interactions, drug-receptor or antibody interactions have been studied rigorously in tissues and cells uncovering molecular mechanisms of co-operativity and avidity in many biological systems ( Varner et al., 2015 ). To enable similar studies of scaffold interactions with membrane proteins embedded in their natural membrane environment, we take here advantage of a supported cell membrane sheets ( SCMS ) technique ( Perez et al., 2006a; Perez et al., 2006b ). SCMS are prepared by pressing a glass cover-slip on an adherent cell culture. When the cover-slip is removed, the apical plasma membrane detaches from cells and a planar sheet exposing the inner surface of the membrane is exposed on the cover-slip. Binding of fluorescence labeled protein ligands to the membrane proteins exposed on the SCMS can be quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Strikingly, our data reveal binding strengths for PICK1, as well as for the PDZ tandem domain from PSD-95 ( Long et al., 2003; Cho et al., 1992 ), that are two to three orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic affinities measured in vitro. The binding strength for PICK1 is strongly dependent on an intact PDZ domain binding groove and the membrane-binding N-BAR domain but, surprisingly, independent of the tertiary and quaternary structure of the transmembrane PDZ binding partners. To our further surprise, the binding strength for PICK1 is insensitive to discrete changes in the intrinsic affinities of the PDZ binding partners, which instead are reflected in changes of maximal binding. Mathematical modeling of homo-bivalent binding demonstrates that the observed behavior is consistent with a change in the binding mode from a scenario where one PICK1 dimer binds two membrane ligands to a scenario where one PICK1 dimer binds one membrane ligand and has one free PDZ domain available for other interactions. Altogether, by quantitatively illuminating binding kinetics of PDZ domain protein scaffolds on a cell membrane, our results reveal novel principles for how cellular scaffold proteins can operate to ensure specificity and selectivity in cellular signaling networks, and furthermore how these principles change our current understanding of cellular binding equilibria and mechanisms underlying the function of scaffold proteins in general.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Inside a cell, many different signals carry information that is essential for the cell to remain healthy and perform its role in the body. It is, therefore, very important that the signals are sent to the right places at the right times. Scaffold proteins play an essential role in organizing these signals by bringing specific proteins and other molecules into close contact at particular times and locations within the cell. Defects in scaffolding proteins can lead to cancer, psychiatric disorders and other diseases, so these proteins represent potential new targets for medicinal drugs. Many scaffolding proteins assemble groups of proteins on the surface of the membrane that surrounds the cell. Previous studies have shown that scaffolding proteins are able to bind to several other proteins as well as the membrane itself at the same time. However, the precise way in which scaffolding proteins assemble such groups is not clear because it is technically challenging to study this process in living cells. To overcome this challenge, Erlendsson, Thorsen et al. used a new experimental setup known as supported cell membrane sheets \u2013 which provides direct access to the side of the cell membrane that usually faces into the cell \u2013 to study two scaffolding proteins known as PICK1 and PSD-95. The experiments show that PICK1 and PSD-95 bind to their partner proteins up to 100 times more strongly than previously observed using other approaches. This is due to the scaffolding proteins binding more strongly to both their partners and the membrane. Unexpectedly, the experiments show that the shape and physical characteristics of the partner protein have no effect on the increase in the strength of the binding. Further experiments suggest that altering the ability of the PDZ domain of PICK1 to bind to partner proteins changes the mode of action of the PICK1 protein so that it can activate different responses in the cell. Together these findings imply that the ability of scaffolding proteins to bind to their partner proteins is finely tuned to encode specific responses in cells in different situations \u2013 a hypothesis that Erlendsson, Thorsen et al. are planning to test in intact cells ."}

Here, the paracrine role of extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) in bone healing was investigated. First, purified human perivascular stem cells ( PSCs ) were observed to induce mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic effects on osteoprogenitor cells while in non-contact co-culture via elaboration of EVs. PSC-derived EVs shared mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic properties of their parent cell. PSC-EV effects were dependent on surface-associated tetraspanins, as demonstrated by EV trypsinization, or neutralizing antibodies for CD9 or CD81. Moreover, shRNA knockdown in recipient cells demonstrated requirement for the CD9/CD81 binding partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN for EV bioactivity. Finally, PSC-EVs stimulated bone repair, and did so via stimulation of skeletal cell proliferation, migration, and osteodifferentiation. In sum, PSC-EVs mediate the same tissue repair effects of perivascular stem cells, and represent an \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 alternative for bone tissue regeneration.  Stromal progenitor cells within vessel walls have multipotent properties ( Cathery et al., 2018; Corselli et al., 2012; Covas et al., 2008; Crisan et al., 2008; Dellavalle et al., 2007; Farrington-Rock et al., 2004 ), are native forerunners of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ), and participate in endogenous bone repair ( Diaz-Flores et al., 1991; Diaz-Flores et al., 1992; Grcevic et al., 2012 ). When purified based on expression of CD146 ( Mel-CAM ) and CD34, human perivascular stem cells ( PSCs ) from adipose tissue or other tissue compartments speed bone repair ( Askarinam et al., 2013; Chung et al., 2014; James et al., 2017a; James et al., 2012a; James et al., 2012b; Tawonsawatruk et al., 2016 ). Although direct incorporation of human PSCs into chondroblasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes occurs ( James et al., 2012b ), PSCs induce bone healing either primarily or exclusively via paracrine stimulation of the resident host cells within the defect niche ( Chung et al., 2014; Tawonsawatruk et al., 2016 ). High expression and secretion of osteoinductive proteins has been observed among freshly sorted or culture-expanded PSCs, including bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) among others ( Chen et al., 2009; Hardy et al., 2017; James et al., 2017b ). However, the exact paracrine intermediaries of PSC-induced bone defect healing are not known. Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ), including exosomes and microvesicles, carry a repertoire of bioactive molecules: proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates ( Colombo et al., 2014; Cvjetkovic et al., 2016; Mateescu et al., 2017 ). The heterogenous nature of EVs is well described, with EVs of a diameter\u00a0<100\u2013150 nm and multivesicular body ( MVB ) origin termed exosomes ( Gould and Raposo, 2013; Mateescu et al., 2017 ). Stromal progenitor cells elaborate EVs, and EVs have been observed to harbor many of the regenerative properties of their parent cell ( Lakhter and Sims, 2015 ). In bone repair, CD9 knockout mice, which have impaired EV elaboration, have delayed appendicular bone healing, that may be rescued by mesenchymal progenitor cell-derived EVs ( Furuta et al., 2016 ). As well, induced pluripotent stem\u00a0cell-derived EVs have been shown to incite osteogenesis and vasculogenesis in vivo ( Qin et al., 2016; Todorova et al., 2017 ). The potential role of miRNA cargo in EVs has been implicated in these effects, however the mechanisms that underlie EV-mediated reparative effects in bone are essentially unknown. Here, we observe that in similarity to their parent cell, PSC-derived EVs incite pleiotropic effects on skeletal progenitor cells, including mitogenic, pro-migratory, pro-osteogenic effects, and broad ranging changes in the cellular transcriptome of the recipient cell. These bioactive effects require EV tetraspanin activity, as well as expression of their binding partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN by the recipient progenitor cell. These cellular effects of PSC-EVs on skeletal progenitor cells converge to incite intramembranous bone repair in a mouse model.

Blood vessels are found throughout the body\u2019s tissues and are a source of cells that guide the process of repair. These cells, called perivascular stem cells ( PSCs ), are a type of stem cell found in the lining of blood vessels. Stem cells are cells that can become one of several different types of mature cells, depending on what the body needs. Extracellular vesicles are bundles of chemical signals that cells send into their external environment. Just like an address or a tag on a parcel, specific molecules mark the exterior surface of these bundles to deliver the message to the right recipient. Stem cells often use extracellular vesicles to communicate with surrounding cells. One role of PSCs is repairing damage to bones. Unusually, they do not turn into new bone cells and so do not directly contribute to the re-growing tissue. Instead, PSCs act indirectly, by stimulating the cells around them. How PSCs send these \u2018repair instructions\u2019 has, however, remained unclear. Xu et al. wanted to determine if PSCs used extracellular vesicles to direct bone repair, and if so, what \u2018tags\u2019 needed to be on the vesicles and on the receiving cells for this to happen. Experiments using PSCs and immature bone cells grown in the laboratory allowed the PSCs\u2019 effect on bone cells to be simulated in a Petri dish. The two types of cells were grown on either side of a barrier, which separated them physically but allowed chemical signals through. In response to the PSCs, the immature bone cells multiplied, started to move ( which is something they need to do to heal damaged tissue ), and began to resemble mature bone cells. Analysis of the signals released by the PSCs revealed that these were indeed extracellular vesicles, and that they were tagged by specific proteins called tetraspanins. Genetic manipulation of the immature bone cells later showed that these cells needed specific \u2018receiver\u2019 molecules to respond to the PSCs. Adding only extracellular vesicles to the bone cells, without any PSCs, confirmed that it was indeed the vesicles that triggered the healing response. Finally, giving the vesicles to mice with bone damage helped them to heal faster than untreated animals. These results have uncovered a key mechanism by which stem cells control the repair of bone tissue. This could one day lead to better treatments for patients recovering from fractures or needing bone surgery ."}

It operates via an 'alternating-access' mechanism, making iterative transitions between inward-facing ( E1 ) and outward-facing ( E2 ) conformations. Although the general features of the transport cycle are known, the detailed physicochemical factors governing the binding site selectivity remain mysterious. Free energy molecular dynamics simulations show that the ion binding sites switch their binding specificity in E1 and E2. This is accompanied by small structural arrangements and changes in protonation states of the coordinating residues. Additional computations on structural models of the intermediate states along the conformational transition pathway reveal that the free energy barrier toward the occlusion step is considerably increased when the wrong type of ion is loaded into the binding pocket, prohibiting the pump cycle from proceeding forward. This self-correcting mechanism strengthens the overall transport selectivity and protects the stoichiometry of the pump cycle.  The Na+/K+-pump is a primary active membrane transporter present in nearly all animal cells. It belongs to the P-type ATPase family, which utilizes the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to move ions against their concentration gradients across a membrane barrier. The ion species transported by the pump under physiological conditions are Na+ and K+. Like many other membrane transporters, the Na+/K+-pump works according to an 'alternating-access' ion transport mechanism, with the bound ions accessible from only one side of the membrane at a time. The consensus scheme of the pump cycle is known as the 'Albers-Post' cycle ( Albers, 1967; Post et al., 1969 ). It involves two major conformations, E1 and E2, with inward- and outward-facing ion binding sites, respectively. In each cycle, the E1 conformation binds three Na+ from the cytosol and exports them using the energy from ATP hydrolysis. After external release of Na+, binding of extracellular K+ promotes the structural transition to the occluded E2 state, which finally imports two K+ as binding of ATP returns the pump to the E1 conformation. E1/E2 conformational change and the accompanied electrogenic active transport are facilitated by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of an aspartate residue in the cytoplasmic domain, which is a hallmark of the P-type ATPase family ( Axelsen et al., 1998 ). The presence of the Na+/K+-pump is essential for excitability and secondary active transport. More than 40% of the energy produced in mammals is consumed by the Na+/K+-pump ( Milligan et al., 1985 ). Although it is a machine designed for such a precise and important function, it has been shown that many cations, including congeners of K+ and some organic cations, can bind to the same sites used by the pump to bind and transport K+ ions ( Mahmmoud et al., 2015; Ratheal et al., 2010 ). Competitive binding between Na+ and other cations at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane has also been observed ( Schneeberger et al., 2001 ). An unsolved puzzle, therefore, is how the Na+/K+-pump is able to recognize and accept two K+ from the extracellular matrix, where Na+ concentration is much higher, and how it selectively binds Na+ from the cytoplasm to keep the pump cycle running forward. Structural studies have provided tremendous insights into the function of the Na+/K+-pump, which consists of two obligatory subunits, \u03b1 ( catalytic ) and \u03b2 ( auxiliary ), and sometimes a tissue specific regulatory subunit from the FXYD protein family ( Geering, 2006; Mercer et al., 1993 ). The transmembrane region of the \u03b1-subunit contains the ion binding sites within its 10 helices ( called\u00a0M1-M10 ). Recent crystal structures of the pump in its E1 and E2 states reveal the locations of the three Na+ binding sites in E1 and the two K+ binding sites in E2 ( Kanai et al., 2013; Laursen et al., 2013; Morth et al., 2007; Shinoda et al., 2009 ). From structural alignments based on the heavy atom positions in the binding sites, it becomes clear that the binding pocket harboring sites I and II in E1 overlaps with those in E2 ( Figure 1 ). Site III is only formed in E1. It is located between the transmembrane helices M5, M6, and M8 and is thought to exclusively bind Na+ but appears to catalyze H+ transport ( Poulsen et al., 2010; Ratheal et al., 2010 ) in a manner that presents a complex dependence on the concentrations of Na+, K+, and H+ ( Mitchell et al., 2014 ). Previous studies have indicated that protonation at the ion binding pocket may play a role in the selectivity of these sites for K+ when the pump is in its E2 state ( Yu et al., 2011 ). Biochemical assays on the mutant D926N, which is often used as a surrogate for protonated D926, also show that it induces distinct effects on Na+ and K+ binding ( Einholm et al., 2010; Jewell-Motz et al., 1993 ), suggesting a potential change in its protonation state upon the E1/E2 transition. Taken together, the evidence, although indirect, suggests the possibility of an E1 specific protonation state that favors Na+ binding to the pump. The nature of this protonation state is, however, unclear. 10. 7554/eLife. 16616. 003Figure 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 16616. 003 In the present study, we started with the recently published crystal structure of the Na+/K+-pump in a partially occluded Na3\u00b7E1 ( ADP\u00b7Pi ) state and used molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations to show that there is a correlation between the binding pocket protonation and the Na+ selectivity in E1. The binding sites in Na3\u00b7E1 ( ADP\u00b7Pi ) were tested one by one by 'alchemically transforming' the bound Na+ into a K+ while keeping the other two sites occupied by Na+. A similar approach was previously used to study the selectivity in other conformational states of the pump ( Yu et al., 2011 ) ( see also Materials and methods section ). The results show that the Na+ selectivity at all three sites is realized only when a specific set of binding pocket residues are protonated. This set of residues is, by comparison, different from that in the K+ selective E2 state. The implication is that the protonation state and the selectivity of the pump are tightly coupled; when the pump undergoes a transition between E1 and E2, a protonation state switch occurs. The present findings also show that the effective selectivity of the pump is reinforced by a self-correcting mechanism, which prevents the occlusion step on either side of the membrane if the wrong type of ions were loaded into the binding sites. This mechanism ensures that counterproductive transport cycles do not occur.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: A protein called the sodium-potassium pump resides in the membrane that surrounds living cells. The role of this protein is to 'pump' sodium and potassium ions across the membrane to help restore their concentration inside and outside of the cell. About 25% of the body's energy is used to keep the pump going, rising to nearly 70% in the brain. Problems that affect the pump have been linked to several disorders, including heart, kidney and metabolic diseases, as well as severe neurological conditions. The sodium-potassium pump must be able to effectively pick out the correct ions to transport from a mixture of many different types of ions. However, it was not clear how the pump succeeds in doing this efficiently. Rui et al. have now used a computational method called molecular dynamics simulations to model how the sodium-potassium pump transports the desired ions across the cell membrane. The pump works via a so-called 'alternating-access' mechanism, repeatedly transitioning between inward-facing and outward-facing conformations. In each cycle, it binds three sodium ions from the cell\u2019s interior and exports them to the outside. Then, the pump binds to two potassium ions from outside the cell and imports them inside. Although the bound sodium and potassium ions interact with similar binding sites in the pump, the pump sometimes preferentially binds sodium, and sometimes potassium. The study performed by Rui et al. shows that this preference is driven by how protons ( hydrogen ions ) bind to the amino acids that make up the binding site. The simulations also suggest that the pump uses a \u2018self-correcting\u2019 mechanism to prevent the pump from transporting the wrong types of ions. When incorrect ions are present at the binding sites, the pump cycle pauses temporarily until the ions detach from the pump. Only when the correct ions are bound will the pump cycle continue again. In the future, Rui et al. hope to use long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations to show the conformational transition in action. In addition, the 'self-correcting' mechanism will be directly tested by letting the wrong and correct ions compete for the binding sites to see whether the pump will transport only the correct ions ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMany cellular processes are driven by cytoskeletal assemblies. It remains unclear how cytoskeletal filaments and motor proteins organize into cellular scale structures and how molecular properties of cytoskeletal components affect the large-scale behaviors of these systems. Here, we investigate the self-organization of stabilized microtubules in Xenopus oocyte extracts and find that they can form macroscopic networks that spontaneously contract. We propose that these contractions are driven by the clustering of microtubule minus ends by dynein. Based on this idea, we construct an active fluid theory of network contractions, which predicts a dependence of the timescale of contraction on initial network geometry, a development of density inhomogeneities during contraction, a constant final network density, and a strong influence of dynein inhibition on the rate of contraction, all in quantitative agreement with experiments. These results demonstrate that the motor-driven clustering of filament ends is a generic mechanism leading to contraction.  The mechanics, motions, and internal organization of eukaryotic cells are largely determined by the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton consists of filaments, such as actin and microtubules, and molecular motors, which consume chemical energy to exert forces on and arrange the filaments into large-scale networks. Motor proteins, including dynein and roughly 14 different families of kinesin ( Wordeman, 2010 ), organize microtubules to form the spindle, which segregates chromosomes during cell division. The motor protein myosin organizes actin filaments into networks which drive cell motility, polarity, cytokinesis, and left-right symmetry breakage ( Mitchinson and Cramer, 1996; Mayer et al., 2010; Naganathan et al., 2014 ). The non-equilibrium nature of motor activity is essential for the organization of the cytoskeleton into these diverse sub-cellular structures, but it remains unclear how the interactions between filaments, different motor proteins, and other biomolecules influence the behaviors of the networks they form. In particular, it is difficult to extrapolate from the biochemical properties of motors characterized in reconstituted systems to the biological function of those motors in vivo. To address this question, we study self-organization of cytoskeletal filaments in Xenopus extracts, which recapitulate the biochemical complexity of the in vivo system. The self-organization of cytoskeletal filaments has been extensively studied in cell extracts and in reconstituted systems of purified components. Actin can form macroscopic networks that exhibit a myosin-dependent bulk contraction ( Murrell and Gardel, 2012; Bendix et al., 2008; K\u00f6hler and Bausch, 2012; Alvarado et al., 2013; Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi, 1943 ). Microtubule networks purified from neuronal extracts have also been observed to undergo bulk contraction ( Weisenberg and Cianci, 1984 ), while microtubules in mitotic and meiotic extracts are found to assemble into asters ( Gaglio et al., 1995; Mountain et al., 1999; Verde et al., 1991 ). Aster formation in meiotic Xenopus egg extracts is dynein-dependent, and has been proposed to be driven by the clustering of microtubule minus ends by dynein ( Verde et al., 1991 ). It has also been suggested that dynein binds to the minus ends of microtubules in spindles and clusters the minus ends of microtubules to form spindle poles ( Heald et al., 1996; Burbank et al., 2007; Khodjakov et al., 2003; Goshima et al., 2005; Elting et al., 2014 ) and dynein has been shown to accumulate on microtubule minus ends in a purified system ( McKenney et al., 2014 ). Purified solutions of microtubules and kinesin can also form asters ( N\u00e9d\u00e9lec et al., 1997; Hentrich and Surrey, 2010; Urrutia et al., 1991 ), or under other conditions, dynamic liquid crystalline networks ( Sanchez et al., 2012 ). Hydrodynamic theories have been proposed to describe the behaviors of cytoskeletal networks on length scales that are much greater than the size of individual filaments and motor proteins ( Prost et al., 2015, Marchetti et al., 2013 ). These phenomenological theories are based on symmetries and general principles of non-equilibrium physics, with the details of the microscopic process captured by a small number of effective parameters. As hydrodynamic theories are formulated at the continuum level, they cannot be used to derive the values of their associated parameters, which must be obtained from more microscopic theories ( Prost et al., 2015, Marchetti et al., 2013 ) or by comparison to experiments ( Mayer et al., 2010; Brugu\u00e9s and Needleman, 2014 ). A key feature of networks of cytoskeletal filaments and motor proteins that enters hydrodynamic theories, and differentiates these non-equilibrium systems from passive polymer networks, is the presence of additional, active stresses ( Prost et al., 2015, Marchetti et al., 2013 ). These active stresses can be contractile or extensile, with profound implications for the large-scale behavior of cytoskeletal networks. Contractile stresses can result from a preferred association of motors with filament ends ( Kruse and J\u00fclicher, 2000; Hyman and Karsenti, 1996 ), nonlinear elasticity of the network ( Liverpool et al., 2009 ), or the buckling of individual filaments ( Murrell and Gardel, 2012; Lenz, 2014; Soares e Silva et al., 2011 ). Extensile active stresses can arise from polarity sorting or result from the mechanical properties of individual molecular motors ( Gao et al., 2015; Blackwell et al. 2015 ). In networks with dynamically growing and shrinking filaments, polymerization dynamics can also contribute to the active stress. Experimentally, acto-myosin systems ( Murrell and Gardel, 2012; Bendix et al., 2008; K\u00f6hler and Bausch, 2012; Alvarado et al., 2013; Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi, 1943 ) and microtubule networks from neuronal extracts ( Weisenberg and Cianci, 1984 ) are observed to be contractile, while purified solutions of microtubules and kinesin can form extensile liquid crystalline networks ( Sanchez et al., 2012 ). It is unclear which microscopic properties of filaments and motor proteins dictate if the active stress is contractile or extensile in these different systems. Here, we investigate the motor-driven self-organization of stabilized microtubules in Xenopus meiotic egg extracts. These extracts are nearly undiluted cytoplasm and recapitulate a range of cell biological processes, including spindle assembly and chromosome segregation ( Hannak and Heald, 2006 ). We have discovered that, in addition to microtubules forming asters in this system as previously reported ( Verde et al., 1991 ), the asters assemble themselves into a macroscopic network that undergoes a bulk contraction. We quantitatively characterized these contractions and found that their detailed behavior can be well understood using a simple coarse-grained model of a microtubule network in which dynein drives the clustering of microtubule minus ends. This end clustering mechanism leads to a novel form of active stress, which drives the system to a preferred microtubule density. Our results suggest that the dynein-driven clustering of microtubule minus ends causes both aster formation and network contraction, and have strong implications for understanding the role of dynein in spindle assembly and pole formation. Furthermore, the close agreement we find between experiments and theory demonstrates that simple continuum models can accurately describe the behavior of the cytoskeleton, even in complex biological systems.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The ability of cells to move, divide, and carry out other processes depends on networks of protein filaments and motor proteins collectively known as the cytoskeleton. The motor proteins can move along the filaments to transport molecules and larger structures around the cell, or to rearrange the filaments themselves. The cytoskeleton of animal, plant, and other eukaryotic cells contains two main types of filaments, known as actin filaments and microtubules. Both types of filament have distinct ends, known as the plus and minus ends. Previous studies have revealed that networks of actin filaments can rapidly contract to drive the movement of muscles and other processes. However, it is not known whether networks of microtubules can also contract. Foster et al. studied the microtubules in extracts made from the eggs of a frog called Xenopus laevis. The experiments show that these microtubules form networks that can spontaneously contract. Foster et al. propose that this contraction is caused by the minus ends of the microtubules clustering together due to the activities of a motor protein called dynein. To test this idea, Foster et al. developed a mathematical model based on an 'active fluid' theory. This model makes predictions that agree very well with the experimental data. The next step in this work is to find out if this model of microtubule contraction applies to other networks of microtubules ."}

We found that most populations of dopamine neurons receive a similar set of inputs rather than forming strong reciprocal connections with their target areas. A common feature among most populations of dopamine neurons was the existence of dense \u2018clusters\u2019 of inputs within the ventral striatum. However, we found that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum were outliers, receiving relatively few inputs from the ventral striatum and instead receiving more inputs from the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and zona incerta. These results lay a foundation for understanding the input/output structure of the midbrain dopamine circuit and demonstrate that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum constitute a unique class of dopamine neurons regulated by different inputs.  A longstanding challenge in neuroscience is to understand how neurons compute their output by integrating information from multiple sources. Mapping precise neural connectivity is a critical step towards understating neural computation. Recent developments in viral, molecular, and imaging techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to outline various aspects of the brain's wiring diagram in systematic and quantitative manners ( Denk et al., 2012; Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012; Huang and Zeng, 2013; Osten and Margrie, 2013; Pollak Dorocic et al., 2014; Hart et al., 2014; Ogawa et al., 2014; Oh et al., 2014; Weissbourd et al., 2014; Callaway and Luo, 2015 ). Midbrain dopamine neurons play important roles in various brain functions including motivation, reinforcement learning, and motor control ( Wise, 2004; Redgrave and Gurney, 2006; Ikemoto, 2007; Schultz, 2007 ). Recording experiments have shown that many dopamine neurons signal reward prediction error ( RPE ) : the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward value ( Schultz et al., 1997; Bayer and Glimcher, 2005; Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Clark et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2012; Schultz, 2015 ). Classically, it is thought that RPE coding is relatively uniform among dopamine neurons, and that dopamine's major function is to guide behavior toward maximizing future rewards. However, recent studies have suggested that there are at least two types of dopamine neurons, value-coding and salience-coding ( Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009 ), although the extent of physiological diversity remains controversial ( Fiorillo, 2013; Fiorillo et al., 2013a, 2013b ). Most dopamine neurons reside in midbrain nuclei called the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ), the substantia nigra pars compacta ( SNc ), and the retrorubral field ( RRF ). Clusters of dopamine neurons in and around these nuclei are designated A10, A9, and A8, respectively. In the mouse brain, just \u223c30, 000 dopamine neurons reside in these nuclei ( Zaborszky and Vadasz, 2001 ). As with other monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain such as serotonin and noradrenaline, this small population of midbrain dopamine neurons exerts its influence over much of the brain as a neuromodulator. However, compared to the other monoamine neuromodulators, the dopamine system is anatomically unique in that the collateralization of dopamine neurons is limited ( Moore and Bloom, 1978; Swanson, 1982; Sobel and Corbett, 1984 ). In other words, unlike the other monoaminergic neurons, a single dopamine neuron tends to target just one brain area, raising the possibility that different functional populations can be defined by the region that they target. Recent studies have shown that dopamine neurons projecting to different targets have distinct properties ( Lammel et al., 2008, 2011, 2012, 2014; Kim et al., 2014 ). For instance, a population of dopamine neurons in the posterior medial VTA that projects to the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) in mice, is unique with respect to many features: low expression of dopamine transporter ( DAT ), tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ), and the D2 dopamine receptor, narrow spike waveform, high baseline firing and low level of cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity ( Lammel et al., 2008, 2011, 2012, 2014 ). Dopamine neurons that project to different areas are located at slightly different, but highly overlapping locations in the midbrain ( Swanson, 1982; Yetnikoff et al., 2014 ). These results have raised the possibility that projection target, rather than anatomical location, can better classify functional groups of dopamine neurons. To understand how dopamine neurons compute their output, it is critical to know their inputs. Early systematic studies produced a thorough list of input areas to dopaminergic nuclei ( Geisler and Zahm, 2005; Geisler et al., 2007 ) using conventional tracers. A recent study using a cell-type specific transsynaptic tracing method employing a rabies virus confirmed that many of these areas actually project directly onto dopamine neurons ( Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012 ). This study also showed that VTA dopamine neurons received a distinct set of inputs compared to SNc dopamine neurons. It is possible that the differences observed in this study between inputs to VTA and SNc dopamine neurons were attributable to the uneven distribution of populations of dopamine neurons with different projection targets between these two nuclei. Both VTA and SNc contain dopamine neurons projecting to different targets, and each population of dopamine neurons projecting to a given target is distributed in a complex manner, often encompassing both VTA and SNc. Thus, it remains to be determined whether dopamine neurons projecting to different targets receive different or similar inputs. In the present study, we classified dopamine neurons according to their projection targets and defined the distribution of monosynaptic inputs of each subpopulation. We compared the inputs of dopamine neurons defined by eight major targets: different parts of the striatum ( ventral striatum [VS], dorsal striatum [DS], tail of the striatum [TS] ), cortex ( mPFC, orbitofrontal cortex [OFC] ), central amygdala ( Amy ), globus pallidus ( GP ), and lateral habenula ( lHb ). To collect and analyze this large data set, we developed a data acquisition and analysis pipeline using a brain clearing method ( CLARITY ) ( Chung and Deisseroth, 2013 ), whole-brain imaging using light-sheet microscopy ( Keller et al., 2010 ), and semi-automated software for analysis. We found that populations of dopamine neurons projecting to most of these targets receive a similar set of inputs, while dopamine neurons projecting to TS ( \u2018tail of the striatum\u2019 or \u2018posterior striatum\u2019 ) are a clear outlier. These results indicate that classifying dopamine neurons based on their projection target is a viable approach, and lay a foundation for studying the mechanisms by which dopamine neurons are regulated. Our approach is based on an automated imaging and analysis suite that will facilitate similar anatomical studies in other brain systems in an efficient and quantitative manner.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Most neurons send their messages to recipient neurons by releasing a substance called a \u2018neurotransmitter\u2019 that binds to receptors on the target cell. The sites of this type of signal transmission are called synapses. Some small populations of neurons modulate the activity of hundreds or thousands of these synapses all across the brain by releasing \u2018neuromodulators\u2019 that affect how they work. These neuromodulators are essential because they broadcast information that is likely to be useful to many brain regions, like a \u2018news channel\u2019 for the brain. One important neuromodulator in the mammalian brain is dopamine, which contributes to motivation, learning, and the control of movement. Clusters of cells deep in the brain release dopamine, and people with Parkinson's disease gradually lose these cells. This makes it increasingly difficult for their brains to produce the correct amount of dopamine, and results in symptoms such as tremors and stiff muscles. Individual dopamine neurons typically send information to a single part of the brain. This suggests that dopamine neurons with different targets might have different roles. To explore this possibility, Menegas et al. classified dopamine neurons in the mouse brain into eight types based on the areas to which they project, and then mapped which neurons send input signals to each type. These inputs are likely to shape the activity of each type ( that is, their \u2018message\u2019 to the rest of the brain ). The mapping revealed that most dopamine neurons do not receive substantial input from the area to which they project ( i. e., they do not form \u2018closed loops\u2019 ). Instead, most of their input comes from a common set of brain regions, including a particularly large number of inputs from the ventral striatum. However, Menegas et al. found one exception. Dopamine neurons that target part of the brain called the posterior striatum receive relatively little input from the ventral striatum. Their input comes instead from a set of other brain structures, and in particular from a region called the subthalamic nucleus. Electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus can help to relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the results presented by Menegas et al. suggest that this population of dopamine neurons might be particularly relevant to Parkinson's disease and that focusing future studies on them could ultimately be beneficial for patients ."}

For palmitoylation to occur, membrane association is a prerequisite, but it is unclear which motif may increase the affinities of the proteins for the target membrane. In experiments with rat neuroendocrine cells, we find that a few basic amino acids in the cysteine-rich region of SNAP25 and SNAP23 are essential for plasma membrane targeting. Reconstitution of membrane-protein binding in a liposome assay shows that the mechanism involves protein electrostatics between basic amino acid residues and acidic lipids such as phosphoinositides that play a primary role in these interactions. Hence, we identify an electrostatic anchoring mechanism underlying initial plasma membrane contact by SNARE proteins, which subsequently become palmitoylated at the plasma membrane.  Palmitoylation is a post-translational modification of a protein which causes its stable attachment to a cellular membrane. Examples of proteins that follow this paradigm are the homologous SNARE ( soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor ) proteins SNAP25 and SNAP23, which\u00a0after translation are initially\u00a0cytosolic proteins. In order to function in vesicle fusion, they relocate to the plasma membrane. SNAP23 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas\u00a0the neuronal SNAP25 is highly abundant in the synapse and in the plasma membrane of neuroendocrine cells ( Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012; Wilhelm et al., 2014; Knowles et al., 2010 ). Stable attachment to membranes is achieved after palmitoylation of a cysteine cluster, which\u00a0is\u00a0most probably\u00a0catalyzed by the\u00a0plasma\u00a0membrane resident palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC2. DHHC2 is characterized by the presence of a conserved DH ( H/Y ) C motif and can palmitoylate SNAP25 and SNAP23 ( Greaves et al., 2010 ). The majority of SNAP25 molecules\u00a0reside in the plasma membrane, while 20% are located in a perinuclear recycling endosome-trans-Golgi network ( Aikawa et al., 2006 ). A two-compartment model for SNAP25 trafficking has been proposed which\u00a0speculates that the\u00a0endocytic recycling of\u00a0SNAP25\u00a0might be coupled to its depalmitoylation, followed by its\u00a0repalmitoylation and recycling back to the plasma membrane ( Aikawa et al., 2006 ). In any case, in steady-state, the large majority of SNAP25 molecules\u00a0are stably attached to the cell membrane. The minimal domain necessary\u00a0for SNAP25 plasma\u00a0membrane targeting has been mapped to amino acids 85\u2013120 ( Gonzalo et al., 1999 ), comprising the cysteine cluster\u00a0at the N-terminus ( for relevant SNAP25 region see Figure 1 ), while the C-terminus\u00a0interacts with DHHC proteins ( Gonzalo et al., 1999; Greaves et al., 2010 ). For DHHC interactions to occur, proximity to the membrane is an important factor and could even\u00a0be rate limiting in the attachment process. 10. 7554/eLife. 19394. 003Figure 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 19394. 005 SNAP25 and SNAP23 are not modified in the cytosol by isoprenyl- or myristoyl\u00a0groups, which would increase their membrane affinity and facilitate initial membrane contact; neither receptors nor membrane-targeting motifs have been identified previously and thus there has been some debate over how this initial contact may be mediated. Polybasic amino acid patches are known to mediate non-specific interactions with anionic lipids. For instance, plasma\u00a0membrane targeting of myristoylated K-Ras requires an\u00a0N-terminal polybasic domain ( Cadwallader et al., 1994; Wright and Philips, 2006 ), which localizes G protein \u03b1 subunits to the plasma membrane, although this region is not required for subunit palmitoylation ( Pedone and Hepler, 2007; Crouthamel et al., 2008 ). Other examples suggest that phosphorylation of basic residues located upstream of palmitoylated cysteines regulates the\u00a0palmitoylation of a potassium channel through an electrostatic switch ( Jeffries et al., 2012 ). In some instances, polybasic patches are the main driving force for protein attachment to the negatively charged plasma membrane ( Cho and Stahelin, 2005 ). SNAP25 has a net negative charge: of its 206 amino acids, 21% are negatively and 14% are positively charged. Still, a modest excess of three positive charges around the cysteine cluster might be available for non-specific interactions with anionic lipids. Nevertheless, this charge accumulation appears very small\u00a0when compared to the number of positive charges that\u00a0mediate electrostatic contacts in other cellular processes ( Heo et al., 2006 ). Here, we set out to investigate whether the subcellular distribution of SNAP25 and SNAP23 can be regulated through such a small accumulation of positive charges, despite the proteins\u2019 overall negative net charge.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells often communicate with each other by releasing chemicals that normally are stored in small membrane-bound compartments called vesicles. For example, when a neuron is stimulated, vesicles merge with its cell membrane and release their content into a gap between itself and other neurons. This complicated process involves many steps and molecules, including proteins called SNAREs. Some SNARE proteins reside at the inner side of the cell membrane and help vesicles to fuse with this membrane. Two SNARE proteins called SNAP25 and SNAP23 are produced in the liquid inside the cell and initially float freely. Eventually, these proteins become directly anchored to the cell membrane, however, not much is known about what happens to these proteins in between these stages, or how they first attach to the membrane before anchoring to it. Electrostatic forces between oppositely charged molecules are known to be important for them to bind with each other. Here, electrostatic forces are less likely to occur because SNAP25 and SNAP23 are both mostly negatively charged, and should therefore be repelled from the cell membrane, which also typically has a negative charge. However, both SNAP25 and SNAP23 have a small cluster of positively charged amino acids ( the building blocks of proteins ) near the attachment site, and Weber et al. have now tested whether this charge is sufficient to overcome the predicted repulsion. The approach involved making mutant proteins with either more or less positively charged attachment regions. Mutant SNAP25 or SNAP23 proteins with more positive charges may stick more tightly but not necessarily more permanently to the membrane. However, when the number of positive charges was lowered, more of the proteins remained floating freely in the liquid inside the cell. These results suggest that even a small number of positively charged amino acids is sufficient to help a protein bind to a cell membrane for further processing. The findings of Weber et al. reveal an early step in the life cycle of SNAP25 and SNAP23 before they anchor to the cell membrane. They suggest that finely tuned protein electrostatics can regulate how long a protein spends at a specific site and thereby indirectly determine its fate. Such fine-tuned protein electrostatics are difficult to recognize and could represent an underestimated regulatory mechanism in all types of cells ."}

However, the molecular nature of these barriers, their mode of action and their cellular functions are unclear. Here, we show that misfolded proteins of the ER remain confined into the mother compartment of budding yeast cells. Confinement required the formation of a lateral diffusion barrier in the form of a distinct domain of the ER-membrane at the bud neck, in a septin-, Bud1 GTPase- and sphingolipid-dependent manner. The sphingolipids, but not Bud1, also contributed to barrier formation in the outer membrane of the dividing nucleus. Barrier-dependent confinement of ER stress into the mother cell promoted aging. Together, our data clarify the physical nature of lateral diffusion barriers in the ER and establish the role of such barriers in the asymmetric segregation of proteotoxic misfolded proteins during cell division and aging.  Cellular diversity in eukaryotes relies in many instances on the asymmetric partition of cell fate determinants between daughter cells at cell division. In such instances, asymmetric cell division generates daughters with different division potentials. For example, most somatic cells exhibit a limited division potential, whereas the stem cells that generate them can divide indefinitely. Understanding the basis for these differences is critical for cell biology, aging research and regenerative medicine. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae divides in an asymmetric manner through the budding of daughters from the surface of the mother cell. While these daughters are born young and form eternal lineages, the mother cells divides only a limited number of times ( 20\u201350 ) before stopping and dying. This process, termed replicative aging ( Egilmez and Jazwinski, 1989; Kennedy et al., 1994; Steinkraus et al., 2008 ), is a consequence of the retention and accumulation of aging factors in the mother cell. A large variety of cellular features have been implicated in limiting the life span of yeast mother cells, including DNA-repair by-products called extra-chromosomal ribosomal DNA circles ( ERCs ), carbonylated proteins, oxidized lipids ( Nystr\u00f6m, 2005; Steinkraus et al., 2008 ), multi drug transporters ( Eldakak et al., 2010 ), vacuolar pH and mitochondrial integrity ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012 ). How many more factors contribute to aging, whether and how these factors influence each other, which of them are early and primary causes of aging, and which of them actually kill the cell at the end of its life remain unclear. We also know little about how the segregation of these factors is biased towards the mother cell during mitosis. Recent data indicated that a lateral diffusion barrier in the outer nuclear membrane compartmentalizes the dividing nucleus and promotes the retention of DNA circles in the mother compartment ( Shcheprova et al., 2008 ) and ERC accumulation ( Lindstrom et al., 2011 ). Accordingly, barrier defective cells are long-lived while their successive daughters become progressively shorter lived as they are born to mothers of increasing age. However, these mothers still age, indicating that they still accumulate some aging factors. Furthermore, the retention of old multi drug transporters in the mother cell is independent of the diffusion barriers ( Eldakak et al., 2010 ). Thus, several mechanisms control the segregation of aging factors towards the mother cell. However, what these mechanisms are and what their respective contribution to age segregation is remain unclear. Lateral diffusion barriers have been described in a number of eukaryotic membranes, including the initial segment of axons, dendritic spines, tight junctions of epithelial cells, the base of primary cilia, and the neck of budding yeast cells ( Myles et al., 1984; Winckler and Mellman, 1999; Barral et al., 2000; Takizawa et al., 2000; Matter and Balda, 2003; Nakada et al., 2003; Luedeke et al., 2005; Vieira et al., 2006; Shcheprova et al., 2008; Caudron and Barral, 2009 ). However, we still know very little about their physical nature and their mechanisms of action. The membrane systems of budding yeast cells are compartmentalized by at least three lateral diffusion barriers, one in the plasma membrane ( Barral et al., 2000; Takizawa et al., 2000 ), one in the cortical ER ( cER, Luedeke et al., 2005 ) and one in the outer membrane of the dividing nucleus ( Shcheprova et al., 2008; Boettcher et al., 2012 ). Their assembly at the bud neck depends on a family of filament-forming GTPases, the septins ( Faty et al., 2002; Weirich et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Saarikangas and Barral, 2011 ), and on the actin- and formin-interacting protein Bud6 ( Amberg et al., 1995, 1997; Luedeke et al., 2005; Shcheprova et al., 2008 ). Numerous questions remain concerning their molecular composition, their assembly, and their respective roles in cellular physiology. The ER is the site of folding and maturation of secretory proteins and protein complexes. A significant fraction of nascent secretory proteins fail to fold, are not correctly glycosylated, or are unable to find their destined partners ( Turner and Varshavsky, 2000; Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003; Princiotta et al., 2003 ). When accumulating, these misfolded proteins activate the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and are recognized by the ER-associated degradation ( ERAD ) machinery, retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm, polyubiquitinated and targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome ( Turner and Varshavsky, 2000; Ron and Walter, 2007; Brodsky and Skach, 2011 ). These quality control pathways play an important role in preventing or responding to ER stress, which can otherwise lead to cell death ( Tabas and Ron, 2011 ). However, whether ER stress contributes to aging is unknown. To address the nature and function of the different diffusion barriers in the yeast ER, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the compartmentalization of the cortical ER and their potential contribution to the retention of misfolded ER proteins in the mother cell.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cell division isn't always about splitting a cell into two identical parts. The diversity of many of our own cells relies on asymmetric cell divisions. The yeast used to make bread rely on a process called \u2018budding\u2019 that involves a small daughter cell emerging from the surface of the mother cell. Mother cells can only produce around 20\u201350 daughter cells before dying from old age. However, their daughters are always born rejuvenated, and not aged like their mothers. Budding involves part of the plasma membrane that surrounds the mother cell being pinched off to produce the daughter cell. This part of the membrane contains diffusion barriers that prevent various factors\u2014including factors that cause aging\u2014from entering the daughter cell. The barriers are known to contain several layers, but the details of how they work were not understood. Inside the budding cell, the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) also contains lateral diffusion barriers. The ER is the structure in the cell responsible for folding newly made proteins correctly. Any misfolded, toxic proteins are kept in the ER to be refolded or destroyed. However, if there are too many misfolded proteins, the ER gets stressed and triggers a mechanism that in extreme cases causes the cell to self-destruct. Clay, Caudron et al. have now shown that ER stress causes yeast cells to age. Moreover, when the ER is stressed, the ER diffusion barrier prevents the stress that causes aging entering the daughter cells. Clay, Caudron et al. also established that the diffusion barrier in the ER is made up of three layers. A layer of fatty molecules called sphingolipids is found at the bottom of the barrier, and such a layer is also present in other diffusion barriers. This could therefore act as the skeleton on which diffusion barriers form. Further investigation of this layer should provide a better understanding of how diffusion barriers work ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nIntrinsically disordered proteins/regions ( IDPs/IDRs ) are proteins or peptide segments that fail to form stable 3-dimensional structures in the absence of partner proteins. They are abundant in eukaryotic proteomes and are often associated with human diseases, but their biological functions have been elusive to study. In this study, we report the identification of a tin ( IV ) oxochloride-derived cluster that binds an evolutionarily conserved IDR within the metazoan TFIID transcription complex. Binding arrests an isomerization of promoter-bound TFIID that is required for the engagement of Pol II during the first ( de novo ) round of transcription initiation. However, the specific chemical probe does not affect reinitiation, which requires the re-entry of Pol II, thus, mechanistically distinguishing these two modes of transcription initiation. This work also suggests a new avenue for targeting the elusive IDRs by harnessing certain features of metal-based complexes for mechanistic studies, and for the development of novel pharmaceutical interventions.  Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions ( IDPs/IDRs ) constitute a significant fraction of the metazoan proteome ( Liu et al., 2006; Uversky, 2013 ). By virtue of their structural malleability and propensity to interact with multiple-binding partners, these peptide stretches of \u223c30 or more amino acid residues have become increasingly recognized for their pivotal and prevalent role in cellular functions including many implicated in human disease pathogenesis ( Babu et al., 2011 ). IDRs usually function through transient and weak interactions, rendering them difficult subjects for mechanistic studies. IDRs are typically composed of low-complexity sequences and are often rich in polar amino acid residues, making them challenging targets for intervention by conventional small-molecule inhibitors, which often require stable hydrophobic-binding pockets ( Metallo, 2010 ). However, conceptually, this feature of IDRs may be suitable for interactions with the hydrophilic and periodic metal\u2013oxygen backbones found in a group of metal clusters known as polyoxometalates ( POMs ). POMs, primarily composed of transition metals and oxygen, have been previously reported to exhibit potent biological activities ( Rhule et al., 1998 ), although these activities are rather promiscuous due to POMs' limited structural diversity, large size, and dependence on charge-based interactions in protein binding ( Judd et al., 2001; Li et al., 2009; Geng et al., 2011; Narasimhan et al., 2011 ). Efforts have been made to improve the specificity and potency of POMs ( Flutsch et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2014 ), and it seems that biological application of this metal complex-based protein-targeting strategy could benefit from new chemistry beyond conventional POMs to gain greater chemical space. Transcription initiation by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) is a highly regulated process requiring the coordinated actions of Pol II and a group of general transcription factors ( GTFs, i. e., TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH ) ( Roeder, 1996 ). Of all the GTFs, TFIID is the one with intrinsic DNA sequence specificity and is responsible for nucleating the assembly of a preinitiation complex ( PIC ) at core promoters ( Roeder, 1996 ). TFIID-promoter binding, which can be further stabilized by TFIIA, creates a platform for TFIIB loading, which in turn allows the engagement of TFIIF and Pol II. TFIIE and TFIIH are the last to join the PIC, after which promoter melting and RNA synthesis can occur. After Pol II leaves the promoter during the initial ( de novo ) round of transcription, a reinitiation scaffold containing TFIID has been proposed to remain on the DNA template and facilitate subsequent rounds of transcription ( reinitiation ) in reconstituted mammalian systems ( Hawley and Roeder, 1987; Zawel et al., 1995 ). TFIID is a protein complex composed of the TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) and \u223c14 TBP-associated factors ( TAFs ) ( Albright and Tjian, 2000; Matangkasombut et al., 2004 ). TBP recognizes and binds to the TATA box, while TAF1 and TAF2 recognize the Initiator element ( Inr ), and the TAF6-TAF9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element ( DPE ) ( Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010 ). It is generally accepted that higher TFIID-promoter affinity leads to more robust transcription, and indeed it is thought that a primary role of sequence-specific activators is to recruit TFIID to promoters ( Roeder, 1996; Albright and Tjian, 2000; Matangkasombut et al., 2004; Juven-Gershon et al., 2006 ). However, transcription initiation is a dynamic process and the release of at least a portion of the TFIID-promoter DNA contacts has been shown to be a critical step for productive initiation ( Yakovchuk et al., 2010 ). In addition, TFIID may assume diverse structures and its recognition of core promoter elements can be modulated by activators and post translational modifications ( Lewis et al., 2005; Juven-Gershon et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Cianfrocco et al., 2013 ). These distinct functional states of TFIID and their transitions are likely critical for gene-specific transcription regulation, but they are difficult to probe by conventional biochemistry and genetic analysis. In a search for small molecule compounds to selectively perturb TFIID function, we identified a tin-based metal cluster as a specific binder and modulator targeting an IDR within the TAF2 subunit of metazoan TFIID. By virtue of its specificity for interfering with the first round of transcription initiation, this metal cluster compound serves as a useful tool for studying the role of TFIID in both transcription initiation and reinitiation. This non-POM metal cluster revealed a novel mode of interaction with a low-complexity protein domain, demonstrating the feasibility of using metal-based compounds to selectively target IDRs.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: DNA contains instructions to make all the proteins and other molecules that drive essential processes in cells. To issue such specific sets of instructions, a section of DNA\u2014called a gene\u2014is first copied to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid ( or mRNA for short ) in a process called transcription. This process is tightly regulated in all living organisms so that only a subset of genes are actively transcribed at any time in a given cell. A group or \u2018complex\u2019 of proteins called TFIID plays an essential role in starting the transcription of genes that encode proteins in humans and other eukaryotic organisms. However, it is tricky to study how TFIID works because mutant cells that are missing individual components of the complex are unable to properly transcribe the required genes and soon die. Consequently, many studies of TFIID have used purified proteins in artificial systems where it is possible to examine particular aspects of TFIID activity in depth. Here, Zhang et al. used a combination of chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology techniques to identify a new molecule that can selectively bind to the TFIID complex. In an artificial system containing purified proteins and other molecules, this molecule \u2018locks\u2019 TFIID onto DNA and prevents a change in shape that is required for transcription to start. The experiments show that this rearrangement is only required to make the first mRNA copy of a gene because the molecule had no effect on initiating further rounds of transcription on the same DNA. Zhang et al. 's findings reveal that TFIID is very dynamic in controlling transcription, and that subsequent rounds of transcription follow a different path to make mRNAs. The next steps are to use new techniques such as single-molecule imaging to directly visualize the molecules involved in transcription, and to use the new molecule to block the start of transcription in living cells ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nComplex biological systems rely on cell surface cues that govern cellular self-recognition and selective interactions with appropriate partners. Molecular diversification of cell surface recognition molecules through DNA recombination and complex alternative splicing has emerged as an important principle for encoding such interactions. However, the lack of tools to specifically detect and quantify receptor protein isoforms is a major impediment to functional studies. We here developed a workflow for targeted mass spectrometry by selected reaction monitoring that permits quantitative assessment of highly diversified protein families. We apply this workflow to dissecting the molecular diversity of the neuronal neurexin receptors and uncover an alternative splicing-dependent recognition code for synaptic ligands.  The remarkable anatomical and functional complexity of nervous systems relies on molecular programs for cell intrinsic properties and selective cellular interactions. Major advances in transcriptomics have enabled the identification of gene regulatory programs and mRNA targets that underlie specification of neuronal cell types and their plasticity ( Hobert, 2011; Ebert and Greenberg, 2013; Molyneaux et al., 2015 ). For example, specific transcriptional programs direct the neurotransmitter phenotypes of neuronal populations, the targeting of axonal projections, or the modification of synapse numbers in response to neuronal activity. In addition, transcript-based studies have uncovered gene families with substantial molecular complexity that may encode neuronal recognition events ( Zipursky and Sanes, 2010; Schreiner et al., 2014a ). What remains a major challenge is the exploration of such molecular programs and their function at the protein level. mRNA and protein turnover rates as well as mRNA translation rates exhibit a significant dynamic range. Thus, transcript abundance cannot easily be extrapolated to provide quantitative assessments of the proteome or insights into the stoichiometry of protein complexes ( Helbig et al., 2011; Schwanhausser et al., 2011; Vogel and Marcotte, 2012 ). Notably, such post-transcriptional forms of gene regulation are particularly prevalent in the central nervous system highlighting the need for quantitative approaches that enable targeted dissection of the neuronal proteome. Additionally, many neurons possess long-distance projections. The localization of presynaptic proteins in many cases differs from the anatomical place of their mRNA expression. Thus, the possibility to detect and quantify isoforms at the protein level provides an important advantage in order to understand the functional role of these proteins. New developments in proteomics have driven major advances in understanding the cell biological mechanisms of neuronal development and connectivity ( Bayes and Grant, 2009; Craft et al., 2013 ). These led to the delineation of the composition of purified synaptic vesicles, postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor complexes, or models of presynaptic terminals ( Takamori et al., 2006; Shanks et al., 2012; Schwenk et al., 2014; Wilhelm et al., 2014 ). Most of these studies employed semi-quantitative \u2018shotgun\u2019 mass spectrometry approaches ( Liu et al., 2004; Venable et al., 2004; Neilson et al., 2011 ) that are based on the random sampling of peptide fragments detected in a sample. In this regard, the complexity of neuronal tissues and the molecular diversity of some neuronal receptor families pose significant limitations. First, many proteins are present in only a fraction of the cells or structures analyzed reducing the chance of detecting peptide levels required for adequate quantification. Second, over the past years alternative splicing has emerged as a key mechanism for the regulation of neuronal recognition ( Aoto et al., 2013; Takahashi and Craig, 2013; He et al., 2014; Iijima et al., 2014; Lah et al., 2014 ). Alternative splicing programs can generate families of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of closely related protein isoforms frequently distinguished by only a single peptide. Thus, when applying random sampling ( \u2018shotgun\u2019 ) approaches it is challenging to obtain sufficient coverage for isoform detection and quantification. Additionally, the protein inference problem, i. e., presence of the same peptide sequence in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms limits applicability of \u2018shotgun\u2019 approaches for detection and quantification of protein families with high sequence homologies ( Nesvizhskii and Aebersold, 2005 ). One possibility to circumvent these problems is the application of targeted proteomic approaches, such as selected reaction monitoring ( SRM; also referred to as MRM for \u2018multiple reaction monitoring\u2019 ). While originally developed for characterization of chemical compounds this method has recently emerged as promising technique for the quantitative analysis of protein species in biological samples ( Phanstiel et al., 2008; Picotti and Aebersold, 2012; Carr et al., 2014 ). Instead of sampling a random portion of the proteome, SRM assays use optimized separation and detection parameters for a set of pre-selected peptides ( termed proteotypic peptides or PTPs ) that are specific to a protein or isoform of interest. PTPs are detected based on their chromatographic retention time and mass to charge ratio ( rather than by sequencing as in shotgun proteomics ). For each PTP, an isotopically labeled reference peptide is added to the sample which then is used as standard for quantification. This strategy greatly reduces experimental variability and significantly increases sensitivity in the detection and quantification of selected peptides ( Bauer et al., 2014 ). To date, significant contributions in advancing our knowledge in biology have been made by applying SRM-based approaches, in particular to profile cellular pathways and metabolic states, thereby quantifying low abundance proteins within complex mixtures ( Picotti et al., 2013; Simicevic et al., 2013; Kennedy et al., 2014 ). SRM assays have also been applied successfully to detect and quantify neuronal proteins ( Zhang et al., 2012; Craft et al., 2013 ). However, the applicability for the dissection of highly diversified protein families in complex tissues remains to be explored. In this study, we developed an array of SRM-based assays for the detection and quantification of highly diversified neuronal receptors. As a case study we focused on neurexins, a class of synaptic adhesion molecules which are widely expressed in the CNS and play an important role in synapse formation and function ( Dean et al., 2003; Missler et al., 2003; Graf et al., 2004; Chih et al., 2006; Taniguchi et al., 2007; Uemura et al., 2010 ). In mammals, three neurexin genes ( Nrxn1, 2, 3 ) are transcribed from two alternative promoters giving rise to long alpha-neurexin and short beta-neurexin transcripts ( Reissner et al., 2013 ). Alternative splicing at six alternatively spliced segments ( AS1-6 ) generates >1000 unique isoforms which can be detected in the adult brain at the transcript level ( Baudouin and Scheiffele, 2010; Schreiner et al., 2014b ). Importantly, insertion or skipping of alternative exons at two of the alternatively spliced segments ( AS2 and AS4 ) was reported to regulate binding of neurexins to a number of different interaction partners ( Ichtchenko et al., 1995; Sugita et al., 2001; Chih et al., 2006; Koehnke et al., 2010; Siddiqui et al., 2010; Uemura et al., 2010; Reissner et al., 2013 ). This raises the possibility that neurexin molecular diversity\u2014and in particular its regulation by alternative splicing\u2014may serve synaptic recognition events that control neuronal wiring and function. The challenge with exploring isoform-specific functions is the lack of suitable tools to detect or quantify endogenous neurexin protein variants. Thus, even fundamental questions have remained unanswered: are neurexins abundant synaptic components ? What is the relative contribution of the individual neurexin isoforms ( NRX1, 2, 3 alpha and beta forms ) to the total neurexin repertoire ? Are proteins produced from all of the detected alternative transcripts, in particular transcripts encoding rare splice insertions ? And does alternative splicing at all sites modify receptor\u2013ligand interactions ? Lastly, any studies on selective receptor\u2013ligand interactions have relied on overexpressed or recombinant proteins as no assays are available to specifically probe or detect the endogenous protein isoforms. In this study, we developed, validated, and applied a targeted proteomics workflow for the analysis of neurexin protein variants in the mouse brain using SRM-based assays. We provide a detailed protein expression map of neurexin alternative splice insertions, their absolute quantification, and uncover novel alternative splicing-dependent regulation of neurexin\u2013ligand interactions. This workflow can be highly multiplexed and applied to virtually any protein family and tissue. Thus, it provides important new directions for the dissection of molecular diversity in cellular recognition and pathologies.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: To create a protein, a gene is first copied to form an RNA molecule that contains regions known as introns and exons. Splicing removes the introns and joins the exons together to form a molecule of \u2018messenger RNA\u2019, which is translated into a protein. Over the course of evolution, many groups\u2014or families\u2014of proteins have expanded and diversified their roles. One way in which this can occur is through a process known as alternative splicing, in which different exons can be included or excluded to generate the final messenger RNA. In this way, a single gene can produce a number of different proteins. These closely related proteins are known as isoforms. The brain contains billions of neurons that communicate with one another across connections known as synapses. A family of proteins called neurexins helps neurons to form these synapses. Humans have three neurexin genes, which undergo extensive alternative splicing to produce thousands of protein isoforms. However, it is not known whether all of these isoforms are produced in neurons, as existing experimental techniques were not sensitive enough to easily distinguish one isoform from another. A technique known as \u2018selected reaction monitoring\u2019 ( or SRM for short ) has recently emerged as a promising way to identify proteins. This allows proteins containing specific sequences to be separated out for analysis, in contrast to existing techniques that test randomly selected protein samples, which will result in most isoforms being missed. Schreiner, Simicevic et al. have now developed SRM further and show that this technique can detect the identity and amount of the neurexin isoforms present at synapses, including those that are only produced in very small quantities. Using SRM, Schreiner, Simicevic et al. demonstrate that neurexin isoforms differ in how they interact with synaptic receptors. Thus, alternative splicing of neurexins underlies a \u2018recognition code\u2019 at neuronal synapses. In the future, this newly developed SRM method could be used to investigate isoforms in other protein families and tissues, and so may prove valuable for understanding how a wide range of cellular recognition processes work ."}

Although mitochondria control energy metabolism and apoptosis, the origins and impact of cancer-associated mutations in mtDNA are unclear. In this study, we analyzed somatic alterations in mtDNA from 1675 tumors. We identified 1907 somatic substitutions, which exhibited dramatic replicative strand bias, predominantly C > T and A > G on the mitochondrial heavy strand. This strand-asymmetric signature differs from those found in nuclear cancer genomes but matches the inferred germline process shaping primate mtDNA sequence content. A number of mtDNA mutations showed considerable heterogeneity across tumor types. Missense mutations were selectively neutral and often gradually drifted towards homoplasmy over time. In contrast, mutations resulting in protein truncation undergo negative selection and were almost exclusively heteroplasmic. Our findings indicate that the endogenous mutational mechanism has far greater impact than any other external mutagens in mitochondria and is fundamentally linked to mtDNA replication.  All cancers result from somatic mutations in their genomes. Beyond the \u223c3200 Mb of nuclear genomic DNA, human cells have hundreds to thousands of mitochondria present in every cell, each carrying one or a few copies of the 16, 569 bp circular mitochondrial genomes ( Smeitink et al., 2001; Legros et al., 2004; Koppenol et al., 2011 ). In addition to their role in cellular energy balance through oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria are involved in many essential cellular functions including modulation of oxidation\u2013reduction status, contribution to cytosolic biosynthetic precursors, and initiation of apoptosis. Mitochondria in eukaryotic cells evolved by endosymbiosis from a free-living \u03b1-proteobacterium ( Gray et al., 1999 ). Over 2 billion years of co-evolution, many ancestral mitochondrial genes have transferred to the nucleus ( Falkenberg et al., 2007; Calvo and Mootha, 2010; Wallace, 2012 ). What remains in the mitochondrial genome is distinctive for the striking asymmetry between the two complementary mtDNA strands in terms of nucleotide content and gene distribution ( Andrews et al., 1999 ). The heavy ( H ) strand is guanine-rich ( C/G = 0. 4 ) and is the template from which most mitochondrial proteins ( 12 out of 13 ) are transcribed, whereas only one protein-coding gene, MT-ND6, is transcribed from the correspondingly cytosine-rich light ( L ) strand. Mutations in the mitochondrial genome cause inherited disease ( Chinnery, 1993 ), with a maternal inheritance pattern because only eggs contribute mitochondria to the zygote. The penetrance of inherited mitochondrial disease is determined stochastically by both the random assortment of mutated vs wild-type mitochondrial genomes during meiosis and random drift during the early cell divisions after fertilization. In cancer, the role of somatically acquired mtDNA mutations is controversial. Although cancer-specific mutations have been previously reported ( Polyak et al., 1998; Brandon et al., 2006; Chatterjee et al., 2006; He et al., 2010; Larman et al., 2012 ), the limited sample size or poor sensitivity of capillary sequencing for heteroplasmic mutations has not allowed a comprehensive analysis of the mutational signatures of mitochondrial mutations nor their likely functional significance. It has long been proposed that mitochondria might contribute to cancer development given their fundamental importance to cellular biology ( Wallace, 2012 ). Previous reports suggested that mitochondrial somatic mutations might be under positive selection and thus contribute to cancer development, but the small number of reported mutations renders this conclusion uncertain ( Brandon et al., 2006; Chatterjee et al., 2006; Larman et al., 2012; Schon et al., 2012 ). Nonetheless, the hypothesis of functionally relevant mitochondrial mutations is an appealing one because cancer cells have greatly increased energy demands over normal cells and demonstrate a switch from aerobic glycolysis in mitochondria to lactic acid fermentation in the cytosol ( the Warburg effect ) ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Koppenol et al., 2011 ). In each cell cycle, the replicating genome is at risk of de novo mutations, which can promote the development of cancer. These mutations may be generated by intrinsic cellular errors during DNA replication or repair or through exposure to mutagens, such as reactive oxygen species, tobacco smoke, and ultraviolet light ( Pleasance et al., 2010a, 2010b ). Recently, >20 mutational signatures operative in cancers have been identified in the nuclear genome ( Alexandrov et al., 2013 ). Whether any of these mutational processes also affect the mitochondrial genome has not been studied. Furthermore, whether there are mtDNA-specific mutational processes in somatic cells remain unclear, although the many unique features of mtDNA replication and repair, coupled with the high concentration of reactive oxygen species generated by the electron transport chain, could be associated with distinctive mutation signatures. In this study, we compare 1675 cancer and paired normal mtDNA sequences across 31 tumor types using massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies to obtain a systematic and unbiased catalog of somatic mitochondrial mutations. We find that mtDNA mutations are almost exclusively the product of a mutational process that is specific to mitochondria and probably linked to the unique mechanism of genome replication these organelles employ. We find no evidence for positive selection of mitochondrial mutations during oncogenesis, suggesting that they confer no clonal advantage on the nascent cancer cells.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The DNA in a cell's nucleus must be copied faithfully, and divided equally, when a cell divides to produce two new cells. Mistakes\u2014or mutations\u2014are sometimes made during the copying process, and mutations can also be introduced by exposing DNA to damaging agents known as mutagens, such as UV light or cigarette smoke. These mutations are then maintained in all of the descendants of the cell. Most of these mutations have no impact on the cell's characteristics ( \u2018passenger mutations\u2019 ). However, \u2018driver mutations\u2019 that allow cells to divide uncontrollably and spread to other body sites can lead to cancer. Mitochondria are cellular compartments that are responsible for generating the energy a cell needs to survive and are also responsible for initiating programmed cell death. Mitochondria contain their own DNA\u2014entirely separate from that in the nucleus of the cell\u2014that encodes the proteins most essential for energy production. Mitochondrial DNA molecules are frequently exposed to damaging molecules called reactive oxygen species that are produced by the mitochondria. Therefore, these reactive oxygen species have been thought to be one of the most important causes of mitochondrial DNA mutations. In addition, because cancer cells produce energy differently to normal cells, mutations in the mitochondrial DNA that change the ability of the mitochondria to produce energy have been conventionally thought to help normal cells to become cancerous. However, conclusive evidence for a link between cancer and mitochondrial DNA mutations is lacking. Ju et al. examined the mitochondrial DNA sequences taken from 1675 cancer biopsies from over thirty different types of cancer and compared these to normal tissue from the same patients. This revealed 1907 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA taken from the cancer cells. The pattern of the mutations suggests that the majority of the mutations are not introduced from reactive oxygen species, but from the errors the mitochondria themselves make in the process of duplicating their DNA when a cell divides. Unexpectedly, known mutagens, such as cigarette smoke or UV light, had a negligible effect on mitochondrial DNA mutations. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Ju et al. found no evidence that the mitochondrial DNA mutations help cancer to develop or spread. Instead, like passenger mutations found in the DNA in the cell nucleus, most mitochondrial genome mutations have no discernible effect. However, Ju et al. revealed that DNA mutations that damage normal mitochondrial activity are less likely to be maintained in cancer cells. Presumably, mitochondria containing these proteins produce less energy, and so a cell containing too many of these mutations will find it harder to survive. This shows that having enough correctly functioning mitochondria is essential for even cancer cells to thrive ."}

While there are many single-species studies and integrative reviews documenting this pattern, a data-intensive approach has not been used yet to determine the generality of this pattern. We assessed the strength and direction of the intraspecific relationship between temperature and individual mass for 952 bird and mammal species. For eighty-seven percent of species, temperature explained less than 10% of variation in mass, and for 79% of species the correlation was not statistically significant. These results suggest that Bergmann's rule is not general and temperature is not a dominant driver of biogeographic variation in mass. Further understanding of size variation will require integrating multiple processes that influence size. The lack of dominant temperature forcing weakens the justification for the hypothesis that global warming could result in widespread decreases in body size.  Bergmann's rule describes a negative relationship between body mass and temperature across space that is believed to be common in endothermic species ( Bergmann, 1847; Brown and Lee, 1969; Kendeigh, 1969; Freckleton et al., 2003; Carotenuto et al., 2015 ). Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this pattern ( Blackburn et al., 1999; Ashton, 2002; Watt et al., 2010 ) including the heat loss hypothesis, which argues that the higher surface area to volume ratio of smaller individuals results in improved heat dissipation in hot environments ( Bergmann, 1847 ). Though originally described for closely-related species ( i. e., interspecific; Blackburn et al., 1999 ), the majority of studies have focused on the intraspecific form of Bergmann's rule ( Rensch, 1938; Meiri, 2011 ) by assessing trends in individual size within a species ( Langvatn and Albon, 1986;\u00a0Yom-Tov and Geffen, 2006;\u00a0Gardner et al., 2009 ). Bergmann's rule has been questioned both empirically and mechanistically ( McNab, 1971; Geist, 1987; Huston and Wolverton, 2011; Teplitsky and Millien, 2014 ) but the common consensus from recent reviews is that the pattern is general ( Ashton et al., 2000;\u00a0Ashton, 2002;\u00a0Meiri and Dayan, 2003;\u00a0Watt and Salewski, 2011 ). It has recently been suggested that this negative relationship between mass and temperature could result in decreasing individual size across species in response to climate change ( Sheridan and Bickford, 2011 ) and that this may be a \u2018third universal response to warming\u2019 ( Gardner et al., 2011 ). The resulting shifts in size distributions could significantly alter ecological communities ( Brose et al., 2012 ), especially if the rate of size decrease varies among species ( Sheridan and Bickford, 2011 ). While there is limited empirical research on body size responses to changes in temperature through time ( but see Smith et al., 1995;\u00a0Caruso et al., 2014;\u00a0Teplitsky and Millien, 2014 ), the apparent generality of Bergmann's rule across space indicates the likelihood of a similar relationship in response to temperature change across time. The generality of Bergmann's rule is based on many individual studies that analyze empirical data on body size across an environmental gradient ( e. g., Langvatn and Albon, 1986; Barnett, 1977; Fuentes and Jaksic, 1979; Dayan et al., 1989; Sand et al., 1995 ) and reviews that compile and evaluate the results from these studies ( Ashton, 2002; Meiri and Dayan, 2003;\u00a0Watt et al., 2010 ). Most individual studies of Bergmann's rule are limited by: ( 1 ) analyzing only one or a few species ( e. g., Langvatn and Albon, 1986 ) ; ( 2 ) using small numbers of observations ( e. g., Fuentes and Jaksic, 1979 ) ; ( 3 ) only including data at the small scales typical of ecological studies ( e. g., Sand et al., 1995 ) ; ( 4 ) using latitude instead of directly assessing temperature ( e. g., Barnett, 1977 ) ; and ( 5 ) focusing on statistical significance instead of the strength of the relationship ( e. g., Dayan et al., 1989 ). The reviews tabulate the results of these individual studies and assess patterns in the direction and significance of relationships across species. Such aggregation of published results allows for a more general understanding of the pattern but, in addition to limitations of the underlying studies, the conclusions may be influenced by publication bias and selective reporting due to studies or individual analyses that do not support Bergmann's rule being published less frequently ( Koricheva et al., 2013 ). Previous analyses of publication bias in the context of Bergmann\u2019s rule have found no evidence for selective publication, which supports the idea that it is a general rule ( Ashton, 2002; Meiri et al., 2004 ). However, two of the most extensive studies of Bergmann\u2019s rule, which both used museum records to assess dozens of intraspecific Bergmann\u2019s rule relationships simultaneously, found that the majority of species did not exhibit significant positive relationships between latitude and size ( McNab, 1971; Meiri et al., 2004 ). As a result, understanding the generality of this ecophysiological rule and its potential implications for global change requires more extensive analysis. A data-intensive approach to analyzing Bergmann's rule, evaluating the pattern using large amounts of broad scale data, has the potential to overcome existing limitations in the literature and provide a new perspective on the generality of the intraspecific form of Bergmann's rule. Understanding the generality of the temperature-mass relationship has important implications for how size will respond to climate change. We use data from VertNet ( Constable et al., 2010 ), a large compilation of digitized museum records that contains over 700, 000 globally distributed individual-level size measures, to evaluate the intraspecific relationship between temperature and mass for 952 mammal and bird species. The usable data consist of 273, 901 individuals with an average of 288 individuals per species, with individuals of each species spanning an average of 75 years and 34 latitudinal degrees. This approach reduces or removes many of the limitations to previous approaches and the results suggest that Bergmann's rule is not a strong or general pattern.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Scientists have found that individual animals of the same species tend to be smaller in hotter environments and larger in cooler ones. They named this pattern \u201cBergmann\u2019s Rule\u201d to describe how temperature can influence the size of an animal. However, most studies of Bergmann\u2019s Rule have only looked at one or a few species at a time. Knowing how many species follow this rule is important because globally rising temperatures could cause lots of species to become smaller. Since the size of organisms affects how much food and space they need, this could disrupt natural systems around the world. To test if Bergmann\u2019s rule can be extended to many species, Riemer, Guralnick, and White assessed the relationship between temperature and body mass for 952 bird and mammal species. Contrary to Bergmann\u2019s Rule, the results showed that most of the species had similar sizes regardless of the temperature of their environment. Only about 140 species were smaller in hotter environments, and about 70 species were larger in hotter environments. This suggest that Bergmann\u2019s Rule does not apply to most species as expected. While most birds and mammals may not get bigger or smaller due to warming global temperatures, the few species that do change in size \u2013 and the species that interact with them \u2013 may be more likely to become endangered or extinct. If we can determine which animals are at risk, we can prioritize their conservation and design better plans for doing so. Losing even a single species disrupts our ecosystems, on which we rely for critical resources like food, building materials, and clean air ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nAdaptation is a key component of efficient coding in sensory neurons. However, it remains unclear how neurons can provide a stable representation of external stimuli given their history-dependent responses. Here we show that a stable representation is maintained if efficiency is optimized by a population of neurons rather than by neurons individually. We show that spike-frequency adaptation and E/I balanced recurrent connectivity emerge as solutions to a global cost-accuracy tradeoff. The network will redistribute sensory responses from highly excitable neurons to less excitable neurons as the cost of neural activity increases. This does not change the representation at the population level despite causing dynamic changes in individual neurons. By applying this framework to an orientation coding network, we reconcile neural and behavioral findings. Our approach underscores the common mechanisms behind the diversity of neural adaptation and its role in producing a reliable representation of the stimulus while minimizing metabolic cost.  The range of firing rates that a sensory neuron can maintain is limited by biophysical constraints and available metabolic resources. Yet, these same neurons represent sensory inputs whose strength varies by orders of magnitude. Seminal work by Barlow ( 1961 ) and Laughlin ( 1981 ) demonstrated that sensory neurons in early processing stages adapt their response threshold and gain to the range of inputs that they recently received. A particularly striking example of such gain modulation at the single cell level has been shown in the fly H1 neuron ( Brenner et al., 2000 ). Gain adaptation has been observed in other early sensory circuits ( Blakemore and Campbell, 1969; Fairhall et al., 2001; Solomon and Kohn, 2014; Wark et al., 2007 ), such as in the retina ( Kastner and Baccus, 2014 ), auditory hair cells ( Nagel and Doupe, 2006; Wen et al., 2009 ) and is also present in later sensory stages ( Adibi et al., 2013; Wainwright, 1999 ). Moreover, cortical neurons acquire this property during development ( Mease et al., 2013 ). The work of Laughlin and Barlow was instrumental in uncovering a principle of neural adaption as maximizing information transfer. However, the natural follow-up question concerns the decoding of such neural responses after they have been subject to adaptation. Indeed, such changes in neural gains may result in profound changes of the mapping of neural responses to stimuli in a history-dependent manner. This raises the issue of how such adapting responses are interpreted by downstream sensory areas ( Seri\u00e8s et al., 2009; Webster, 2011 ). One possibility, of course, is that downstream areas do not change their decoding strategy, thus introducing systematic biases in perception. This has been interpreted as the source of perceptual illusions such as the tilt after-effect or the waterfall illusion ( Barlow and Hill, 1963; Wainwright, 1999; Clifford, 2014; He and MacLeod, 2001; Schwartz et al., 2009 ). Such illusions are classically triggered by long presentations of particularly strong or repetitive stimuli ( Maffei et al., 1973 ). However, adaptation deeply affects neural responses even at short time scales or after only one repetition of the same stimulus ( Patterson et al., 2013 ). Adaptation could make it impossible to recognize a visual object independently of the stimuli presented previously. An example is given in Figure 1 where we present successive visual patterns to a population of randomly connected leaky integrate-and-fire ( LIF ) neurons. For simplicity and for the sake of illustration, the network takes a 7-dimensional time-varying input interpreted as a spatio-temporal sequence of digital numbers ( Figure 1b, top row ). An optimal linear decoder was trained to reconstruct the patterns from the spike counts during the presentation of the patterns. Not surprisingly, the decoder could reconstruct the patterns accurately, regardless of their place in the sequence ( Figure 1b, 2nd row ). We then tested the network in the presence of spike-based adaptation in the LIF neurons. Spike-based adaptation was induced by temporarily hyperpolarizing the neurons after each spike. The time scale of this adaptation was chosen to be long enough to cover several visual patterns. When subjected to this spike-time dependent adaptation, the responses became strongly history dependent, resulting in a highly inaccurate decoding ( Figure 1b, 3rd row ). This would suggest that activity in downstream areas and perceptual interpretations should be based not only on the current sensory responses, but also on the recent history of neural activity ( Fairhall et al., 2001; Borst et al., 2005 ). In this study, we show that this is not necessarily the case. Recurrent connections can be tuned such that spike-dependent adaptation will not impair the stability of the representation ( Figure 1b, bottom row ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Humans see, hear, feel, taste and smell the world as spiking electrical signals in the brain encoded by sensory neurons. Sensory neurons learn from experience to adjust their activity when exposed repeatedly to the same stimuli. A loud noise or that strange taste in your mouth might be alarming at first but soon sensory neurons dial down their response as the sensations become familiar, saving energy. This neural adaptation has been observed experimentally in individual cells, but it raises questions about how the brain deciphers signals from sensory neurons. How do downstream neurons learn whether the reduced activity from sensory neurons is a result of getting used to a feeling, or a signal encoding a weaker stimulus ? The energy saved through neural adaptation cannot come at the expense of sensing the world less accurately. Neural networks in our brain have evidently evolved to code information in a way that is both efficient and accurate, and computational neuroscientists want to know how. There has been great interest in reproducing neural networks for machine learning, but computer models have not yet captured the mechanisms of neural coding with the same eloquence as the brain. Gutierrez and Den\u00e8ve used computational models to test how networks of sensory neurons encode a sensible signal whilst adapting to new or repeated stimuli. The experiments showed that optimal neural networks are highly cooperative and share the load when encoding information. Individual neurons are more sensitive to certain stimuli but the information is encoded across the network so that if one neuron becomes fatigued, others receptive to the same stimuli can respond. In this way, the network is both responsive and reliable, producing a steady output which can be readily interpreted by downstream neurons. Exploring how stimuli are encoded in the brain, Gutierrez and Den\u00e8ve have shown that the activity of one neuron does not represent the whole picture of neural adaptation. The brain has evolved to adapt to continuous stimuli for efficiency at both the level of individual neurons and across balanced networks of interconnected neurons. It takes many neurons to accurately represent the world, but only as a network can the brain sustain a steady picture ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nTranscriptional control ensures genes are expressed in the right amounts at the correct times and locations. Understanding quantitatively how regulatory systems convert input signals to appropriate outputs remains a challenge. For the first time, we successfully model even skipped ( eve ) stripes 2 and 3+7 across the entire fly embryo at cellular resolution. A straightforward statistical relationship explains how transcription factor ( TF ) concentrations define eve\u2019s complex spatial expression, without the need for pairwise interactions or cross-regulatory dynamics. Simulating thousands of TF combinations, we recover known regulators and suggest new candidates. Finally, we accurately predict the intricate effects of perturbations including TF mutations and misexpression. Our approach imposes minimal assumptions about regulatory function; instead we infer underlying mechanisms from models that best fit the data, like the lack of TF-specific thresholds and the positional value of homotypic interactions. Our study provides a general and quantitative method for elucidating the regulation of diverse biological systems.  A detailed knowledge of transcriptional control will have profound consequences for our understanding of myriad biological processes, including development, homeostasis, and evolution of new phenotypes. To this end, through a combination of genomic, genetic, and molecular experiments, the field continues to accumulate considerable information documenting components of regulatory systems and regulator-target interactions ( Gerstein et al., 2010; The modENCODE Consortium, 2010; The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012 ). At present however, many of these descriptions are qualitative. A major goal going forward is to interpret these data in a quantitative manner ( Wilczynski and Furlong, 2010 ) : how do regulators and regulatory interactions convert input signals to the appropriate output expression pattern ? In general, answering these questions remains a significant challenge. The experiments needed to probe regulatory functions in detail are technically demanding; moreover, many systems involve multiple layers of control that cannot be investigated within a single experimental set-up. Theoretical models can help advance experimental investigations by providing a framework for deriving general principles and developing testable hypotheses ( Reeves et al., 2006; Tomlin and Axelrod, 2007; Lewis, 2008; Oates et al., 2009; Davidson, 2010 ). An effective model should be able to define and predict expression accurately by describing how and by how much regulators influence target gene expression ( Hasty et al., 2001; Segal and Widom, 2009 ). Transcription in animals is controlled by interaction among transcription factors ( TFs ), enhancers, core promoters, silencers, insulators, and chromatin structure ( Lemon and Tjian, 2000; Arnosti, 2003; Levine, 2010; Ohler and Wassarman, 2010; Dean, 2011 ). It is thought that core promoter elements and chromatin structure provide general competence for transcription at transcription start sites ( Lenhard et al., 2012 ), whereas more distant enhancers up-regulate expression of genes under specific conditions ( Bulger and Groudine, 2011; Ong and Corces, 2011 ). A single gene can be regulated by multiple enhancers, each directing a portion of the overall gene expression pattern in space and time. Enhancers operate by binding TFs, which in turn recruit regulatory co-factors and/or interact directly with the core promoter where RNA polymerase acts ( Spitz and Furlong, 2012 ). A comprehensive model of transcriptional regulation would therefore include many factors, such as regulatory DNA sequence, DNA conformation, TF concentrations and nucleosome position among others ( Segal and Widom, 2009 ). However, many of the parameters in such a model are currently impossible to measure. In the absence of such measurements, a partial yet predictive model based on available data is still valuable. Here, we propose models of transcriptional control that are highly predictive of target gene expression given only TF concentrations at cellular resolution. Our goal is to make few assumptions about the underlying molecular mechanism. Instead, by generating models that predict experimental measurements as accurately as possible, we infer probable biological mechanisms and insights suggested by the parameters of the models. To achieve this, we focus on modeling the functional link between TF inputs and the resulting output ( i. e., the \u2018regulatory input function\u2018 ). These models are specific to individual enhancers: they capture how genomic loci interpret TF concentrations to control the output expression level of their target genes. Though multiple previous modeling studies have explicitly included protein\u2013DNA interactions ( e. g., in Drosophila, see He et al., 2010; Janssens et al., 2006; Junion et al., 2012; Kazemian et al., 2010; Segal et al., 2008; Zinzen et al., 2009 ), here, we choose to model the relationship between inputs and outputs directly as this offers several advantages. First and most importantly, this type of model encapsulates numerous relevant levels of biophysical interactions ( i. e., TF-DNA, TF-TF, enhancer-promoter etc ). Second, it enables us evaluate the utility of higher-order interactions between TFs, propose potential regulators and consider alternative hypotheses of experimental results. Third, in the context of developmental biology, it allows us to explore the minimal information required to define positional information in the early embryo. Finally, focusing on input and output measurements means that the approach is applicable to relatively uncharacterized systems, for instance where enhancer regions have not yet been identified, or in assessing the conservation of regulatory input functions between species ( Wunderlich et al., 2012 ). We develop and test our models in the context of the well-studied even skipped ( eve ) enhancers in order to demonstrate their accuracy and utility. eve is expressed in a symmetrical pattern of seven stripes that subdivide the embryo along the anteroposterior axis ( N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980 ). Each stripe is only a few nuclei wide and any regulatory input function of an enhancer must define at least two borders at a high level of precision. A number of well-characterized enhancers direct expression of the seven eve stripes individually or in pairs ( Goto et al., 1989; Harding et al., 1989; Fujioka et al., 1999 ). Here, we focus on the enhancers eve 2 and eve 3+7, which have been shown to control stripe 2 and stripes 3 and 7 respectively ( Goto et al., 1989; Harding et al., 1989; Stanojevic et al., 1991; Small et al., 1992, 1996 ). Many of the input TFs and their roles in regulating eve expression have been defined; however, there remain unexplained properties underlying their regulation. An advantage of modeling eve is that we can use the available information as independent validations of our ability to recover known regulators and predict the outcome of regulatory perturbations, while also producing new insights. It is notable that though there has been some success in simulating the simpler gap gene expression pattern and in predicting eve expression on a portion of the anteroposterior axis, modeling pair-rule expression accurately across the whole embryo has remained a significant challenge ( Jaeger et al., 2004; Janssens et al., 2006; Papatsenko and Levine, 2008; Segal et al., 2008; Kazemian et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013 ). To fit regulatory input functions, we require accurate measurements of expression levels for both the regulating TFs and eve. The Virtual Embryo from the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project provides the best available data for this purpose ( Fowlkes et al., 2008 ). It is a cellular resolution, spatiotemporal atlas of gene expression and morphology for a whole Drosophila melanogaster blastoderm embryo. The dataset contains the three-dimensional coordinates for 6078 nuclei, along with mRNA expression measurements of 95 different genes at six time points during the 50 min leading to gastrulation: these genes include critical TFs that direct patterning in the early Drosophila embryo. Using our modeling framework, we ( i ) predict expression patterns with accuracy and explanatory power at cellular resolution across the whole embryo; ( ii ) recover previously described regulatory relationships and test whether they provide sufficient positional information to define the resulting expression pattern; ( iii ) propose potential new regulatory relationships by comparing alternative models; and ( iv ) predict expression patterns under perturbation of input TFs, capturing the outcome of knockdown and misexpression experiments. Given the high level of accuracy of our models, we conclude with observations regarding mechanism and principles of enhancer function.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The transcription of genes into messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules is one of the most important processes in biology, but our present understanding of this process is largely qualitative. Molecules such as transcription factors and regions of DNA other than the region that codes for the mRNA are known to interact with each other to influence the onset of transcription, and also the rate at which it occurs. However, given the cellular concentrations of transcription factors in a developing organism, it is not known if it is possible to accurately predict their effects on transcription. Being able to make such predictions would greatly improve our understanding of how transcription and the development of an organism are controlled. Ilsley et al. have tackled this problem by analysing a large volume of data called the Virtual Embryo dataset: produced by the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project, this dataset includes the results of mRNA expression measurements on 95 different genes at six different times during the early development of Drosophila melanogaster, a species of fruit fly. In particular, Ilsley et al. focussed on the expression at one point in time of the even skipped ( eve ) gene, a widely studied gene that is important for embryo development in these fruit flies. The eve gene is one of the genes responsible for dividing the fly into segments which form part of its body plan. Without making any assumptions about the biological mechanisms that might be involved, Ilsley et al. built a statistical model that was able to predict the pattern of gene expression for a fruit fly, given the concentrations of the relevant transcription factors in the various cells within the embryo as input. The model was also able to predict the patterns of gene expression observed in other experiments involving mutations and the misexpression of fruit fly genes. Moreover, Ilsley et al. have made various predictions involving the genes Bicoid and Hunchback that can be tested experimentally in future studies ."}

Here, we report on a new methodology which combines Structured Illumination Microscopy ( SIM ) with machine learning algorithms to image and classify the structure of large populations of biopharmaceutical viruses with high resolution. The method offers information on virus morphology that can ultimately be linked with functional performance. We demonstrate the approach on viruses produced for oncolytic viriotherapy ( Newcastle Disease Virus ) and vaccine development ( Influenza ). This unique tool enables the rapid assessment of the quality of viral production with high throughput obviating the need for traditional batch testing methods which are complex and time consuming. We show that our method also works on non-purified samples from pooled harvest fluids directly from the production line.  The potential of super-resolution microscopy ( SRM ) to unravel details of the structure and replication of viruses was recognised early on in the development of the methodology ( Betzig et al., 2006; M\u00fcller and Heilemann, 2013 ). Since then, SRM has been used to provide unprecedented insights into viral protein architecture ( Laine et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Gray et al., 2016; Albecka et al., 2016 ). Previous work has focused on those SRM techniques that achieve the highest theoretical resolution, such as Stimulated Emission Depletion ( STED ) ( Hell and Wichmann, 1994 ) and Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy ( SMLM ) ( Rust et al., 2006; Heilemann et al., 2008 ). Whilst offering high fidelity data, the downside is the associated long acquisition time required by these methods, limiting their application to the imaging of static samples at low throughput. A much faster technique, although inferior in spatial resolution, is Structured Illumination Microscopy ( SIM ) ( Gustafsson, 2000; Heintzmann and Cremer, 1999 ) and this has been applied to study large viruses such as the prototypic poxvirus ( Gray et al., 2016; Horsington et al., 2012 ). In addition to understanding the structure of viruses, there is also a\u00a0need to identify and analyse classes of structures within large viral populations, especially in the biotechnology industry where virus quality is often compromised by large scale production operations and the virus product is often characterised by significant morphological heterogeneities. In particular, campaigns of influenza immunization rely heavily on the timely and efficient production of specific virus strains. Similarly, a deeper understanding of the structural heterogeneity of oncolytic viruses such as Newcastle Disease Virus ( NDV ) ( Ganar et al., 2014; Lichty et al., 2014 ) would enable optimization of the production processes and in turn improve the development of viriotherapy. However, quantifying and understanding this structural heterogeneity and relating it to virus efficacy requires the imaging of large numbers of viruses at sufficient spatial resolution to reveal characteristic morphological details. Typically, this is achieved by extracting batches from the production process, with elaborate subsequent purification and preparation steps before characterisation by Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM ) ( Gad, 2007; Goldsmith and Miller, 2009; Brenner and Horne, 1959 ). Although TEM can achieve relatively high imaging throughput if the highest resolution is not necessary, its contrast remains unspecific and therefore does not typically\u00a0permit discerning the presence of particular proteins in the virus envelope. Also, the typical signal-to-noise ratios achieved by TEM\u00a0are not sufficient to permit automated, robust and efficient downstream analysis of structural features at the single particle level. It is therefore challenging for TEM to be of practical use during production operations. Here, we demonstrate that rapid high resolution imaging with Total Internal Reflection SIM fluorescence microscopy ( TIRF-SIM ) ( Shao et al., 2011; Kner et al., 2009; Young et al., 2016 ), combined with a machine learning ( ML ) approach to analyse and classify structures in virus batches offer a great opportunity to circumvent these problems. We present MiLeSIM ( Machine Learning Structured Illumination Microscopy ) as an efficient combination of SRM, ML-based classification ( Van Valen et al., 2016; Sommer et al., 2011 ) and advanced image analysis for the quantification of morphological heterogeneities in large virus populations. We use ML algorithms to perform a classification of super-resolved images of a heterogeneous virus population into particle classes with distinct and characteristic structural features ( e. g. spherical, filamentous ). The classified subpopulations are then further analysed through image analysis pipelines that are specifically adapted for each structural class. We and others have shown that appropriate model fitting can lead to precision in structural parameters beyond the resolution of the images used ( Laine et al., 2015; Manetsberger et al., 2015 ). The method combines speed and specificity and allows an in-depth exploration of large virus populations that is unachievable by TEM. The method has potentials in the industrial production of viruses, for\u00a0example for oncolytic viriotherapy and vaccine development. First, we compare TIRF-SIM with alternative imaging modalities and show that it is the method of choice to investigate virus structure at high-throughput ( ~220 virus particles/s, see Supplementary Note 1 ) with a spatial resolution reaching\u00a0~90 nm. The large datasets obtained with TIRF-SIM are then fed into an ML algorithm for the automated classification of Newcastle Disease Virus ( NDV ) and live attenuated influenza virus ( LAIV ) vaccines, enabling further shape-specific quantitative analyses for a structural description of viral subpopulations. The purpose of our study is to validate the MiLeSIM approach as a powerful analysis tool for biotechnological processes involving virus production both in industry and in the research laboratory.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Viruses are like the Trojan horses of the biological world; they sneak their genetic code into a living cell and then hijack it, forcing that cell to produce their own viral proteins. Yet, if scientists replace the harmful genes in a virus with other genes, the virus can be transformed into a powerful tool for biology and medical science. For example, viruses can be turned into vaccines that prime the immune system to ward off future infections. Viruses could also be made to deliver the genetic code needed to repair faulty cells, and thus treat the cause of an illness from inside the body. Nevertheless, it is complicated to produce viruses like these on a large scale. The individual viruses in one batch can be very different shapes and sizes; they can also end up displaying different proteins on their outer surface \u2013 which is the part of the virus that our immune system will see first. To optimise the production of standardised viruses, scientists need a way to test the viruses throughout the manufacture process. At the moment, the best way to do this would be with electron microscopes. Yet these microscopes cannot tell exactly which proteins are in the outer surface of the virus. Also, these methods often need purified samples of virus, so cannot be used to look at the viruses until the final stage of production. Laine et al. now report a method that can test virus production at every step of the process. This new method uses a different type of microscopy called super-resolution imaging, which is quicker than electron microscopy and more able to deal with impurities, but can still see objects that are 500 times smaller than the width of a human hair. First, Laine et al. took pictures of many viruses with this new imaging technique, sorted the images into groups based on their appearance, and then trained computer algorithms with the pre-sorted groups ( a technique called \u201csupervised learning\u201d ). Next, the trained algorithms were shown new images of viruses and asked to classify them. The algorithms could separate images of a mixed population of viruses into six groups according to their shape and size, and then analyse each group in a specific way. For example, they would measure and report the length of filament-shaped viruses, the radius of spherical viruses and the length and width of rod-shaped viruses. The first set of test images were of Newcastle Disease Virus, which is currently under development as a treatment for cancer. But further testing revealed that the algorithm also works for the influenza virus, which is used to make flu vaccines. The algorithm could classify the viruses in pure and impure samples, and the imaging technique could handle over 200 viruses each second. This approach of combining super-resolution imaging with artificial intelligence could help scientists to understand what makes good vaccines and how best to optimise the production of viruses for medical purposes. It could also allow researchers to respond more rapidly to outbreaks of viral infections. The next step is to build this work into a system that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nPhotoreceptors are the most numerous and metabolically demanding cells in the retina. Their primary nutrient source is the choriocapillaris, and both the choriocapillaris and photoreceptors require trophic and functional support from retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells. Defects in RPE, photoreceptors, and the choriocapillaris are characteristic of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ), a common vision-threatening disease. RPE dysfunction or death is a primary event in AMD, but the combination ( s ) of cellular stresses that affect the function and survival of RPE are incompletely understood. Here, using mouse models in which hypoxia can be genetically triggered in RPE, we show that hypoxia-induced metabolic stress alone leads to photoreceptor atrophy. Glucose and lipid metabolism are radically altered in hypoxic RPE cells; these changes impact nutrient availability for the sensory retina and promote progressive photoreceptor degeneration. Understanding the molecular pathways that control these responses may provide important clues about AMD pathogenesis and inform future therapies.  Uninterrupted blood flow and an intricate and architecturally optimized network of photoreceptors, interneurons, glia, and epithelial cells are required for vision. The primary blood supply for photoreceptors is the choriocapillaris, an extraretinal fenestrated capillary bed. A layer of extracellular matrix proteins, Bruch\u2019s membrane, lies adjacent to the choriocapillaris, and a monolayer of retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells divides Bruch\u2019s membrane from the photoreceptors. The choriocapillaris, Bruch\u2019s membrane, RPE, and photoreceptors function as one unit, with the choriocapillaris providing fuel for phototransduction, and Bruch\u2019s membrane and RPE cells filtering and regulating the reciprocal exchange of oxygen, nutrients, biomolecules, and metabolic waste products between the circulation and retina. RPE also provide critical support for both photoreceptors and the choriocapillaris ( Strauss, 2005 ) in large part by generating vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ), a cytokine required for choriocapillaris development and maintenance ( Kurihara et al., 2012; Le et al., 2010; Marneros et al., 2005; Saint-Geniez et al., 2009 ). Defects in this unit, including reduced choriocapillaris density, the presence of sub-RPE lipid-rich deposits, and RPE/photoreceptor dysfunction, are characteristic of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ), a common vision-threatening disease whose prevalence is steadily increasing globally ( Friedman et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2014 ). Several genetic and lifestyle risk factors have been identified but no cure exists ( Bird, 2010 ). While current evidence suggests that AMD is a spectrum of closely related multifactorial polygenic diseases ( Bird et al., 2014 ), 10 year clinic-based data from the Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study ( AREDS; n\u00a0=\u00a04757 ) showed that the major risk factors include aging, severity of drusen ( sub-RPE deposits ), and RPE abnormalities ( Chew et al., 2014 ). Early AMD is characterized by pigmentary changes and appearance of drusen ( Gass, 1973; Pauleikhoff et al., 1990; Sarks, 1976; Wang et al., 2010 ). In most cases early AMD proceeds towards geographic atrophy ( or 'dry' AMD ), a condition defined by focal photoreceptor, RPE, and choriocapillaris loss and thickening of Bruch\u2019s membrane with immunomodulatory proteins and lipids ( Bird, 2010; Jager et al., 2008; Zarbin, 1998 ). While the primary defect could occur in Bruch\u2019s membrane ( Pauleikhoff et al., 1990; Bressler et al., 1990; Mullins et al., 2011 ), the choriocapillaris ( Ramrattan et al., 1994; Spraul et al., 1996; Spraul et al., 1999 ), or photoreceptors ( Sarks, 1976; Hogan, 1972; Sarks et al., 1988 ), most evidence suggests that it probably occurs in RPE cells. Granules enriched with lipid-rich residues, lipofuscin, accumulate normally in aging RPE cells ( Bazan et al., 1990 ), but abnormal accretions are observed in patients with geographic atrophy in a band directly surrounding the lesion ( Feeney-Burns et al., 1984; Holz et al., 1999; von Ruckmann et al., 1997 ). Lipofuscin renders the RPE more sensitive to blue light-induced damage ( Rozanowska et al., 1995; Schutt et al., 2000; Sparrow et al., 2000 ), impairs RPE functions ( Holz et al., 1999; Finnemann et al., 2002; Lakkaraju et al., 2007; Sparrow et al., 1999 ), and is potentially toxic for RPE cells ( Schutt et al., 2000 ). The downstream effects of RPE loss are catastrophic, and result in choriocapillaris attenuation and photoreceptor degeneration in late stage AMD patients ( Bhutto and Lutty, 2012; Coscas et al., 2014; Jonas et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2013; Sohrab et al., 2012; McLeod et al., 2009 ). Assuming, therefore, that the critical event of AMD pathogenesis occurs in RPE cells, how can the onset of the other early clinical manifestations of the disease in neighboring cells and structures be explained ? There is a growing body of evidence that choroidal and retinal blood flow is reduced in AMD ( Boltz et al., 2010; Remsch et al., 2000 ). We hypothesize that hypoxia, a natural consequence of aging microenvironments ( that is exacerbated by obesity and smoking ) ( Blasiak et al., 2014; Chiu and Taylor, 2011; Morgado et al., 1994; Sagone et al., 1973 ), in RPE cells may be a central AMD risk factor based on the following lines of evidence: ( a ) RPE provide critical vasculotrophic support required for photoreceptor function ( Kurihara et al., 2012 ) ; ( b ) Hypoxia alters lipid handling in other cell-types ( Glunde et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2012; Semenza, 2009 ) ; ( c ) at least 40% of lipids in drusen are secreted by RPE ( Cao et al., 2013 ) ; ( d ) the RPE secretome is sensitive to stress ( Wang et al., 2010 ) ; and ( e ) in drusen rich zones of AMD patient eyes, vascular density is significantly reduced ( Mullins et al., 2011 ). Therefore, hypoxia-mediated changes to the RPE lipidome and secretome could enhance lipofuscin accumulation and induce Bruch\u2019s Membrane lipidization and thickening, thereby exacerbating RPE dysfunction, choriocapillaris drop-out, and photoreceptor dysfunction. This vicious cycle of events could accelerate progression of AMD. Hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits ( HIF-\u03b1s ) are the key transcription factors that mediate responses to hypoxia. Under normal conditions HIF-\u03b1s are constitutively expressed and targeted by von Hippel-Lindau protein ( VHL ) for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. VHL is inactivated at low oxygen tensions; this allows HIF-\u03b1s to translocate to the nucleus and activate a host of angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, erythropoiesis, and inflammation genes ( Semenza, 2011 ). In this study we directly or indirectly hyperactivated HIF-\u03b1s in RPE by genetically perturbing components of the VHL/HIF/VEGF pathway using inducible and conditional gene ablation techniques. These manipulations altered lipid handling and glucose consumption of RPE cells, induced gross morphometric changes in RPE, reduced nutrient availability for the sensory retina, and promoted progressive photoreceptor atrophy. Understanding the effects of hypoxia on RPE metabolism, and learning how to control these effects, may provide insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies to treat retinal degenerative diseases.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells use a sugar called glucose as fuel to provide energy for many essential processes. The light-sensing cells in the eye, known as photoreceptors, need tremendous amounts of glucose, which they receive from the blood with the help of neighboring cells called retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells. Without a reliable supply of this sugar, the photoreceptors die and vision is lost. As we age, we are at greater risk of vision loss because RPE cells become less efficient at transporting glucose and our blood vessels shrink so that the photoreceptors may become starved of glucose. To prevent age-related vision loss, we need new strategies to keep blood vessels and RPE cells healthy. However, it was not clear exactly how RPE cells supply photoreceptors with glucose, and what happens when blood supplies are reduced. To address this question, Kurihara, Westenskow et al. used genetically modified mice to investigate how cells in the eye respond to starvation. The experiments show that when nutrients are scarce the RPE cells essentially panic, radically change their diet, and become greedy. That is to say that they double in size and begin burning fuel faster while also stockpiling extra sugar and fat for later use. In turn, the photoreceptors don\u2019t get the energy they need and so they slowly stop working and die. Kurihara, Westenskow et al. also show that there is a rapid change in the way in which sugar and fat are processed in the eye during starvation. Learning how to prevent these changes in patients with age-related vision loss could protect their photoreceptors from starvation and death. The next step following on from this research is to design drugs to improve the supply of glucose and nutrients to the photoreceptors by repairing aging blood vessels and/or preventing RPE cells from stockpiling glucose for themselves ."}

CAMSAP homologs associate with microtubule minus-ends, and are important for the stability of epithelial cell adhesions. In this study, we report morphological defects in neurons and neuromuscular defects in mutants of the C. elegans CAMSAP, ptrn-1. Mechanosensory neurons initially extend wild-type neurites, and subsequently remodel by overextending neurites and retracting synaptic branches and presynaptic varicosities. This neuronal remodeling can be activated by mutations known to alter microtubules, and depends on a functioning DLK-1 MAP kinase pathway. We found that PTRN-1 localizes to both neurites and synapses, and our results suggest that alterations of microtubule structures caused by loss of PTRN-1 function activates a remodeling program leading to changes in neurite morphology. We propose a model whereby minus-end microtubule stabilization mediated by a functional PTRN-1 is necessary for morphological maintenance of neurons.  In animals, stable neuronal morphology is necessary to maintain synaptic architecture. However, morphological alterations are also critical for plastic changes in synaptic strength, pruning of synaptic connections, and occasional responses to injury or other cues. Morphological reorganization of neurons is known to occur as a compensatory mechanism in cases of sight or hearing deprivation ( Karlen et al., 2006; Barone et al., 2013 ), and medium spiny neurons are reported to experience reversible morphology changes in response to mild stress ( Bessa et al., 2013 ). Neurons in D. melanogaster and C. elegans, as well as many mammalian peripheral neurons respond to injuries by remodeling their morphology including the growth of neurites, elimination of existing synapses, and establishment of new synapses ( Hilliard, 2009 ). The study of neuronal remodeling after injury in model organisms has elucidated cellular pathways responsible for morphological changes, however, little is known about the molecular cues that initiate these cascades. The conserved mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase kinase kinase DLK-1 functions to transmit regenerative signals in C. elegans, and is a component of regenerative signaling in organisms with more complex nervous systems ( Hammarlund et al., 2009; Xiong et al., 2010; Shin et al., 2012 ). While there is a wealth of information about conserved down-stream signals affected by DLK-1 activity, very little information exits about how DLK-1 itself is activated ( Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013 ). Recently, calcium spikes were shown to activate C. elegans DLK-1, but fly and mammalian homologs lack this calcium-binding domain ( Yan and Jin, 2012 ). It is known that the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 ( PHR, PAM, HIGHWIRE ) keeps levels of DLK-1 low ( Nakata et al., 2005; Xiong et al., 2010 ). Axonal injury is reported to cause microtubule disassembly and disorganization of higher-order microtubule structures ( Erturk et al., 2007 ). Microtubule depolymerization was recently found to activate DLK-1 signaling. However, this study did not investigate in what context ( development, regeneration, or degeneration ) this microtubule-based mechanism might be functioning ( Bounoutas et al., 2011 ). Neurons contain both very stable and dynamic microtubule structures. These populations are maintained by the activities of cytoskeletal-associated proteins and by post-translational modifications ( Conde and Caceres, 2009 ). Proteins known to be involved in stabilizing and organizing microtubule structures include molecular motors, and cross-linkers, as well as microtubule nucleating and severing proteins, and proteins involved in regulating plus-end dynamics ( reviewed in Subramanian and Kapoor, 2012 ). Post-translational modifications to microtubules include acetylation, tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation, and phosphorylation. These modifications affect the recruitment of microtubule-associated proteins and denote subcellular populations of microtubule structures such as the tyrosinated microtubules of dynamic growth cones or the acetylated microtubules of stable neurites ( Baas and Black, 1990; Brown et al., 1993; Janke and Bulinski, 2011; Garnham and Roll-Mecak, 2012 ). In C. elegans, microtubule acetylation mutants display short microtubules, alterations in microtubule protofilament number, and association of filaments into higher-order structures ( Cueva et al., 2012; Topalidou et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, microtubule de-acetylation was recently shown to be an early signal for the development of growth-cones in neuronal remodeling associated with regeneration ( Cho and Cavalli, 2012 ). It is currently unclear how destabilizing modifications or depolymerization of microtubule structures could activate neuronal remodeling. Depolymerization events that occur in dynamic microtubule populations clearly do not cause neurite remodeling in healthy neurons, so it is not likely that depolymerization itself or free microtubule monomers are the remodeling signal. One possibility is that the normally stable minus-ends of microtubules initiate remodeling signals. In this study, we report that genetic lesions in ptrn-1, the C. elegans homolog of the microtubule minus-end binding calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated ( CAMSAP ) family cause neurite remodeling including overextension of neurites and retraction of collateral presynaptic varicosities and branches. These remodeling events require DLK-1, a known player in morphology changes associated with degenerative and regenerative signaling in neurons. This is the first report of a CAMSAP family member being involved in remodeling of neurite morphology. Members of the CAMSAP family are known to associate with microtubule minus ends and stabilize microtubule structures ( Goshima et al., 2007; Meng et al., 2008; Baines et al., 2009; Goodwin and Vale, 2010; Tanaka et al., 2012 ). CAMSAPs are found in mammalian neuronal tissue ( Baines et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2009 ), and genetic variants of human CAMSAP1L1 were recently shown to confer susceptibility to epilepsy ( Guo et al., 2012 ). Thus understanding the neuronal consequences of disruptions to CAMSAP function may begin to inform our understanding of disease mechanisms. We found that disruptions in ptrn-1 cause alterations to neuronal morphology, and these changes occur via a DLK-1 neuronal remodeling program. We were able to mimic and enhance ptrn-1 loss-of-function phenotypes with genetic and pharmacological alterations of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Furthermore, mutation of dlk-1 suppressed a microtubule acetylation mutant supporting the idea that altering microtubule structures is an upstream signal for DLK-1 activation. PTRN-1 is present in neurites and at sites of synaptic connectivity, suggesting local microtubule minus-end regulation may affect these mechanisms. In addition to identifying a novel function for CAMSAPs in the maintenance of neuron morphology, our results suggest that alterations to microtubule structures caused by loss of CAMSAP function activates a neuronal remodeling program. We propose a model whereby local minus-end microtubule stabilization mediated by CAMSAPs is necessary for the stabilization of mature neurite morphology.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Microtubules are tiny tubular structures made from many copies of proteins called tubulins. Microtubules have a number of important roles inside cells: they are part of the cytoskeleton that provides structural support for the cell; they help to pull chromosomes apart during cell division; and they guide the trafficking of proteins and molecules around inside the cell. Most microtubules are relatively unstable, undergoing continuous dis-assembly and re-assembly in response to the needs of the cell. The microtubules in the branches of nerve cells are an exception, remaining relatively stable over time. Now Marcette et al. and, independently, Richardson et al., have shown that a protein called PTRN-1 has an important role in stabilizing the microtubules in the nerve cells of nematode worms. Marcette et al. became interested in the PTRN-1 protein after conducting a screen of randomly mutated worms to look for those with abnormally developed nerve cells. Although worms with a mutation in the gene encoding the PTRN-1 protein could form nerve cells that looked normal during early development, the pattern of branches on the nerve cells went awry later on. Moreover, the mutant worms lost the swellings that are normally found at the junctions between nerve cells, and they also moved their bodies in an odd way. Engineering the mutant worms to produce the PTRN-1 protein in their nerve cells, but nowhere else, restored normal movement, and experiments with fluorescently tagged PTRN-1 proteins revealed that they are found on the microtubules within the nerve cells. Marcette et al. suggest that the microtubules become less stable when this protein is not present, and that this switches on a repair mechanism that remodels the nerve cells, providing that the active form of a protein called DLK-1 is present. Other mutations that reduce the stability of microtubules also triggered the same remodeling process. Future work will be necessary to uncover exactly what triggers the remodeling process, and to identify the other proteins that are involved in repairing the nerve cells ."}

However, a major challenge is the identification of therapeutically potent microbial consortia that colonize the host effectively while maximizing immunologic outcome. Here, we propose a novel workflow to select optimal immune-inducing consortia from microbiome compositicon and immune effectors measurements. Using published and newly generated microbial and regulatory T-cell ( Treg ) data from germ-free mice, we estimate the contributions of twelve Clostridia strains with known immune-modulating effect to Treg induction. Combining this with a longitudinal data-constrained ecological model, we predict the ability of every attainable and ecologically stable subconsortium in promoting Treg activation and rank them by the Treg Induction Score ( TrIS ). Experimental validation of selected consortia indicates a strong and statistically significant correlation between predicted TrIS and measured Treg. We argue that computational indexes, such as the TrIS, are valuable tools for the systematic selection of immune-modulating bacteriotherapeutics.  The intestinal microbiota has been shown to critically influence a multitude of host physiological functions, often through modulation of the immune system ( Gevers et al., 2014; Paun et al., 2016 ). Evidence includes studies in germ-free mice, which show that both pro-inflammatory T-helper 17 ( Th17 ) cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T-cells ( Treg ) are reduced in numbers in the intestinal lamina propria relative to conventional or specific pathogen-free mice ( Atarashi et al., 2008 ), and that repopulation with specific bacteria can reconstitute them ( Atarashi et al., 2015; Ivanov et al., 2009 ). One route to how the microbiota influences immune system activation is by the production of small molecules ( Donia and Fischbach, 2015 ). Microbially produced short-chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) were shown to facilitate extrathymic differentiation of immune system modulatory Treg ( Arpaia et al., 2013; Atarashi et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013 ) and are implicated in Treg-dependent anti-inflammatory properties of a mix of 17 human-derived Clostridia\u00a0strains ( Atarashi et al., 2013; Tanoue et al., 2016 ). Interestingly, individual Clostridia strains only have a modest effect on Treg induction \u2013 optimal induction relies on the synergistic interplay of several strains ( Atarashi et al., 2013; Belkaid and Hand, 2014 ). Because of these properties, there is currently great interest in the manipulation of this community for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic diseases ( Honda and Littman, 2012; Olle, 2013; Vieira et al., 2016 ). Efforts involving transplantation of bacteria from healthy humans to humans with C. difficile infections or with metabolic diseases have provided evidence that microbiota repopulation could be used as possible strategy for disease prevention and treatment ( van Nood et al., 2013; Vrieze et al., 2012 ). For this reason, intestinal supplementation of defined compositions of gut bacteria to treat a range of diseases is currently being pursued by multiple bio-pharmaceutical companies ( Garber, 2015 ). Determining what microbial consortia can colonize the host and stably coexist with an already resident microbial community, while inducing the desired immune response, is still a major challenge that hinders the translation of these efforts into the clinic ( Maldonado-G\u00f3mez et al., 2016; Weil and Hohmann, 2015 ). In previous work, some\u00a0of\u00a0us identified a set of 17 potent\u00a0Treg-inducing\u00a0Clostridia strains to select candidate\u00a0subsets\u00a0from ( Atarashi et al., 2013 ). The\u00a0determination of maximally immune-phenotype inducing combinations from these 17 strains is, however, experimentally infeasible as it would require the testing of 217\u20131\u00a0=\u00a0131071 possible subsets\u00a0in mice ( Faith et al., 2014 ). Therefore, a computational approach to prioritize which subsets to validate experimentally would have great utility. To our knowledge, to date there has been no model that allows for the simultaneous prediction of the dynamics of both the microbiota and the host immune response. Building on the approach to select for optimal bacterial combinations from ( Faith et al., 2014 ) and other efforts aimed at identifying potential immune-modulating microbes ( Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017; Schirmer et al., 2016 ), we overcome this problem by proposing a mathematical modeling-based framework that, by resolving microbiome\u2013immune system interactions with parameters constrained to experimental observations of microbiome and immune effectors, allows computational optimization of immune-stimulating bacterial combinations. To achieve this, we use a series of logically connected analyses that capture CD4+FOXP3+ Treg accumulation in the colonic lamina propria ( Omenetti and Pizarro, 2015; Round and Mazmanian, 2010 ) in response to the dynamics of human-derived Clostridia strains in germ-free mice, which had previously\u00a0been\u00a0shown to potently induce Treg expansion ( Atarashi et al., 2013 ) ( Figure 1 ). To constrain this proposed model framework to experimental data, we combine previously published ( Atarashi et al., 2013 ) and newly generated fluorescence-activated cell scanning ( FACS ) data with simulated and newly generated time-series colonization data from germ-free mice ( Figure 2A ). Subsequently, by applying a microbiome\u2013Treg mathematical model to this combined data set, we infer each strain\u2019s individual contribution to the CD4+FOXP3+ Treg pool ( Figure 2B ) and obtain an estimate of every possible\u00a0consortium\u2019s Treg induction potential. To justify the usage of predicted mono-colonization concentrations from a previously developed microbiome ecological model ( Bucci et al., 2016 ), we validate its ability in predicting temporal dynamics in response to different subsets of Treg-inducing strains ( Figure 3A ) and quantify the deviation of data and predictions ( Figure 3B ). Introduction of the TrIS, which assigns a score to every predicted steady-state microbial composition, enables us to identify combinations that robustly maximize Treg induction ( Figure 4A ). We analyze the relationship of TrIS and biomass ( Figure 4B ) as well as metabolic features of the consortia ( Figure 4C and D ). Most importantly, we\u00a0demonstrate the utility of our approach in predicting the potency of selected microbial combinations by validating the Treg induction and colonization ability of model-predicted strong, intermediate and weak Treg-inducing consortia in vivo ( Figure 4E ). We envision that our framework, while in this study tailored to finding combinations ameliorating auto-inflammatory conditions, may also have direct relevance to other immune-system enhancing applications such as the optimal delivery of probiotic-based cancer immunotherapies ( Garrett, 2015 ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The role of the immune system is to protect the body from infection. It does this by using a powerful toolkit that isolates pathogens and removes damaged tissue. When directed against bacteria and viruses, the system helps to keep the body safe, but an imbalance of the components of the immune system can lead to inflammatory or allergic diseases. The body has built-in mechanisms to shut off the immune response. For example, regulatory T-cells are immune cells with an anti-inflammatory effect, meaning they can switch off inflammation after the immune system has cleared an invasion. If their numbers are too low, it can contribute to unwanted inflammation. In ulcerative colitis, for instance, an unbalanced immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. This causes inflammation and ulcers in the intestine, resulting in bleeding and weight loss. Previous studies revealed that bacteria in the gut might help to control regulatory T-cell numbers. Certain combinations of bacteria can stimulate these regulatory T-cells and potentially dampen inflammation. Tweaking the different populations of microbes in the gut could provide a new way to treat diseases like ulcerative colitis. But, identifying the best combination to use is a major challenge. Testing them all one by one would be extremely challenging. Now, Stein, Tanoue et al. present a mathematical model designed to predict the best microbe-mix to use. The model incorporated data from regulatory T-cells and microbes gathered from mice to estimate the contribution that different strains of bacteria make to regulatory T-cell numbers. This then fed into an ecological model predicted how different combinations of bacteria would behave in mice. The model aimed to fulfill two key criteria. First, to find combinations that can form stable, long-term bacterial colonies alone and when faced with competing microbes. Second, to boost regulatory T-cell numbers, helping them to expand to correct the immune imbalance. To test the predictions, mice received combinations of bacteria suggested by the model. The model had predicted some combinations to be 'weak' at inducing regulatory T-cells, some 'intermediate' and some 'strong'. The results matched the predictions, validating the method. This new model allows the rapid design of microbes that could dampen the immune response in the gut and paves the way for new treatments to correct imbalances of the immune system. By using already available data, it should be possible to expand the model to other diseases with imbalance in the immune system. In future, similar models could also find combinations for other medical uses. For example, to optimise the delivery of cancer immunotherapy, or to modulate the immune system after an organ transplant ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nIn everyday social environments, demands on attentional resources dynamically shift to balance our attention to targets of interest while alerting us to important objects in our surrounds. The current study uses electroencephalography to explore how the push-pull interaction between top-down and bottom-up attention manifests itself in dynamic auditory scenes. Using natural soundscapes as distractors while subjects attend to a controlled rhythmic sound sequence, we find that salient events in background scenes significantly suppress phase-locking and gamma responses to the attended sequence, countering enhancement effects observed for attended targets. In line with a hypothesis of limited attentional resources, the modulation of neural activity by bottom-up attention is graded by degree of salience of ambient events. The study also provides insights into the interplay between endogenous and exogenous attention during natural soundscapes, with both forms of attention engaging a common fronto-parietal network at different time lags.  Attention is a selection mechanism that deploys our limited neural resources to the most relevant stimuli in the environment. Without such a\u00a0process, the sights and sounds of everyday life would overwhelm our senses. Filtering out important information from our surroundings puts a constant demand on the cognitive system given the dynamic nature of everyday scenes. On the one hand, we attend to sounds, sights and smells that we choose based on what matches our behavioral goals and contextual expectations. At the same time, we have to balance perception of salient events and objects that we need to be alerted to both for survival as well as awareness of our ever changing surrounds. These various factors guide our attentional resources to dynamically shift in order to shape the representation of sensory information based on its behavioral relevance, and ultimately influence how we perceive the world around us. How does the brain manage its executive attentional resources faced with these dynamic demands ? Studies of voluntary ( \u2018top-down\u2019 or endogenous ) attention have shown that cognitive feedback modulates the encoding of sensory cues in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of attended targets relative to irrelevant maskers or other objects in the environment ( Baluch and Itti, 2011; Desimone and Duncan, 1995; Senkowski et al., 2005 ). Whether attending to someone\u2019s voice amidst a crowd, or spotting that person in a busy street, or even identifying a particular smell among others, changes to neural encoding due to attention have been reported across all sensory modalities including auditory, visual, olfactory and somatosensory systems and appear to operate across multiple neural scales ( Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Zelano et al., 2005; Bauer et al., 2006; Knudsen, 2007 ). Response profiles of individual neurons, entire sensory circuits, and cross brain regions are modulated by attentional feedback to produce neural responses that reflect not only the physical properties of the stimulus but also the behavioral state and reward expectations of the system. Some of the hallmarks of selective attention are enhanced neural encoding in sensory cortex of attended features and dynamics ( e. g. envelope of an attended speaker; Mazziotta et al., 2001 ) as well as recruitment of dorsal fronto-parietal circuits mediated by boosted gamma oscillatory activity ( Fries, 2009; Baluch and Itti, 2011 ). In contrast, our understanding of the effects of involuntary ( \u2018bottom-up\u2019 or exogenous ) attention has been mostly led by work in vision. There is a well established link between perceptual attributes of salience and their influence on attention deployment in visual scenes ( Borji et al., 2013; Treue, 2003; Wolfe and Horowitz, 2004 ). Studies of visual salience greatly benefited from natural behaviors such as eye gaze which facilitate tracking subjects\u2019 attentional focus and allow the use of rich and naturalistic stimuli including still pictures and videos ( Borji, 2015; Carmi and Itti, 2006; Marius 't Hart et al., 2009 ). In parallel, exploration of brain networks implicated in visual salience revealed engagement of both subcortical and cortical circuits that balance the sensory conspicuity of a visual scene with more task-related information to shape attentional orienting to salient visual objects ( Veale et al., 2016 ). Bottom-up attention also engages ventral fronto-parietal circuits that orient subjects\u2019 focus to salient stimuli outside the spotlight of voluntary attention ( Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Fox et al., 2006; Asplund et al., 2010 ). By comparison, the study of auditory bottom-up attention has proven more challenging owing to the difficulty of properly defining behavioral metrics that determine when attention is captured by a salient sound. Pupilometry has been explored in auditory salience studies with recent evidence suggesting a correlation between stimulus salience and pupil size ( Liao et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2019 ). Still, there are various aspects of this correlation that remain ill understood, with some evidence suggesting that a large component of the pupillary response is driven by the sound\u2019s loudness and its local context rather than a full account of its perceptual salience ( Liao et al., 2017; Huang and Elhilali, 2017 ). In parallel, a large body of work has focused on deviance detection in auditory sequences, and has established neural markers associated with deviant or rare events. An example of such a response is mismatch negativity ( MMN ) which can be elicited pre-attentively, though this response is modulated by attention and associated with behavioral measures of distraction ( Ririe et al., 2017; N\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen et al., 2007 ). By using sequences with deviant tokens or snippets, studies of novelty processing are able to better control the acoustic parameters of the stimulus and the precise occurrence and nature of salient events. Other studies have extended oddball designs using richer sound structures including musical sequences or noise patterns, but still piecing together sound tokens to control presence of transient salient events in the acoustic signal ( Duangudom and Anderson, 2013; Kayser et al., 2005; Kaya and Elhilali, 2014; Tordini et al., 2015 ). Nonetheless, this structure falls short of the natural intricacies of realistic sounds in everyday environments where salience can take on more nuanced manifestations. Similar to established results in vision, use of natural soundscapes could not only extend results observed with simpler oddball sequences; but also shed light on the privileged processing status of social signals that reflect attentional capture in everyday life ( Doherty et al., 2017 ). In the current work, we explore dynamic deployment of attention using an unconstrained dataset of natural sounds. The collection includes a variety of contents and compositions, and spans samples from everyday situations taken from public databases such as YouTube and Freesound. It covers various settings such as a busy cafeteria, a ballgame at the stadium, a concert in a symphony hall, a dog park, and a protest in the streets. Concurrent with these everyday sounds, subjects\u2019 attention is directed towards a controlled tone sequence where we examine effects of top-down attention to this rhythmic sequence as well as intermittent switches of attention elicited by salient events in background scenes. This paradigm tackles three key limitations in our understanding of the dynamic deployment of attentional resources in complex auditory scenes. First, the study investigates the relationship between auditory salience and bottom-up attentional capture beyond deviance detection paradigms. The stimulus probes how distracting events in a background scene organically compete for attentional resources already deployed toward a dynamic sound sequence. Unlike clearly defined \u2018deviants\u2019 typically used in oddball paradigms, the attention-grabbing nature of salient events in natural soundscapes is more behaviorally and cognitively nuanced and exhibits a wide range of dynamics both in strength and buildup. A salient event in a complex scene can vary from a momentary transient event ( e. g. a phone ringing in an auditorium ) to a gradually dynamic sound ( e. g. a distinct voice steadily emerging from the cacophony in a busy cafeteria ). Here, we are interested in probing whether this natural and nuanced capture of attention induces equally profound effects on brain responses as previously reported from top-down, task-related attention. The study leverages the organic nature of competition between bottom-up and top-down attention in natural soundscapes to not only test the hypothesis of limited resources shared between the two modes of attention, but also engagement of distinct but overlapping brain networks ( Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Salmi et al., 2009 ). Second, employing dynamic scenes allows us to focus our analysis beyond event-related potentials ( ERPs ) which require precisely-aligned event onsets, hence often limiting paradigms to oddball designs or intermittent distractors. In the current study, the use of continuous scenes is anchored against a rhythmic attended sequence which provides a reference for temporal alignment of competing attentional states throughout the experiment. Third, while the study sheds lights on neural markers of auditory salience, it does so relative to a competing sequence in a controlled attentional task. As such, it balances the dichotomy often found in studies of auditory salience using either distraction or detection paradigms. A number of studies probe bottom-up attention using irrelevant stimuli presented to the subjects without necessarily competing for their attentional focus; or where subjects are informed or learn their value ( see Lavie, 2005 ). Here, we are interested in characterizing the dynamic effect of salient distractors on the encoding of attended targets. Ultimately, the current study aims to determine how well we can predict the existence of attention-grabbing events while subjects are engaged in a competing task.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: When walking into a busy restaurant or caf\u00e9, our sense of hearing is bombarded with different sounds that our brain has to sort through to make sense of our surroundings. Our brain has to balance the desire to focus our attention on sounds we choose to listen to ( such as the friend we are having a conversation with ) and sounds that attract our attention ( such as the sound of someone else\u2019s phone ringing ). Without the ability to be distracted, we might miss a noise that may or may not be crucial to our survival, like the engine roar of an approaching vehicle or a ping notifying us of an incoming email. However, it remains unclear what happens in our brains that enables us to shift our attention to background sounds. To investigate this further, Huang and Elhilali asked 81 participants to focus their attention on a repeating sound while being exposed to background noises from everyday life, such as sounds from a busy caf\u00e9. The experiment showed that when a more noticeable sound happened in the background, such as a loud voice, the participants were more likely to lose attention on their task and miss changes in the tone of the repeating sound. Huang and Elhilali then measured the brain activity of 12 participants as they counted the number of altered tones in a sequence of sounds, again with noise in the background. This revealed that brain waves synchronized with tones that the participants were concentrating on. However, once there was a noticeable event in the background, this tone synchronization was reduced and the brain waves aligned with the background noise. Huang and Elhilali found that distracting noises in the background activate the same region of the brain as sounds we choose to listen to. This demonstrates how background sounds are able to re-direct our attention. These results are consistent with the idea that we have a limited capacity for attention, and that new sensory information can divert brain activity. Having a better understanding of how these processes work could help develop better communication aids for people with impaired hearing, and improve software for interpreting sounds with a noisy background ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nGut enzymes can metabolize plant defense compounds and thereby affect the growth and fitness of insect herbivores. Whether these enzymes also influence feeding preference is largely unknown. We studied the metabolization of taraxinic acid \u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl ester ( TA-G ), a sesquiterpene lactone of the common dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ) that deters its major root herbivore, the common cockchafer larva ( Melolontha melolontha ). We have demonstrated that TA-G is rapidly deglucosylated and conjugated to glutathione in the insect gut. A broad-spectrum M. melolontha \u03b2-glucosidase, Mm_bGlc17, is sufficient and necessary for TA-G deglucosylation. Using cross-species RNA interference, we have shown that Mm_bGlc17 reduces TA-G toxicity. Furthermore, Mm_bGlc17 is required for the preference of M. melolontha larvae for TA-G-deficient plants. Thus, herbivore metabolism modulates both the toxicity and deterrence of a plant defense compound. Our work illustrates the multifaceted roles of insect digestive enzymes as mediators of plant-herbivore interactions.  Plants produce an arsenal of toxic secondary metabolites, many of which protect them against phytophagous insects by acting as toxins, digestibility reducers, repellents, and deterrents ( Mith\u00f6fer and Boland, 2012 ). Insect herbivores commonly metabolize defense metabolites, with important consequences for the toxicity of the compounds ( Heckel, 2014; Pentzold et al., 2014 ). Recent studies identified a series of enzymes that metabolize plant defense metabolites and thereby benefit herbivore growth and fitness ( Sun et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020; Poreddy et al., 2015 ). However, to date, the behavioral consequences of insect metabolism of plant defense metabolites are little understood, despite the importance of behavioral effects of plant defenses for plant fitness and evolution in nature ( Mith\u00f6fer and Boland, 2012; Huber et al., 2016a; Huber et al., 2016b; War et al., 2012 ). Insect enzymes that were identified to metabolize plant defense compounds belong mainly to a few large enzyme classes including the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, UDP-glycosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases ( Mao et al., 2007; Heidel-Fischer and Vogel, 2015; Bass et al., 2013; Maag et al., 2014; Wouters et al., 2014 ). However, members of other enzyme groups can participate in detoxification, some of which are also involved in primary digestive processes for the breakdown of carbohydrates ( \u03b2-glucosidases ), proteins ( proteases ), and lipids ( lipases ). For instance, a Manduca sexta \u03b2-glucosidase deglycosylates the Nicotiana attenuata diterpene glycoside lyciumoside IV, thus alleviating its toxicity ( Poreddy et al., 2015 ). Similarly, the Mexican bean weevil ( Zabrotes subfasciatus ) expresses a protease that degrades \u03b1-amylase inhibitors from its host, the common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) ( Ishimoto and Chrispeels, 1996 ). Finally, several insects degrade antinutritional plant protease inhibitors through intestinal proteases ( Giri et al., 1998; Zhu-Salzman and Zeng, 2015 ). Together, these studies suggest that families of typical digestive enzymes should be examined more carefully for possible roles in the detoxification of plant chemicals. Enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion may play a particular role in processing plant defense glycosides. Such compounds are typically considered protoxins, non-toxic, glycosylated precursors that are brought into contact with compartmentalized plant glycosidases upon tissue damage to yield toxic aglycones ( Wittstock and Gershenzon, 2002 ). Both plant and insect glycosidases may activate plant defense glycosides ( Pentzold et al., 2014 ). The alkaloid glucoside vicine in fava beans, for instance, is hydrolyzed to the toxic aglycone divicine in the gut of bruchid beetles ( Desroches et al., 1997 ). Similarly, phenolic glycoside toxins are hydrolyzed rapidly by Papilio glaucus, the eastern tiger swallowtail. P. glaucus subspecies adapted to phenolic glycoside-containing poplars and willow show significantly lower hydrolysis of these metabolites ( Lindroth, 1988 ). Finally, iridoid glycosides from Plantago species are hydrolyzed and thereby activated by herbivore-derived \u03b2-glucosidases, and \u03b2-glucosidase activity is negatively correlated with host plant adaptation both within and between species ( Pankoke et al., 2012; Pankoke and Dobler, 2015 ). These studies show that herbivore-derived enzymes may cleave plant protoxins and so may be a target of host plant adaptation. However, the genetic basis of protoxin activation by herbivores and the biological consequences of this phenomenon for insect feeding preference and performance are poorly understood. Although the deglycosylation of plant defense metabolites is commonly assumed to be disadvantageous for the herbivore, a recent study in M. sexta showed that deglycosylation of a plant glycoside may decrease rather than increase toxicity ( Poreddy et al., 2015 ). Silencing M. sexta \u03b2-glucosidase one resulted in developmental defects in larvae feeding on N. attenuata plants producing the diterpene glycoside lyciumoside IV ( Lyc4 ), but not in larvae feeding on Lyc4-deficient plants, suggesting that deglycosylation detoxifies rather than activates Lyc4. Although Lyc4 is an atypical defensive glycoside that carries several different sugar moieties and is only partially deglycosylated by M. sexta, these results bring up the possibility that defensive activation by glycoside hydrolysis does not necessarily increase the toxicity of these compounds, but may be a detoxification strategy. Clearly, more research on how glycoside hydrolysis by digestive enzymes impacts herbivores is needed to understand the role of this process in plant-herbivore interactions ( Pentzold et al., 2014; Poreddy et al., 2015; Marti et al., 2013 ). The herbivore toxins derived from glycoside protoxins have often been investigated for their defensive roles in connection with herbivore growth and development ( Poreddy et al., 2015; Desroches et al., 1997; Lindroth, 1988; Pankoke et al., 2012; Pankoke and Dobler, 2015 ) rather than feeding deterrence, despite the fact that the latter is a well-established mechanism for plant protection in this context ( Pollard, 1992 ). For example, the maize benzoxazinoid glucoside HDMBOA-Glc reduces food intake by Spodoptera caterpillars as soon as the glucoside moiety is cleaved off by plant \u03b2-glucosidases ( Glauser et al., 2011 ). Similarly, the deterrent effect of cyanogenic glucosides in Sorghum toward Spodoptera frugiperda is directly dependent on a functional plant \u03b2-glucosidase that releases cyanide upon tissue disruption ( Krothapalli et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, different glucosinolate breakdown products have been shown to affect oviposition and feeding choices by Pieris rapae and Trichoplusia ni ( de Vos et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2006; Mumm et al., 2008 ). However, whether protoxin activation by herbivore-derived enzymes influences herbivore host plant choice remains unknown. All protoxin-activating enzymes that have been characterized so far in insect herbivores are \u03b2-glucosidases, which cleave \u03b2-D-glucosides and release free glucose ( Pentzold et al., 2014 ). The primary role of \u03b2-glucosidases in insect digestion is to function in the last steps of cellulose and hemicellulose breakdown by converting cellobiose to glucose ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). Most insect \u03b2-glucosidases, however, also accept other substrates, including various di- and oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, which may help herbivores to obtain glucose from various sources and enable the further breakdown of glycosylated proteins and lipids ( Marana et al., 2000; Azevedo et al., 2003; Ferreira et al., 2003; Ferreira et al., 2001 ). However, the broad substrate specificity of insect \u03b2-glucosidases for plant glucosides with an aryl or alkyl moiety may also result in the activation of defense metabolites, as discussed above ( Terra and Ferreira, 1994 ). Thus, investigating the substrate specificity and the biochemical function of insect \u03b2-glucosidases is important to understand the ecology and evolution of insect-mediated protoxin activation. Known plant protoxins include glucosinolates, salicinoids, and cyanogenic, iridoid, and benzoxazinoid glycosides. Plants produce many other types of glycosides that may also be protoxins, but most of these have not yet been carefully investigated for their toxicity or metabolic stability in herbivores. Among these potential protoxins are the bitter-tasting sesquiterpene lactone glycosides. Sesquiterpene lactones form a large group of over 2000 plant defense compounds found principally in the Asteraceae family, with glycosides especially common in the latex-producing tribe Cichorieae, which enters the human diet through lettuce, endive, and chicory ( Chadwick et al., 2013 ). These substances have a long appreciated role in defense against insect herbivores ( Picman, 1986 ), but it is not clear if glycosylated sesquiterpene lactones should be considered as protoxins that are activated by plant damage. Here, we studied the metabolism of a sesquiterpene lactone glucoside during the interaction between the common dandelion Taraxacum officinale aggregate ( Asteraceae, Chicorieae ) and the larvae of the common cockchafer, Melolontha melolontha ( Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae ) ( Keller et al., 1986; Hasler, 1986 ). M. melolontha larvae feed on roots of different plant species including members of Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Salicaceae, and Asteraceae families, which can contain glycosylated defense compounds such as benzoxazinoids, glucosinolates, and salicinoids, as well as sesquiterpene lactone glycosides ( Kondor et al., 2007; Hauss and Sch\u00fctte, 1976; Hauss, 1975; Sukovata et al., 2015 ). The alkaline gut pH of M. melolontha ( pH = 8. 0\u20138. 5 ) possibly facilitates its polyphagous feeding habit by inhibiting the often acidic activating glucosidases of plant protoxins ( Pentzold et al., 2014; Egert et al., 2005 ). In the third and final instars, M. melolontha prefers to feed on T. officinale, which produces large quantities of latex in its roots ( Hauss and Sch\u00fctte, 1976; Huber et al., 2015 ). The most abundant latex compound, the sesquiterpene lactone glucoside taraxinic acid ( TA ) \u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl ester ( TA-G ), deters M. melolontha feeding and thereby benefits plant fitness ( Huber et al., 2016a; Huber et al., 2016b; Huber et al., 2015 ). To understand the interaction between TA-G and M. melolontha, we first investigated whether TA-G is deglucosylated during insect feeding and whether plant or insect enzymes are involved. We then identified M. melolontha \u03b2-glucosidases that might hydrolyze TA-G through a comparative transcriptomic approach and narrowed down the list of candidate genes through in vitro characterization of heterologously expressed proteins. Finally, we silenced TA-G-hydrolyzing \u03b2-glucosidases in M. melolontha through RNA interference ( RNAi ) and determined the effect of these enzymes on TA-G hydrolysis, toxicity, and deterrence in vivo. Taken together, our results reveal that \u03b2-glucosidases modify the effects of plant defense metabolites on both herbivore performance and host plant choice, with potentially important consequences for the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Plants produce certain substances to fend off attackers like plant-feeding insects. To stop these compounds from damaging their own cells, plants often attach sugar molecules to them. When an insect tries to eat the plant, the plant removes the stabilizing sugar, \u2018activating\u2019 the compounds and making them toxic or foul-tasting. Curiously, some insects remove the sugar themselves, but it is unclear what consequences this has, especially for insect behavior. Dandelions, Taraxacum officinale, make high concentrations of a sugar-containing defense compound in their roots called taraxinic acid \u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl ester, or TA-G for short. TA-G deters the larvae of the Maybug \u2013 a pest also known as the common cockchafer or the doodlebug \u2013 from eating dandelion roots. When Maybug larvae do eat TA-G, it is found in their systems without its sugar. However, it is unclear whether it is the plant or the larva that removes the sugar. A second open question is how the sugar removal process affects the behavior of the Maybug larvae. Using chemical analysis and genetic manipulation, Huber et al. investigated what happens when Maybug larvae eat TA-G. This revealed that the acidity levels in the larvae\u2019s digestive system deactivate the proteins from the dandelion that would normally remove the sugar from TA-G. However, rather than leaving the compound intact, larvae remove the sugar from TA-G themselves. They do this using a digestive enzyme, known as a beta-glucosidase, that cuts through sugar. Removing the sugar from TA-G made the compound less toxic, allowing the larvae to grow bigger, but it also increased TA-G\u2019s deterrent effects, making the larvae less likely to eat the roots. Any organism that eats plants, including humans, must deal with chemicals like TA-G in their food. Once inside the body, enzymes can change these chemicals, altering their effects. This happens with many medicines, too. In the future, it might be possible to design compounds that activate only in certain species, or under certain conditions. Further studies in different systems may aid the development of new methods of pest control, or new drug treatments ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nActions motivated by rewards are often associated with risk of punishment. Little is known about the neural representation of punishment risk during reward-seeking behavior. We modeled this circumstance in rats by designing a task where actions were consistently rewarded but probabilistically punished. Spike activity and local field potentials were recorded during task performance simultaneously from VTA and mPFC, two reciprocally connected regions implicated in reward-seeking and aversive behaviors. At the single unit level, we found that ensembles of putative dopamine and non-dopamine VTA neurons and mPFC neurons encode the relationship between action and punishment. At the network level, we found that coherent theta oscillations synchronize VTA and mPFC in a bottom-up direction, effectively phase-modulating the neuronal spike activity in the two regions during punishment-free actions. This synchrony declined as a function of punishment probability, suggesting that during reward-seeking actions, risk of punishment diminishes VTA-driven neural synchrony between the two regions.  Goal-directed actions aimed at obtaining a reward often involve exposure to an aversive event or punishment. For example, foraging for food in the wild may result in encountering a predator. In a causally and socially complex world, appropriate representation of punishment that lurks around during reward-seeking actions is critical for survival and optimal action selection. Deficits in this representation may be associated with detrimental behavioral patterns observed in impulsive behavior and addictive disorders while exaggerated representation of punishment risk may be linked to anxiety disorders ( Bechara et al., 2000; Gillan et al., 2016; Hartley and Phelps, 2012; Lee, 2013; Mineka et al., 1998 ). How is risk of punishment associated with reward-seeking actions represented by the brain ? To begin to address this question, we focused on the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) and the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ). Neurons in the VTA including dopamine ( DA ) and non-dopamine neurons are critical components of the reward circuitry including reward-mediated actions ( Cohen et al., 2012; Matsumoto et al., 2016; Roesch et al., 2007; Schultz, 1998; Tan et al., 2012; van Zessen et al., 2012; Wise, 2004; Wood et al., 2017 ). We, therefore, hypothesized that ensembles of VTA neurons represent risk of punishment associated with reward-guided behavior. Importance of VTA notwithstanding, the mPFC is also implicated in reward representation and reward-guided action selection ( Barraclough et al., 2004; Buschman et al., 2012; Kobayashi et al., 2006; Powell and Redish, 2016; Rich and Shapiro, 2009 ), as well as control of aversive and anxiety-like behavior ( Adhikari et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2014; Likhtik et al., 2014; Park et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2016 ). At the network level, the mPFC and VTA ( both DA and non-DA neurons ) send reciprocal projections to each other ( Berger et al., 1976; Carr and Sesack, 2000a; 2000b ). The VTA neurons projecting to mPFC have been shown to respond to stressful and anxiogenic drugs with a greater degree of sensitivity compared to the mesolimbic or mesostriatal projections ( Abercrombie et al., 1989; Bradberry et al., 1991; Moghaddam et al., 1990; Thierry et al., 1976 ). Furthermore, photostimulation of the VTA DA input to the mPFC elicits anxiety-like behavior ( Gunaydin et al., 2014; Lammel et al., 2012 ), suggesting a more causal role for this neural circuit in aversive behavior. Given this, we further hypothesized that the interaction between VTA and mPFC provides a dynamic representation of punishment risk during reward-seeking actions. To test these hypotheses, we first designed and validated a task that allowed us to assess reward-guided actions in the absence or presence of punishment risk in the same recording session. The latter criterion was critical because it allowed us to track the activity of the same ensembles of neurons as a function of punishment risk. The task was designed so that an instrumental action always procured a reward, but the same action probabilistically led to punishment with blockwise varying degrees of contingency. Thus, different blocks had varying risk of punishment associated with an action while action-reward contingency remained constant. We then recorded single unit activity and local field potentials ( LFP ) from the VTA and mPFC simultaneously during this task. The simultaneous recording allowed us to compare the inter- and intra-regional neural codes for punishment risk-based modulation of behavioral events. At the single unit level, we found that VTA and mPFC neurons encode risk of punishment and blockwise/trial-by-trial behavioral modulation during action execution. At the network level, we found that coherent theta oscillations synchronize the VTA and mPFC in a bottom-up direction, effectively phase-modulating the neuronal spike activity in the two regions during punishment-free actions. This oscillation-mediated neural synchrony declined as a function of punishment risk, suggesting that desynchronization of coordinated activity in these two regions signals punishment.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: When deciding what to do, we usually try to predict the likely outcomes of our actions. This helps us choose behaviors that will lead to positive outcomes, or rewards, and avoid those that will lead to negative outcomes, or punishments. But in practice, actions that offer the possibility of reward often involve varying degrees of risk. When animals forage for food, for example, they risk encountering a predator. In our complex social world, applying for a job or asking someone out on a date means risking rejection. Being able to weigh up the likelihood of positive and negative outcomes is vital for effective decision-making. Park and Moghaddam have now studied how the brain\u2019s reward system takes account of possible negative outcomes. Rats learned to poke their noses into a window inside a testing box whenever a light came on, to earn a sugar reward. The rats completed three blocks of trials. During the first block, they received only rewards. But for a few trials during the second and third blocks, they also received a mild electric shock as well as their reward. Throughout the task, Park and Moghaddam monitored the activity of two regions of the brain that encode rewards, the ventral tegmental area ( or VTA for short ) and the medial prefrontal cortex. The VTA sits deep within the brain and produces the brain\u2019s reward chemical, dopamine. The prefrontal cortex is at the front of the brain and helps support cognition. In the reward-only block of trials, neurons in the VTA synchronized their firing with neurons in the prefrontal cortex. In blocks two and three, where there was a risk of shock, this synchrony decreased. This suggests that the prefrontal cortex takes greater control of decision-making when an unpleasant outcome is possible. Consistently overestimating the risk of things going wrong will lead to anxiety. Underestimating the risks will lead to impulsivity and poor decision-making. Park and Moghaddam\u2019s experiment offers a way to study the mechanisms underlying these processes in animals. The results also suggest that using scalp electrodes to track prefrontal cortex activity in patients could be helpful in clinical trials for anxiety or impulse-control disorders ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nCorrelations in brain activity between two areas ( functional connectivity ) have been shown to relate to their underlying structural connections. We examine the possibility that functional connectivity also reflects short-term changes in synaptic efficacy. We demonstrate that paired transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) near ventral premotor cortex ( PMv ) and primary motor cortex ( M1 ) with a short 8-ms inter-pulse interval evoking synchronous pre- and post-synaptic activity and which strengthens interregional connectivity between the two areas in a pattern consistent with Hebbian plasticity, leads to increased functional connectivity between PMv and M1 as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ). Moreover, we show that strengthening connectivity between these nodes has effects on a wider network of areas, such as decreasing coupling in a parallel motor programming stream. A control experiment revealed that identical TMS pulses at identical frequencies caused no change in fMRI-measured functional connectivity when the inter-pulse-interval was too long for Hebbian-like plasticity.  Temporal correlations in activity between brain areas can be measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and are often referred to as indices of \u2018functional connectivity\u2019 ( Friston, 1994 ). Statistical dependencies between remote cortical regions exist both in the absence of external stimuli or task demands ( i. e., during the resting state ) and during execution of a task ( Hampson et al., 2002 ). In the following, the term functional connectivity therefore simply describes a statistical relationship of neural elements with each other. In addition to providing insights into the basic anatomical and physiological organization of healthy neural networks ( Fox and Raichle, 2007; Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Smith et al., 2009; O'Reilly et al., 2013 ), functional connectivity has been used to identify pathological changes occurring in neural circuits in conditions such as stroke ( Wang et al., 2010 ), traumatic brain injury ( Bonnelle et al., 2011; Ham and Sharp, 2012 ), neurodegeneration ( Seeley et al., 2009 ), or psychiatric disorders ( Bassett et al., 2008 ). Although changes in fMRI-based functional connectivity can be highly specific, their underlying biological mechanisms are less clear. It is thought that functional connectivity patterns are shaped largely by the relatively stable underlying skeleton of structural connections ( O'Reilly et al., 2013 ). However, modifications in functional connectivity might also be influenced by changes in synaptic efficacy, for example through changes in the quantity of neurotransmitter release, changes in astrocytes or dendritic spine stabilization. Here, we aimed to elucidate the contribution of changes in short-term synaptic efficacy to fMRI-based functional connectivity. To this aim, we modulated synaptic efficacy in a specific corticocortical pathway using repetitive paired pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) with a brief inter-pulse interval ( IPI; 8 ms ) that evoked synchronous pre- and post-synaptic activity and monitored whether those changes were reflected in altered functional connectivity ( Experiment 1 ) ( Figure 1A ). Several TMS protocols have been shown to induce changes in excitability in primary motor cortex ( M1 ) using repetitive stimulation of M1 itself ( Chen et al., 1997 ) or stimulation of premotor regions projecting to M1 ( Munchau et al., 2002 ). These changes are often thought to reflect frequency-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission. Furthermore, it has been shown that repetitive paired stimulation of an input into M1\u2014such as the median nerve\u2014and then of M1 itself can change M1 cortico-spinal excitability ( Stefan et al., 2000; Wolters et al., 2003 ). These paired associative stimulation ( PAS ) protocols are based upon Hebbian principles of synaptic plasticity and appear to modify connectivity in a controlled manner. Investigations that applied paired-pulse TMS over interconnected sites\u2014for example, homotopical M1 sites ( Rizzo et al., 2009 ), M1 and the supplementary motor area ( SMA ) ( Arai et al., 2011 ), and M1 and posterior parietal cortex ( Koch et al., 2013 ) \u2014demonstrated altered motor cortical excitability. Notably, the current protocol of repetitive paired-pulse TMS has been shown to induce a causal and directional change of influence of the first brain region ( ventral premotor cortex: PMv ) over the anatomically connected second region ( M1 ) ( Buch et al., 2011 ). This is important since it is such pathway-specific changes that occur in animal models of synaptic plasticity ( Markram et al., 1997; Jackson et al., 2006 ) and these are argued to underlie the self-organization proposed to occur in mono-synaptically connected networks in response to regularly occurring input ( Sussillo and Abbott, 2009 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 04585. 003Figure 1. Experimental procedure. ( A ) 90 paired pulses were applied over ventral frontal cortex near PMv and M1 ( mean MNI coordinates [\u221256 19 19] and [\u221240 \u221218 59] respectively ) at 0. 1 Hz for 15 min. ( B ) Individual stimulation locations for 8 ms IPI ( red ) and 500 ms IPI ( blue ). ( C ) Participants performed visually guided grasping movements towards one of two objects ( small or large; see inset ) while lying supine in the MR scanner. The head coil was tilted forward by 30\u00b0 to allow for direct line of sight of the objects to be grasped. A response button box was positioned on the upper leg. ( D ) Experimental design and setup for all experiments ( for both 8 ms IPI and 500 ms IPI experiment ). The order of resting-state and grasping task fMRI as well as of pre-TMS ( baseline ) and post-TMS sessions was counterbalanced. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 04585. 003 PMv and M1 are a part of the so-called \u2018dorsolateral circuit\u2019 of areas composed of the anterior intraparietal ( AIP ) area, areas PF and PFG in the inferior parietal lobule, and PMv and M1 in the frontal lobes. During complex motor behaviour such as reaching and grasping this dorsolateral sensorimotor stream is complemented by a \u2018dorsomedial circuit\u2019 composed of dorsal premotor ( PMd ), medial intraparietal area ( MIP ), and posterior superior parietal cortex ( pSPL ) ( Jeannerod et al., 1995; Wise et al., 1997; Tanne-Gariepy et al., 2002; Galletti et al., 2003; Brochier and Umilt\u00e0, 2007; Grafton, 2010; Turella and Lingnau, 2014 ). As is the case for other inter-regional connections, the connections between premotor cortex and M1 are glutamatergic, excitatory ones, but there are synapses on both pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons within M1 ( Tokuno and Nambu, 2000 ). This means that although paired stimulation of PMv and M1 leads to strengthening of the excitatory connections between PMv and M1, such strengthening can lead to both enhanced facilitatory and enhanced inhibitory influences of PMv on M1. Enhanced facilitatory influences are more apparent when subjects are subsequently tested while performing a simple reaching and grasping task, and enhanced inhibitory influences are more apparent when subjects are subsequently tested while at rest ( Buch et al., 2011 ). These different effects appear as a function of the subject's behavioural and cognitive state at the time of testing ( B\u00e4umer et al., 2009; Buch et al., 2010 ), but they have not been shown to depend on the subject's cognitive state at the time of plasticity induction ( Buch et al., 2011 ). PMv microwire stimulation in macaques has also been shown to exert both facilitatory and inhibitory effects on corticospinal outputs as a function of the animal's state ( Prabhu et al., 2009 ). In the following, this causal and directional influence as quantified by motor-evoked potentials ( MEPs ) is referred to as \u2018effective connectivity\u2019 ( Friston, 1994 ). Classic Hebbian synaptic learning rules such as pathway specificity, spike timing dependency, rapid evolution, persistence for several hours, and reversibility have been demonstrated for this directed pathway manipulation. Using TMS in this way entails a direct and specific inter-areal manipulation distinct from the compensatory plasticity that occurs following single-site manipulations of neural activity by means of TMS ( Lee et al., 2003; O'Shea et al., 2007; Grefkes et al., 2010; Hartwigsen et al., 2012 ). Recent studies have shown that lesions and disruption of brain areas as well as lesions to connections between brain areas can affect distant areas and connections ( O'Shea et al., 2007; Hartwigsen et al., 2012; O'Reilly et al., 2013 ). These changes are thought to be partly compensatory. For example, in the study by O'Shea et al. ( 2007 ), it is suggested that \u2018activity\u2019 in contralateral \u2018non-dominant\u2019 PMd is increased after interruption of ipsilateral PMd. This enhancement of contralateral PMd is accompanied by preserved performance in a stimulus-response matching task. Similarly, Hartwigsen et al. ( 2012 ) show that action reprogramming can be preserved after PMd interference if the supramarginal gyrus is uncompromised. This study suggests a rapid redistribution of functional weights in order to compensate for interference. Moreover, it has been shown that the interruption of specific pathways has effects far beyond the regions that are directly connected by the pathway ( O'Reilly et al., 2013 ). Here by contrast, we study the functional enhancement of a pathway, rather than the disruption of a region or pathway, and its effect on coupling within and outside the targeted network. To ensure that the changes in functional connectivity we observed could be attributed to plasticity induction, we performed a control experiment of paired-pulse TMS over the same cortical regions ( Experiment 2 ) stimulating with the same number of pulses at the same frequency but with an IPI which precluded spike timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ) ( IPI: 500 ms ). We decided on a 500 ms IPI for the control condition following the exclusion of several other alternative IPIs; we decided against reversing the order of conditioning and test stimulus because we have demonstrated in a previous study that this stimulation order leads to long-term depression-like effects ( as assessed by examining the impact of further PMv TMS pulses on M1 ( Buch et al., 2011 ) ; against stimulating both areas at the same time because I-wave interactions may occur at such IPIs ( Prabhu et al., 2009 ) ; against any time interval below 50 ms because there is evidence of plasticity induction at such intervals within the motor system of freely behaving monkeys ( Jackson et al., 2006 ). Moreover, we noted that long-interval intracortical inhibition ( LICI ) within M1 has been demonstrated with TMS using IPIs of up to 200 ms ( Valls-Sol\u00e9 et al., 1992 ). Admittedly, other intervals in the hundred milliseconds range might equally have been chosen. Targeting the same cortical areas controlled for the impact of stimulation on brain activity in each component node that the pathway interconnects; if changes in connectivity are simply attributable to stimulation of each area, rather than increased pathway efficacy, then changes in functional connectivity ought to be comparable in Experiment 1 and 2. Here, we show that pathway functional connectivity was not modulated in Experiment 2. By increasing synaptic efficacy in a corticocortical connection\u2014PMv-M1\u2014involved in complex motor behaviour, we were able to study the relationship of induced plasticity and functional connectivity during the performance of a motor task as well as during the resting state. Further, investigation of a wider motor network provided information about functional reorganisation in response to pathway-specific plasticity induction. In Experiment 3, we directly tested whether estimates of pathway connectivity based on fMRI data share construct validity with measures of effective connectivity indexed by MEP amplitude ratios across subjects. We demonstrated a direct correlation between the strengths of the two measures for both cognitive states ( i. e., resting and grasping ), however, the sign of net effective influence of one neural node over another was only determined by TMS-evoked measures and not by fMRI functional connectivity.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: When a person has their brain scanned, the resulting images show that regions with similar roles tend to be active at the same time. These coordinated patterns of activity are often altered in the brains of patients with neurological or psychiatric disorders. However, relatively little is known about how the patterns are generated. The degree to which brain regions are active at the same time is thought to depend partly on how well they are connected by brain cells. However, it is also possible that the coordinated activity reflects the extent to which one brain region is able to influence the activity of another. More than 50 years ago, it was demonstrated that this is the case between individual brain cells. If one brain cell repeatedly helps to activate another, the connection between the two cells will be strengthened. This process\u2014known as synaptic plasticity\u2014is thought to support learning and memory. Now, Johnen, Neubert et al. have shown that the same process can also act between different brain regions. A technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation\u2014in which magnetic fields are applied to specific areas of the scalp to excite brain tissue\u2014was used on human volunteers to activate two regions involved in producing grasping movements with their hands. If the first region of the brain was repeatedly activated a few milliseconds before the second region as the volunteers reached towards objects, the ability of the first region to activate the second increased. Notably, the effect was not seen when the interval between the activation of the regions was increased to 500 milliseconds: a delay long enough to ensure that brain cells in the first region were no longer active when the second region was stimulated. This suggests that coordinated changes in the activity of brain regions might reflect the same plasticity processes as changes in activity seen between individual brain cells. This finding raises the possibility that, by deliberately altering the degree of coordinated activity between specific brain regions, it might be possible to recover abilities that have been lost as a result of disorders such as stroke ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nWithout transposon-silencing Piwi-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs ), transposition causes an ovarian atrophy syndrome in Drosophila called gonadal dysgenesis ( GD ). Harwich ( Har ) strains with P-elements cause severe GD in F1 daughters when Har fathers mate with mothers lacking P-element-piRNAs ( i. e. ISO1 strain ). To address the mystery of why Har induces severe GD, we bred hybrid Drosophila with Har genomic fragments into the ISO1 background to create HISR-D or HISR-N lines that still cause Dysgenesis or are Non-dysgenic, respectively. In these lines, we discovered a highly truncated P-element variant we named \u2018Har-P\u2019 as the most frequent de novo insertion. Although HISR-D lines still contain full-length P-elements, HISR-N lines lost functional P-transposase but retained Har-P\u2019s that when crossed back to P-transposase restores GD induction. Finally, we uncovered P-element-piRNA-directed repression on Har-P\u2019s transmitted paternally to suppress somatic transposition. The Drosophila short Har-P\u2019s and full-length P-elements relationship parallels the MITEs/DNA-transposase in plants and SINEs/LINEs in mammals.  The sterility syndrome of \u2018P-M\u2019 hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster ( Engels and Preston, 1979; Kidwell et al., 1977 ) is due to uncontrolled P-element transposition that damages ovarian development and induces female sterility ( Bingham et al., 1982 and reviewed in Kelleher, 2016 ). This gonadal dysgenesis ( GD ) phenotype occurs in hybrid F1 daughters whose paternal genome comes from a father possessing active P-elements ( a \u2018P\u2019 strain ) and a maternal genome unable to express P-element piRNAs ( an \u2018M\u2019 strain ) ( Brennecke et al., 2008; Khurana et al., 2011 ). The fascinating nature of this genetic syndrome is complete fertility in daughters from the reciprocal cross because the mother possessing active P-elements contribute P-element-derived Piwi-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs ) to silence these transposons in daughters ( Brennecke et al., 2008; Khurana et al., 2011 ). Thus, despite identical genetic makeup in daughters between the reciprocal crosses, the epigenetic maternal transmission of transposon repression by piRNAs starkly defines female fertility ( illustrated in Figure 1A ). Between fertility and complete sterility lies a spectrum of GD induction variation amongst different strain crosses that may be attributed to differential P-element copy numbers in different strain genomes ( Anxolab\u00e9h\u00e8re et al., 1985; Bergman et al., 2017; Bi\u00e9mont et al., 1990; Bingham et al., 1982; Boussy et al., 1988; Kidwell et al., 1981; Ronsseray et al., 1989; Srivastav and Kelleher, 2017; Yoshitake et al., 2018 ), and capacity to generate piRNAs ( Wakisaka et al., 2017 ). In addition, there are many non-autonomous P-element variants that can be mobilized by P-transposases, including very short elements from the pi[2] strain ( Bingham et al., 1982; O'Hare and Rubin, 1983 ) that actually assemble in vitro with the P-transposase tetramer complex\u00a0>100X more efficiently than the full-length P-element ( Tang et al., 2007 ). However, many earlier studies perceived truncated variants such as the \u2018KP2\u2019 variants as inhibitors of transposition by acting to titrate P-transposase since P-element piRNAs were unknown at the time ( Black et al., 1987; Gloor et al., 1993; Jackson et al., 1988; Robertson and Engels, 1989; Simmons et al., 2002a ). Most studies of GD were typically calibrated with a strong paternal inducer \u2018P\u2019-strain like Harwich ( Har ) or pi[2] when mated with \u2018M\u2019 strain females lacking P-elements ( Bingham et al., 1982; Brennecke et al., 2008; Kidwell et al., 1977; Rubin et al., 1982 ). Despite over 40 years of study, what defines a strong paternal inducer of GD has remained a mystery. Although P-element copy numbers in Har are significant ( 120\u2013140 copies; Khurana et al., 2011 ), strains with even more copies like OreR-MOD do not induce GD whereas other strong inducer strains that have\u00a0>75% fewer P-element copies than Har can also trigger complete GD ( Figure 1B and C ). Thus, there is a lack of correlation between P-element copy number and GD induction ( Figure 1D ) that we and others have previously observed ( Bergman et al., 2017; Ronsseray et al., 1989; Srivastav and Kelleher, 2017 ). Since P-element copy numbers do not explain GD severity, we hypothesized that a special P-element variant or insertion locus might underlie the strong GD phenotype in certain strong \u2018P\u2019 strains like Har. To discover this P-element variant, we undertook a reductionist approach to find specific P-element variant ( s ) required for GD induction that revealed unexpectedly a short variant from the Har strain that may act together with the full-length P-transposase to drive strong GD.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: DNA provides the instructions needed for life, a role that relies on it being a very stable and organized molecule. However, some sections of DNA are able to move from one place in the genome to another. When these \u201cmobile genetic elements\u201d move they may disrupt other genes and cause disease. For example, a mobile section of DNA known as the P-element causes a condition called gonadal dysgenesis in female fruit flies, leading to infertility. Only certain strains of fruit flies carry P-elements and the severity of gonadal dysgenesis in their daughters varies. For example, when male fruit flies of a strain known as Harwich ( or Har for short ) is crossed with female fruit flies that do not contain P-elements, all of their daughters develop severe gonadal dysgenesis and are infertile. However, if the cross is done the other way around, and female Har flies mate with males that do not contain P-elements, the daughters are fertile because the Har mothers provide their daughters with protective molecules that silence the P-elements. But it was a mystery as to why the P-elements from the Har fathers always caused such severe gonadal dysgenesis in all the daughters. Here, Srivastav et al. bred fruit flies to create offspring that had different pieces of Har DNA in a genetic background that was normally free from P-elements; they then analyzed the \u2018hybrid\u2019 offspring to identify which pieces of the Har genome caused gonadal dysgenesis in the daughter flies. These experiments showed that Har flies possess a very short variant of the P-element ( named \u201cHar-P\u201d ) that is more mobile than other variants. However, the Har-P variants still depended on an enzyme known as P-transposase encoded by the full-length P-elements to move around the genome. Further experiments showed that other strains of fruit flies that cause severe gonadal dysgenesis also had very short P-element variants that were almost identical to Har-P. These findings may explain why Har and some other strains of fruit flies drive severe gonadal dysgenesis. In the future, it may be possible to transfer P-transposase and Har-P into mosquitoes, ticks and other biting insects to make them infertile and help reduce the spread of certain diseases in humans ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe mechanosensing ability of lymphocytes regulates their activation in response to antigen stimulation, but the underlying mechanism remains unexplored. Here, we report that B cell mechanosensing-governed activation requires BCR signaling molecules. PMA-induced activation of PKC\u03b2 can bypass the Btk and PLC-\u03b32 signaling molecules that are usually required for B cells to discriminate substrate stiffness. Instead, PKC\u03b2-dependent activation of FAK is required, leading to FAK-mediated potentiation of B cell spreading and adhesion responses. FAK inactivation or deficiency impaired B cell discrimination of substrate stiffness. Conversely, adhesion molecules greatly enhanced this capability of B cells. Lastly, B cells derived from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients exhibited an altered BCR response to substrate stiffness in comparison with healthy controls. These results provide a molecular explanation of how initiation of B cell activation discriminates substrate stiffness through a PKC\u03b2-mediated FAK activation dependent manner.  Cells interact with an intricate mechanical extracellular microenvironment by sensing physical signals and using surface receptors to convert them into chemical signals and, subsequently, cellular responses ( Sun et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015 ). Lymphocytes \u2013 the cells of the adaptive immune system \u2013 include B and T cells, both of which use surface expressed antigen receptors to sense external antigens. The B cell receptor ( BCR ) is composed of a membrane-bound entity of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) and an Ig\u03b1-Ig\u03b2 heterodimer in a 1:1 stoichiometry ( Pierce and Liu, 2010 ). The engagement of the BCR and antigen leads to initiation of B cell activation. It is known that antigens exhibit great diversity and B cell activation is remarkably sensitive to the diversity of antigen properties, including antigen density ( Liu et al., 2010a; Fleire et al., 2006 ), antigen affinity ( Liu et al., 2010a; Fleire et al., 2006 ), antigen valency ( Bachmann et al., 1993; Liu and Chen, 2005; Liu et al., 2004 ), and Brownian mobility of the antigen ( Wan and Liu, 2012 ). Previous studies\u00a0have suggested the extraordinary capability of B cells to sense the chemical and physical features of the antigen, although the presenting forms of antigen are far more complicated under\u00a0physiological conditions. Recent studies have\u00a0also suggested that the antigens encountered by B cells in vivo are presented on substrates with various stiffness ( also referred as rigidity or elasticity ) features ( Bachmann and Jennings, 2010 ). Stiffness describes the extent that an object resists deformations in response to an applied force, which is quantified by Young's modulus in units of Pascal ( Pa or N/m2 or m\u22121\u00b7kg\u00b7s\u22122 ) ( Discher et al., 2005 ). For example, antigen molecules presented by a viral capsid exhibit a high degree of stiffness ( 45, 000\u20131, 000, 000 kPa ) ( Mateu, 2012 ), while the same antigen molecules expressed\u00a0on the membrane of a virus-infected host cell show a medium level of stiffness ( 0. 01\u20131000 kPa ) ( Nemir and West, 2010 ), and if released from the virus into the plasma display a particularly low degree of stiffness ( several Pa ) ( Araujo et al., 2012 ). B cells acquire extracellular matrix ( ECM ) -associated antigens in a B cell receptor ( BCR ) and contact-dependent manner ( Ciechomska et al., 2014 ), in the presence of a considerable range of stiffness of ECM in the tissue, from 0. 012 kPa to 20 kPa ( Bao and Suresh, 2003; Paszek et al., 2005; Engler et al., 2004; Nemir and West, 2010 ). Recent studies have shown that the degree of stiffness of the substrates presenting the antigens efficiently regulates the activation of both B and T cells ( Wan et al., 2013; Bashour et al., 2014; O'Connor et al., 2012; Judokusumo et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2015; Wan et al., 2015; Saitakis et al., 2017 ) ; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unexplored. The ECM-associated microenvironment is an abundant source of antigens ( Tesniere et al., 2008; Schaefer, 2010; Knight, 2015 ). The capability of B cells to sense the stiffness features of antigen-presenting surfaces may be related to the pathological activation of auto-reactive B cells in autoimmune disease patients. For example, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ), reduced cartilage stiffness leads to auto-antigen-presenting B cells, which subsequently causes the production of auto-antibodies ( Mauri and Ehrenstein, 2007 ). Clinical reports strongly suggest that the altered stiffness properties of the ECM are linked to aberrant activation of auto-antigen reactive B cells. However, it is unknown whether the primary B cells in RA patients maintain their capability to discriminate the stiffness of the substrates presenting antigens, and if they\u00a0do, how such capabilities differ from\u00a0those\u00a0of primary B cells derived from healthy individuals. Canonically, it is well established that the cells are capable of sensing the mechanical signals from the microenvironment by the conventional mechanosensor that\u00a0is, integrin. The major types of integrin molecules expressed by B cells are leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 ( LFA-1 ) ( \u03b1L\u03b22 ) and very late antigen-4 ( VLA-4 ) ( \u03b14\u03b21 ) ( Arana et al., 2008a ). The ligands of LFA-1 and VLA-4 are adhesion molecules that is, intercellular adhesion molecules ( ICAM-1/2 ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ), respectively ( Arana et al., 2008a ). Previous studies investigating the responses of both B and T cells upon encountering antigens that were tethered to stiff and soft substrates generally did not use adhesion molecules in their experimental systems ( Wan et al., 2013; Bashour et al., 2014; O'Connor et al., 2012; Judokusumo et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2015 ). Early studies suggested that lymphocytes discern substrate stiffness independently of integrin signaling, but the details are unclear. More intriguingly, it is also unclear if or how the ability of lymphocytes to discriminate substrate stiffness is regulated by direct interaction between the\u00a0integrin and adhesion molecule. Here, we addressed all three of the aforementioned questions through a combination of molecular imaging with genetic and pharmacological approaches by examining initiation of B cell activation on antigen-presenting substrates with stiff or soft features. The two most commonly used substrates for in vitro mechanosensing studies are polyacrylamide ( PA ) and polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ). Both were used in this study to fabricate the soft and stiff substrates at contrasting ranges of 2. 6 versus 22. 1 kPa for PA ( Wan et al., 2013; Judokusumo et al., 2012 ) and 20 versus 1100 kPa for PDMS ( O'Connor et al., 2012 ). The results revealed that BCR signaling competent B cells can discriminate substrate stiffness through accumulating/polarizing more BCR molecules into the B cell immunological synapse ( IS ) when encountering stiff rather than soft substrates. In contrast, B cells deficient for each of the early BCR signaling molecules including tyrosine-protein kinase ( Lyn ), spleen tyrosine kinase ( Syk ), phospholipase C\u03b32 ( PLC\u03b32 ), Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase ( Btk ), B-cell linker protein ( BLNK ), and protein kinase C ( PKC\u03b2 ), lose this discrimination capability. Moreover, we found that PKC\u03b2 functions downstream of Btk and PLC\u03b32, as PMA-induced activation of PKC\u03b2 can bypass the requirements of Btk and PLC\u03b32 for B cell discrimination of substrate stiffness. Mechanistically, we excluded PKC\u03b2-mediated NF-\u03baB activation in the capability of B cells to discriminate substrate stiffness. Instead, we provide evidence that PKC\u03b2-dependent activation of FAK is required for B cells to discriminate substrate stiffness, whereby FAK potentiates B cell spreading and adhesion responses. As supporting evidence for this model, we observed that a pharmaceutical inhibitor targeting FAK, the key downstream molecule in integrin signaling, drastically impaired the capability of B cells to discriminate substrate stiffness. FAK-deficient B cells also lost this capacity to discriminate substrate stiffness, which was rescued by exogenous expression of FAK-WT but not the inactivated mutant FAK-Y926F. Further data showed that the \u2018outside-in\u2019 activation of integrin by the adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 or VCAM-1, greatly enhanced the B cell\u2019s capability to discriminate substrate stiffness. Lastly, the capability of B cells to discriminate substrate stiffness could be readily recapitulated in human primary PBMC B cells. It was striking to observe that B cells from RA patients exhibited a disordered and weakened capability to discriminate substrate stiffness in comparison with the healthy controls. Our data dissect the molecular mechanisms whereby B cells discriminate substrate stiffness during B cell activation, and also explicitly determine the contribution of adhesion molecules to such an event. The conclusion that B cells discriminate substrate stiffness through a PKC\u03b2-mediated FAK activation-dependent manner in the initiation of B cell activation improves our understanding of the sophisticated mechanosensing capability of B lymphocytes and provides a potential explanation for the dysregulated activation of auto-reactive B cells in RA patients.

Immune cells called B cells use proteins called B cell receptors on their surface to identify these invaders. When the B cell receptors detect molecules called antigens on the surface of the microbes, they produce signals that activate the B cell and enable it to combat the infection. Previous research has found that B cells react differently to antigens depending on the stiffness of the surface to which an antigen is attached. Now, Shaheen, Wan, Li et al. have attached antigens to artificial surfaces that were either stiff or soft and examined how B cells responded to them. Some of the B cells were modified to lack particular molecules that are important for B cell receptor signaling. The results of the experiments suggest that two signaling molecules \u2013 called protein kinase C beta ( PKC\u03b2 ) and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) \u2013 enable B cells to distinguish between the stiffness of different surfaces. PKC\u03b2 activates FAK, which causes the B cell to spread onto the surface and stick to it. However, B cells that had an inactive version of FAK \u2013 or lacked the protein entirely \u2013 did not efficiently spread onto the surfaces and were less able to discriminate between stiff and soft surfaces. In autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, B cells are overactive and attack the body\u2019s own cells. Shaheen et al. found that the B cells of people with rheumatoid arthritis are less able to distinguish between stiff and soft surfaces than normal cells. Further research that investigates how to change the ability of a B cell to detect stiffness could therefore help researchers to develop treatments or vaccines for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions ."}

It exerts its function, at least in part, through repressing genes associated with epigenetic modification and cell differentiation. Here, we show that this repressive function is mediated through an ETO-family co-repressor Mtgr1, which tightly binds to the pre-SET/SET domains of Prdm14 and co-occupies its genomic targets in mouse ESCs. We generated two monobodies, synthetic binding proteins, targeting the Prdm14 SET domain and demonstrate their utility, respectively, in facilitating crystallization and structure determination of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, or as genetically encoded inhibitor of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction. Structure-guided point mutants and the monobody abrogated the Prdm14-Mtgr1 association and disrupted Prdm14's function in mESC gene expression and PGC formation in vitro. Altogether, our work uncovers the molecular mechanism underlying Prdm14-mediated repression and provides renewable reagents for studying and controlling Prdm14 functions.  Prdm14 is a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator that plays key roles in promoting primordial germ cell ( PGC ) specification and safeguarding pluripotency of embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) ( Nakaki and Saitou, 2014 ). During mouse embryogenesis, Prdm14 is expressed in preimplantation embryos, where its asymmetric expression promotes allocation of cells toward the pluripotent inner cell mass ( ICM ) fate ( Burton et al., 2013; Nakaki and Saitou, 2014 ). Prdm14 expression ceases in postimplantation epiblast cells and their differentiated progeny. However, during PGC specification from the epiblast, cells reacquire many transcriptional and epigenetic characteristics of the preimplantation state, and Prdm14 is re-expressed along with several other pluripotency-associated factors ( reviewed in [Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir and Surani, 2014; Saitou et al., 2012] ). The loss of Prdm14 in mice results in sterility associated with early germ cell deficiency, as cells fated to become PGCs fail to reacquire expression of key pluripotency factors and undergo epigenetic reprogramming ( Yamaji et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, overexpression of Prdm14 in epiblast-like cells ( EpiLCs ) is sufficient to induce PGCs in vitro ( albeit with low frequency ), suggesting a central role of Prdm14 in the mouse PGC regulatory network ( Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir et al., 2013; Nakaki et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, Prdm14 is repressed in normal somatic tissues but is aberrantly reactivated in human malignancies of various tissue origin, including leukemias and lymphomas, breast, testicular, and lung cancers ( Carofino et al., 2013; Dettman et al., 2011; Nishikawa et al., 2007; Ruark et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013 ). Given the poor accessibility and transient nature of preimplantation embryo cells and PGCs in vivo, mechanistic studies of Prdm14 function in early development have been chiefly conducted in the context of mouse ESCs ( mESCs ). These cells represent a so-called 'na\u00efve' pluripotent state, thought to resemble preimplantation embryo ICM and serve as a useful system for understanding early cell fate decisions ( Nichols and Smith, 2009 ). Loss of Prdm14 destabilizes mESCs and sensitizes them to differentiation stimuli, leading to acquisition of alternative embryonic states, such as the postimplantation epiblast state or extraembryonic endoderm state, and eventual depletion of the na\u00efve cell subpopulation ( Ma et al., 2011; Yamaji et al., 2013 ). The differentiation in Prdm14\u2212/\u2212 cells is thought to result from upregulation of signaling pathways such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) pathway and by widespread DNA hypermethylation ( Grabole et al., 2013; Hackett et al., 2013; Leitch et al., 2013 ). Indeed, genome-wide Prdm14 occupancy studies by chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) suggest that these are direct effects of the loss of Prdm14, as Prdm14 occupies and represses the regulatory elements of genes involved in FGFR signaling and de novo DNA methylation ( Leitch et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2011; Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir et al., 2013; Yamaji et al., 2013 ). Nonetheless, Prdm14\u2212/\u2212 mESCs can be maintained indefinitely under 2i conditions ( Grabole et al., 2013; Payer et al., 2013; Yamaji et al., 2013 ), in which differentiation stimuli, including FGFR signaling, are chemically inhibited, providing an opportunity to study the early effects of Prdm14 deficiency upon release from such inhibition. Although the cellular and molecular phenotypes associated with loss of Prdm14 in mESCs have been well characterized, much less is known about molecular mechanisms and partners through which Prdm14 acts. As a member of the PRDM family, Prdm14 contains both a zinc-finger array, responsible for sequence-dependent DNA binding ( Ma et al., 2011 ), and a PR domain that is related to the SET domain ( Su ( var ) 3\u20139, Enhancer-of-zeste and Trithorax ) ( Fog et al., 2012; Hohenauer and Moore, 2012 ). Many SET domains harbor methyltransferase activity for either histone or non-histone substrates ( Del Rizzo and Trievel, 2011 ). However, to date, no enzymatic activity has been reported for Prdm14, and interestingly multiple members of the PRDM family appear to be catalytically inactive. Instead, candidate-based co-immunoprecipitation studies implicated Polycomb complex PRC2 as a mediator of Prdm14-dependent repression ( Chan et al., 2013; Yamaji et al., 2013 ). Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether PRC2 is a major or auxiliary partner of Prdm14, and what other molecular players are important for Prdm14's function. To address these questions, we used an unbiased biochemical approach to uncover major Prdm14-associated proteins in mESCs. We identified an ETO-family corepressor, myeloid translocation gene related 1 ( Mtgr1, a. k. a. Mtg8r, Cbfa2t2, and Zmynd3 ), as a direct, stoichiometric partner of Prdm14. We demonstrate that Mtgr1 co-occupies Prdm14 target loci, and its deletion in mESCs results in phenotypes and gene expression defects similar to those observed upon loss of Prdm14. Moreover, Mtgr1 knockout cells show impaired induction of PGC-like cells in vitro. To further facilitate studies of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, we mapped interaction domains and developed multiple synthetic binding proteins, termed monobodies, that specifically recognize the SET domain of Prdm14 in a manner independent of, or alternatively, competitive with Mtgr1. Taking advantage of the stabilizing effect of one such monobody, we obtained a crystal structure of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, revealing an extensive interface and electrostatic interactions mediating the association of the two proteins. Furthermore, structure-guided mutagenesis of the interface and the use of an inhibitory monobody demonstrated the function of the complex in safeguarding pluripotency and PGC-like cell induction. Altogether, we report a multi-disciplinary study that advances our understanding of Prdm14 function, identifying Mtgr1 as the major partner of Prdm14 in its roles in pluripotency and PGC induction, and providing the community with renewable, genetically encoded reagents that can be used both in vitro and in vivo to study and control Prdm14 function in development and malignancy.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: In animals, there are many different types of cells that perform different roles. For example, stem cells divide to produce new cells that may then become other types of cells such as muscle or skin cells. Most stem cells can only produce a limited range of other cell types, except for a subset known as \u2018pluripotent\u2019 stem cells that can give rise to cells of any type in the body. A protein called Prdm14 helps to keep stem cells in a pluripotent state. In mouse embryos, Prdm14 binds to and represses particular genes that promote a process by which the stem cells can change into other cell types. If Prdm14 is missing from pluripotent stem cells, these cells become more sensitive to signals that encourage them to become other types of cells, which can lead to the loss of pluripotency. Prdm14 contains a region called the SET domain. In other proteins, this domain can alter how DNA is packaged to help switch particular genes on or off. However, such activity has not been found for the SET domain of Prdm14, raising questions about how it actually works. Here, Nady, Gupta et al. show that Prdm14 tightly interacts with a protein called Mtgr1, which belongs to a family of proteins known to be involved in leukemia. The loss of Mtgr1 also leads to the loss of pluripotency in mouse stem cells and disrupts the formation of reproductive stem cells. Furthermore, Mtgr1 binds to the same genes as Prdm14. Next, Nady, Gupta et al. made synthetic proteins, termed monobodies, that bind to the Prdm14 SET domain. One such monobody enabled the authors to determine the three-dimensional structure of Prdm1 and Mtgr1, which revealed that the SET domain of Prdm14 has many points of contact with Mtgr1. Importantly, interaction between the two partners is crucial for these proteins to maintain pluripotency and promote the production of reproductive stem cells. Altogether, these findings identify Mtgr1 as a key binding partner of Prdm14 in pluripotent stem cells and uncover a role for the SET domain in this interaction. A future challenge will be to understand the roles of these proteins in leukemia and other diseases ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe re-assembly of chromatin following DNA replication is a critical event in the maintenance of genome integrity. Histone H3 acetylation at K56 and phosphorylation at T45 are two important chromatin modifications that accompany chromatin assembly. Here we have identified the protein kinase Pkc1 as a key regulator that coordinates the deposition of these modifications in S. cerevisiae under conditions of replicative stress. Pkc1 phosphorylates the histone acetyl transferase Rtt109 and promotes its ability to acetylate H3K56. Our data also reveal novel cross-talk between two different histone modifications as Pkc1 also enhances H3T45 phosphorylation and this modification is required for H3K56 acetylation. Our data therefore uncover an important role for Pkc1 in coordinating the deposition of two different histone modifications that are important for chromatin assembly.  During the cell cycle one of the key processes following DNA replication is the re-assembly of chromatin on the newly replicated DNA. This involves the re-deposition of both pre-existing and newly synthesised histones into intact nucleosomes ( reviewed in Groth et al., 2007; Ransom et al., 2010; Gurard-Levin et al., 2014 ). This process must be tightly controlled and in S. cerevisiae one key event is the Rtt109-mediated modification of histone H3 by acetylation of lysine 56 ( H3K56 ) ( Han et al., 2007; Driscoll et al., 2007 ). Rtt109 cooperates with two different histone chaperones Asf1 and Vps75 ( Tsubota et al., 2007; Driscoll et al., 2007 ) and although it is generally accepted that Asf1 is the major chaperone involved in promoting H3K56 acetylation ( Keck et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2011 ), recent evidence suggests a role for Vps75 in this process ( Radovani et al., 2013 ). However, the signalling pathways controlling Rtt109-mediated H3K56 acetylation are unknown. Another important modification that occurs coincidentally with DNA replication is H3 phosphorylation at threonine T45 ( H3T45 ) but current evidence suggests that this modification has no relationship with the closely located H3K56 acetylation event ( Baker et al., 2010 ). In the context of an unperturbed cell cycle, Cdc7-Dbf4 has been shown to be a major kinase involved in controlling H3T45 phosphorylation levels ( Baker et al., 2010 ). S. cerevisiae possesses one protein kinase C isoform, Pkc1, and it is known to play a major role in cell wall integrity signalling ( reviewed in Levin, 2005 ). Pkc1 has a growing number of nuclear functions and through genetic experiments this protein kinase has previously been implicated in cell cycle events ( reviewed in Levin, 2005 ). Part of this role can be attributed to its connection to pathways sensing cell wall integrity and its effects on the activity of the downstream MAP kinase pathway. However MAP kinase-independent roles for Pkc1 have emerged and Pkc1 was recently shown to directly affect the cell cycle by inhibiting the activity of the transcriptional coactivator protein Ndd1 ( Darieva et al., 2012 ). This finding suggested that Pkc1p might act as a checkpoint kinase under conditions of replicative stress where progression to G2 phase is inhibited. However, mutant strains containing ndd1 mutant alleles lacking the Pkc1 phosphorylation sites did not fully re-capitulate the pkc1 mutant phenotypes, indicating that additional defects are associated with loss of Pkc1 activity. Indeed, pkc1 mutants are sensitive to hydroxurea ( HU ) treatment ( Queralt and Igual, 2005 ), suggesting a potential role for Pkc1 in controlling the response to replicative stress. It is unclear how Pkc1 might affect replicative stress but previous genetic studies have linked PKC1 and components of the RSC chromatin remodelling complex and Pkc1 overexpression can suppress the defects associated with RSC mutants ( Chai et al., 2005; Hosotani et al., 2001; reviewed in Levin et al., 2005 ). This is suggestive of a potential role for Pkc1 in regulating chromatin assembly during DNA replication. Here, we have investigated the potential role of Pkc1 in controlling chromatin modifications during replicative stress and found that it coordinates the deposition of two histone marks on histone H3, T45 phosphorylation and K56 acetylation. Mechanistically, Pkc1 controls H3K56 acetylation through phosphorylation-dependent activation of Rtt109. Moreover, Pkc1 also promotes H3T45 phosphorylation and this modification is important for the coordinated deposition of H3K56 acetylation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Prior to cell division, DNA must be copied so that each new cell gets a complete copy of the cell\u2019s genetic instructions. But DNA is so long that it is stored in a heavily compacted form in the nucleus of the cell, with the strands of DNA coiled around several proteins called histones. Before the DNA is copied, it must be unfurled. Then each new copy of DNA must be repackaged to fit compactly inside the nucleus of each new cell. If errors occur in the process of copying DNA, it can lead to genetic mutations that may cause diseases like cancer. To prevent this, cells have mechanisms to identify errors and correct them before the DNA is repackaged. This requires a pause to allow the repairs to occur before the DNA recoils. However, it is not completely clear how this process is controlled. Now, Darieva et al. show that an enzyme called protein kinase C ( or Pkc1 for short ) is essential to repackaging DNA after the errors are corrected. Several experiments showed that Pkc1 plays an important role when cells were exposed to stressful conditions that potentially cause errors in DNA copying. Specifically, Pkc1 helps prepare the third histone protein ( histone H3 ) so that DNA can recoil around it. Pkc1 waits until the stressful conditions have passed and the DNA has been repaired to make the necessary changes. Once the stress has passed, Pkc1 adds a phosphate to another enzyme called Rtt109 that prepares the histone. The Pkc1 simultaneously contributes to another necessary change to histone H3. These new details about DNA repackaging may help researchers understand how cells protect against DNA copying errors, and how this process goes wrong in cancer ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nGenomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon causing parent-of-origin specific differential expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles. While many imprinted genes have been identified in plants, the functional roles of most of them are unknown. In this study, we systematically examine the functional requirement of paternally expressed imprinted genes ( PEGs ) during seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana. While none of the 15 analyzed peg mutants has qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of seed development, we identify three PEGs that establish postzygotic hybridization barriers in the endosperm, revealing that PEGs have a major role as speciation genes in plants. Our work reveals that a subset of PEGs maintains functional roles in the inbreeding plant Arabidopsis that become evident upon deregulated expression.  Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon occurring in mammals and flowering plants that leads to parent-of-origin specific differential expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles ( Gehring, 2013 ). Recent screening of the seed transcriptome in various plant species revealed dozens to several hundreds of novel candidate imprinted genes in maize, rice, castor bean, and Arabidopsis thaliana ( Gehring et al., 2011; Hsieh et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2011; Waters et al., 2011; Wolff et al., 2011; Pignatta et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014 ). While few reports demonstrate genes to be temporally imprinted in the plant embryo ( Jahnke and Scholten, 2009; Raissig et al., 2013 ), the vast majority of imprinted genes has been observed in the endosperm, the ephemeral triploid tissue derived after fertilization of the diploid central cell with a haploid sperm cell. In most angiosperms the endosperm initially develops as a syncytium and cellularizes after a defined number of mitotic divisions ( Li and Berger, 2012 ). The right timing of endosperm cellularization is crucial for proper seed development, its failure results in deficient nutrient supply, which causes embryo arrest and eventually seed abortion ( Hehenberger et al., 2012 ). In Arabidopsis, endosperm cellularization is regulated by, among others, the type I MADS-box transcription factor AGL62. Loss of AGL62 leads to precocious endosperm cellularization ( Kang et al., 2008 ), whereas increased AGL62 expression correlates with delayed or failed cellularization ( Erilova et al., 2009; Tiwari et al., 2010 ). Similar effects on endosperm development have been observed in response to interploidy hybridizations. While maternal excess hybridizations cause precocious endosperm cellularization and reduced seed size, the reciprocal cross leads to endosperm cellularization failure and seed abortion in an accession-dependent frequency ( Scott et al., 1998; Dilkes et al., 2008 ). This phenomenon establishes a postzygotic reproductive barrier by preventing the formation of viable triploid seeds and has been termed \u2018triploid block\u2019 ( Marks, 1966 ). Dosage-sensitivity of the endosperm has been proposed to be a consequence of deregulated imprinted genes that are responsible for interploidy hybridization failure ( Haig and Westoby, 1989; Gutierrez-Marcos et al., 2003; Kinoshita, 2007 ). Indeed, in response to interploidy hybridizations many imprinted genes are deregulated ( Jullien and Berger, 2010; Tiwari et al., 2010; Wolff et al., 2011 ) and the paternally expressed imprinted gene ADMETOS ( ADM ) has been identified to be a causative gene responsible for abortion of triploid seeds upon paternal excess hybridizations in Arabidopsis ( Kradolfer et al., 2013 ). While the identification of ADM provided first evidence that imprinted genes can establish reproductive barriers, the question whether this is a more general phenomenon applying to other imprinted genes as well, remained unresolved. In this study we investigated the functional role of 15 PEGs during seed development in Arabidopsis. None of the analyzed peg mutants caused qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of diploid seed development, revealing that many PEGs do either not have an important functional role in Arabidopsis seeds or act redundantly with non-imprinted genes. However, 3 out of ten tested peg mutants rescued triploid seed abortion, uncovering a major role of PEGs in establishing postzygotic interploidy hybridization barriers.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: When plants and animals reproduce sexually, their offspring inherit two copies of every gene, one from each parent, which are arranged in two sets of structures called chromosomes. In some tissues, one gene copy may be switched off\u2014through a process called \u2018genomic imprinting\u2019\u2014while the other copy remains active. In plants, genomic imprinting is vital for seeds to develop normally. It is particularly important in the tissue that provides nutrients for the growing embryo ( the endosperm ), in which one of the copies of many genes are switched off. Genes inherited from the male parent that have been imprinted are known as paternally expressed imprinted genes ( PEGs ). Unlike most animals, it is common for plants to have more than two sets of chromosomes. When plants with different numbers of chromosome sets cross-fertilize each other, their offspring may have three copies of every gene instead of two. These \u2018triploid\u2019 seeds often die because their endosperm fails to develop normally. This is due to the increased activity of imprinted genes, which causes changes in the activity of many other genes in the endosperm. Although it is known that genomic imprinting in the endosperm helps to establish this reproductive barrier, it is not clear what specific roles many of the imprinted genes play. Here, Wolff et al. switched off several different PEGs in the plant Arabidopsis to investigate how they affect seed development. The experiments show that in seeds that have the normal two copies of every gene, inactivating these imprinted genes does not affect seed development. However, in triploid seeds, inactivating three of the imprinted genes rescues seeds that would normally die. These genes encode proteins that activate pathways in the endosperm that promote the formation of cell walls, which is a crucial stage in seed development. Wolff et al. 's findings reveal how imprinted genes in the endosperm establish a barrier to reproduction by preventing seeds produced from crosses between plants with different numbers of chromosome sets from being able to survive. Reproductive barriers are a major obstacle in plant breeding, so understanding how these barriers form may open new avenues for developing new plant varieties ."}

To enable a new generation of anti-viral vaccines, we designed self-assembling protein nanoparticles with geometries tailored to present the ectodomains of influenza, HIV, and RSV viral glycoprotein trimers. We first de novo designed trimers tailored for antigen fusion, featuring N-terminal helices positioned to match the C termini of the viral glycoproteins. Trimers that experimentally adopted their designed configurations were incorporated as components of tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticles, which were characterized by cryo-electron microscopy and assessed for their ability to present viral glycoproteins. Electron microscopy and antibody binding experiments demonstrated that the designed nanoparticles presented antigenically intact prefusion HIV-1 Env, influenza hemagglutinin, and RSV F trimers in the predicted geometries. This work demonstrates that antigen-displaying protein nanoparticles can be designed from scratch, and provides a systematic way to investigate the influence of antigen presentation geometry on the immune response to vaccination.  Multivalent antigen presentation, in which antigens are presented to the immune system in a repetitive array, has been demonstrated to increase the potency of humoral immune responses ( Bennett et al., 2015; Snapper, 2018 ). This has been attributed to increased cross-linking of antigen-specific B cell receptors at the cell surface and modulation of immunogen trafficking to and within lymph nodes ( Irvine et al., 2013; Tokatlian et al., 2019 ). An ongoing challenge has been to develop multimerization scaffolds capable of presenting complex oligomeric or engineered antigens ( Sanders and Moore, 2017; Jardine et al., 2013; McLellan et al., 2013a ), as these can be difficult to stably incorporate into non-protein-based nanomaterials ( e. g. liposomes, polymers, transition metals and their oxides ). Epitope accessibility, proper folding of the antigen, and stability are also important considerations in any strategy for antigen presentation. Several reports have utilized non-viral, naturally occurring protein scaffolds, such as self-assembling ferritin ( Kanekiyo et al., 2013; Sliepen et al., 2015; Darricarr\u00e8re et al., 2018 ), lumazine synthase ( Sanders and Moore, 2017; Abbott et al., 2018 ), or encapsulin ( Kanekiyo et al., 2015 ) nanoparticles, to present a variety of complex oligomeric or engineered antigens. These studies have illustrated the advantages of using self-assembling proteins as scaffolds for antigen presentation ( L\u00f3pez-Sagaseta et al., 2016; Kanekiyo et al., 2019 ), including enhanced immunogenicity and seamless integration of antigen and scaffold through genetic fusion. More recently, computationally designed one- and two-component protein nanoparticles ( Hsia et al., 2016; King et al., 2014; Bale et al., 2016 ) have been used to present complex oligomeric antigens, conferring additional advantages such as high stability, robust assembly, ease of production and purification, and increased potency upon immunization ( Marcandalli et al., 2019; Brouwer et al., 2019 ). The ability to predictively explore new structural space makes designed proteins ( Parmeggiani et al., 2015; Brunette et al., 2015 ) attractive scaffolds for multivalent antigen presentation. In our previous work with computationally designed nanoparticle immunogens ( Marcandalli et al., 2019; Brouwer et al., 2019 ), the nanoparticles were generated from naturally occurring oligomeric proteins without initial consideration of geometric compatibility for antigen presentation. A more comprehensive solution would be to de novo design nanoparticles which present complex antigens of interest. For homo-oligomeric class I viral fusion proteins, a large group that includes many important vaccine antigens ( Harrison, 2015 ), a close geometric match between the C termini of the antigen and the N termini of a designed nanoparticle component would enable multivalent presentation without structural distortion near the glycoprotein base, and potentially allow for better retention of antigenic epitopes relevant to protection. More generally, precise control of antigen presentation geometry through de novo nanoparticle design would enable systematic investigation of the structural determinants of immunogenicity.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Vaccines train the immune system to recognize a specific virus or bacterium so that the body can be better prepared against these harmful agents. To do so, many vaccines contain viral molecules called glycoproteins, which are specific to each type of virus. Glycoproteins that sit at the surface of the virus can act as \u2018keys\u2019 that recognize and unlock the cells of certain organisms, leading to viral infection. To ensure a stronger immune response, glycoproteins in vaccines are often arranged on a protein scaffold which can mimic the shape of the virus of interest and trigger a strong immune response. Many scaffolds, however, are currently made from natural proteins which cannot always display viral glycoproteins. Here, Ueda, Antanasijevic et al. developed a method that allows for the design of artificial proteins which can serve as scaffold for viral glycoproteins. This approach was tested using three viruses: influenza, HIV, and RSV \u2013 a virus responsible for bronchiolitis. The experiments showed that in each case, the relevant viral glycoproteins could attach themselves to the scaffold. These structures could then assemble themselves into vaccine particles with predicted geometrical shapes, which mimicked the virus and maximized the response from the immune system. Designing artificial scaffold for viral glycoproteins gives greater control over vaccine design, allowing scientists to manipulate the shape of vaccine particles and test the impact on the immune response. Ultimately, the approach developed by Ueda, Antanasijevic et al. could lead to vaccines that are more efficient and protective, including against viruses for which there is currently no suitable scaffold ."}

A recent epidemic in the Indian subcontinent ( ISC ) caused up to 80% of global VL and over 30, 000 deaths per year. Resistance against antimonial drugs has probably been a contributing factor in the persistence of this epidemic. Here we use whole genome sequences from 204 clinical isolates to track the evolution and epidemiology of L. donovani from the ISC. We identify independent radiations that have emerged since a bottleneck coincident with 1960s DDT spraying campaigns. A genetically distinct population frequently resistant to antimonials has a two base-pair insertion in the aquaglyceroporin gene LdAQP1 that prevents the transport of trivalent antimonials. We find evidence of genetic exchange between ISC populations, and show that the mutation in LdAQP1 has spread by recombination. Our results reveal the complexity of L. donovani evolution in the ISC in response to drug treatment.  Parasites of the Leishmania donovani species complex cause visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ), the most severe presentation of leishmaniasis that is usually fatal if untreated. There are probably between 200, 000 and 300, 000 VL cases annually ( Alvar et al., 2012 ), leading to as many as 50, 000 deaths per year ( den Boer et al., 2011; Lozano et al., 2012 ). VL is widespread in both the New and Old Worlds ( Pigott et al., 2014 ), but as much as 80% of the global VL burden occurs in the Indian sub-continent ( Alvar et al., 2012 ). Recent intensified control efforts have led to a notable decline in cases ( Chowdhury et al., 2014 ) but the problem is not yet eliminated. VL is a key neglected tropical disease, affecting the poorest regions of the world and the poorest communities within these regions ( Boelaert et al., 2009 ). VL was first reported in the Indian sub-continent ( ISC ) in the 1820s, but initially confused with malaria until the discovery of L. donovani in 1903 ( Gibson, 1983 ). Although VL was nearly eliminated from the ISC in the 1960s ( Thakur, 2007 ) by antimalarial spraying campaigns with DDT, it re-emerged in 1977 and has caused several subsequent major epidemics ( Dye and Wolpert, 1988 ). Widespread chemotherapy for VL in the region has been ongoing since the 1820s, initially with quinine and other drugs, followed by extensive use of the trivalent antimonial SbIII ( 1915 ) and compounds of the less toxic pentavalent SbV ( 1922 ) such as sodium stibogluconate ( SSG ), and since 2005 with miltefosine ( MIL ) that is freely supplied through a government-subsidized control program. The parasite developed resistance to both SbIII and SbV, and after ten years of clinical use there has been a notable decline in MIL efficacy ( Rijal et al., 2013; 2007; Sundar et al., 2012 ). Leishmania parasites can re-shape their genome rapidly in vitro in response to stress ( Leprohon et al., 2009 ), suggesting structural variation is an important feature by which they can rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions and drug pressure. However, there is little data on the diversity of clinical Leishmania populations or how they evolve during treatment. While an extensive literature has made use of molecular methods to study the population genetics of Leishmania ( e. g. Alam et al., 2009; Lukes et al., 2007; Mauricio et al., 2006; Schonian et al., 2008 ), existing genetic markers have relatively poor resolution, and in particular L. donovani within the ISC show very little genetic differentiation based on these approaches ( Alam et al., 2009; Downing et al., 2012 ). Whole-genome sequence data has the potential to show significant population structure within the ISC, and also allows us to identify changes in genome structure. Here we report the genome sequences of 204\u2009L. donovani isolates ( Figure 1, Supplementary file 1 ), obtained from VL patients between 2002 and 2011 from regions in Nepal ( N=98 ), India ( N=98 ) and Bangladesh ( N=8 ) that represent the epicentre of the on-going VL epidemic in the ISC ( Figure 1a ). 10. 7554/eLife. 12613. 003Figure 1.

Around half a million new cases develop every year, but health authorities lack safe and effective drugs to treat them. Up to 80% of these cases occur in the Indian subcontinent, where devastating epidemics have occurred in the last decades. One reason these epidemics continue to occur is that the parasites develop genetic mutations allowing them to adapt to and resist the drugs used to kill them. As there are few existing drugs that can kill L. donovani, it is crucial to understand how drug resistance emerges and spreads among parasite populations. Imamura, Downing, Van den Broeck et al. have now investigated the history of visceral leishmaniasis epidemics by characterising the complete genetic sequence \u2013 or genome \u2013 of 204 L. donovani parasite samples. This revealed that the majority of parasites in the Indian subcontinent first appeared in the nineteenth century, matching the first historical records of visceral leishmaniasis epidemics. The genomes show that most of the parasites are genetically similar and can be clustered into several closely related groups. These groups first appeared in the 1960s following the end of a regional campaign to eradicate malaria. The most common parasite group is particularly resistant to drugs called antimonials, which were the main treatment for leishmaniasis until recently. These parasites have a small genetic change that scrambles most of a protein known to be involved in the uptake of antimonials. Parasites may also be able to develop resistance to drugs through additional mechanisms that allow them to produce many copies of the same gene. These mechanisms could allow the parasites to rapidly adapt to new drugs or changes in the populations it infects. The work of Imamura et al. looks only at parasites isolated from patients then grown in the laboratory, so further research is now needed to explore how variable the Leishmania genome is in both of the parasite\u2019s hosts: humans and sandflies. Imamura et al. \u2019s study reveals how L. donovani has spread throughout the Indian subcontinent in fine detail. The genome data can be used to create simple molecular tools that could form an \"early warning system\" to track the success of disease control programs and to determine how well the current drugs are working ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nHow dietary selection affects genome evolution to define the optimal range of nutrient intake is a poorly understood question with medical relevance. We have addressed this question by analyzing Drosophila simulans and sechellia, recently diverged species with differential diet choice. D. sechellia larvae, specialized to a nutrient scarce diet, did not survive on sugar-rich conditions, while the generalist species D. simulans was sugar tolerant. Sugar tolerance in D. simulans was a tradeoff for performance on low-energy diet and was associated with global reprogramming of metabolic gene expression. Hybridization and phenotype-based introgression revealed the genomic regions of D. simulans that were sufficient for sugar tolerance. These regions included genes that are involved in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and intracellular signaling, such as PPP1R15/Gadd34 and SERCA, which contributed to sugar tolerance. In conclusion, genomic variation affecting genes involved in global metabolic control defines the optimal range for dietary macronutrient composition.  Animals require macronutrients to sustain growth, reproduction and repair over their lifetimes and the balance between nutrients has been shown to have significant effects on development, reproduction and longevity ( Raubenheimer and Simpson, 1997; Lee et al., 2008; Arganda et al., 2017 ). Most animals consume a variety of different foods to meet their nutritional needs ( Raubenheimer and Simpson, 1997; Lee et al., 2008 ) and even closely related species make highly distinct diet choices ( Tinker et al., 2008; Goldman-Huertas et al., 2015; Salinas-Ramos et al., 2015; Costello et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016 ). Therefore, it is conceivable that the impact of nutrient composition on various life history traits depends on the genetic makeup of the animal. Some closely related species are distinguished by variation in morphological structures that are specialized for obtaining nutrients from unique resources ( trophic morphology ) ( Malinsky et al., 2015; Parsons et al., 2016; Santana and Cheung, 2016 ). Darwin\u2019s finches are the classic example of species that are differentiated in part by interspecific competition and specialization on an under-used food type ( De Le\u00f3n et al., 2014 ). Darwin\u2019s finches are considered \u2018imperfect dietary generalists\u2019 ( De Le\u00f3n et al., 2014 ) having similar preferred diets that overlap among species but specialize on a unique food when the preferred diet is limiting. Such difference in diet flexibility suggests that in addition to morphological differences, animals might also display differential metabolic flexibility, that\u00a0is the capacity to adapt nutrient use to nutrient availability. While much recent attention has been paid to the genetics that underlie plasticity of trophic morphology in animals ( Malinsky et al., 2015; Ledogar et al., 2016; McGirr and Martin, 2017; Burress et al., 2017; Zelditch et al., 2017 ), less focus has been placed on metabolic regulators with regard to diet choice ( Turner and Thompson, 2013 ). Metabolic phenotypes and diet tolerance is observed to vary with ecological diversification within and between species ( Matzkin et al., 2009; Reed et al., 2010; Matzkin et al., 2011 ), and these phenotypic changes correlate with changes in gene expression ( Nazario-Yepiz et al., 2017 ). However, it remains poorly understood, which genetic changes are causally important during evolution of diet choice and what kind of metabolic tradeoffs might emerge from adaptation to a new macronutrient composition. Flexibility in the usage of metabolic pathways allows animals to accommodate changes in food nutrient content and availability. At the level of the organism, systemic nutrient levels are actively monitored by the\u00a0so-called nutrient-sensing pathways composed of intra- and intercellular signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks, which ultimately control the activity of metabolic pathways ( Mattila and Hietakangas, 2017 ). There are specific nutrient-sensing mechanisms for each type of macronutrient. For example, protein kinases mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) and GCN2 respond to changes in amino acid availability ( Efeyan et al., 2015 ), while the transcription factor complex Mondo/ChREBP-Mlx is activated in response to sugars ( Havula and Hietakangas, 2012 ). In Drosophila, genetic mutations that impair nutrient-sensing pathways have revealed diet-specific phenotypes. Adult mutants of 4EBP, a target of mTORC1, are indistinguishable from controls when fed a protein-rich diet, but are sensitive to amino acid starvation ( Teleman et al., 2005 ). On the other hand, mlx mutant larvae have impaired function of the sugar sensor Mondo/ChREBP-Mlx and grow normally when fed a low sugar diet ( LSD ), but are intolerant of high-sugar diet ( HSD ) ( Havula et al., 2013 ). The mlx null mutants exhibit impaired growth, increased larval development time and reduced larvae to pupae survival when the high dietary sugar concentration is within the range available from natural food sources ( Havula et al., 2013 ). Thus, nutrient-sensing pathways define the tolerated lower and upper limits of nutrient intake. These limits for each nutrient will further depend on the availability of other nutrients. We call the inclusive matrix of tolerated macronutrient contents the \u2018macronutrient space\u2019. Here, we aimed to explore the natural variation of macronutrient space in closely related species. We hypothesized that the natural variation of diet choice as well as diet flexibility ( specialist vs. generalist ) is affected by genetically\u00a0encoded differences that define the macronutrient space. To test this hypothesis, we studied two closely related Drosophila species that differ in diet choice, namely the generalist D. simulans and its specialist relative, D. sechellia. In nature, D. simulans larvae consume a range of decaying fruits that may contain high levels of sugars, whereas D. sechellia larvae grow on the unripe fruits of Morinda citrifolia, which has a low-sugar content ( Singh et al., 2012 ). The two species occur together on islands of the Seychelles archipelago; however, D. sechellia adults and larvae are found infrequently on fruits other than that of Morinda ( R'Kha et al., 1991; Matute and Ayroles, 2014 ). D. simulans and D. sechellia show strong dietary differentiation yet they are closely related and can form fertile female F1 hybrids ( Lachaise et al., 1986 ). This makes the two species and their hybrids a tractable system for studying the genetics associated with determination of macronutrient space.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Animals meet their nutritional needs in a variety of ways. Some animals are specialists feeding only on one type of food; others are generalists that can choose many different kinds of food depending on the situation. Despite these differences in diet, animals have similar needs for basic cellular metabolism. This suggests that generalist and specialist species likely process the foods they eat in different ways in order to meet their basic needs. For example, the metabolism of generalist species may be more flexible to adapt to changing food sources. To learn more about how metabolism evolves to respond to diet, scientists can study closely related species that eat different foods. For example, a species of fruit fly called Drosophila simulans is a generalist and its larvae can grow and develop by feeding on different kinds of decaying fruits and vegetables. Larvae of a closely related fruit fly called Drosophila sechellia are specialized to eat only the nutrient-poor Morinda fruit. Looking at how genetic differences between these species affect metabolism may provide scientists with clues about how these feeding strategies evolved. Melvin et al. grew larvae of D. sechellia and D. simulans in different conditions. D. sechellia larvae thrived in low nutrient conditions, but died when exposed to high sugar foods. By contrast, D. simulans larvae tolerated high sugar levels, but did poorly in low-nutrient conditions. Melvin et al. then bred the two species with each other, selecting flies that are genetically similar to D. sechellia but have the genes necessary for larvae to tolerate sugar. Analyzing the selected hybrid flies revealed genetic changes that explain the different survival abilities of each species. These changes suggest that D. sechellia rapidly evolved to thrive in low nutrient conditions, but the trade-off was losing their ability to tolerate high sugar levels. Overall, the results presented by Melvin et al. suggest that genetic adaptions to food sources can occur quickly and drastically change metabolism. Further research will be needed to confirm if similar metabolic trade-offs developed as part of human evolution. If so, human populations that survived with limited nutrition for many generations may have a harder time adapting to high-sugar modern diets ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nWe use the myotendinous junction of Drosophila flight muscles to explore why many integrin associated proteins ( IAPs ) are needed and how their function is coordinated. These muscles revealed new functions for IAPs not required for viability: Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ), RSU1, tensin and vinculin. Genetic interactions demonstrated a balance between positive and negative activities, with vinculin and tensin positively regulating adhesion, while FAK inhibits elevation of integrin activity by tensin, and RSU1 keeps PINCH activity in check. The molecular composition of myofibril termini resolves into 4 distinct layers, one of which is built by a mechanotransduction cascade: vinculin facilitates mechanical opening of filamin, which works with the Arp2/3 activator WASH to build an actin-rich layer positioned between integrins and the first sarcomere. Thus, integration of IAP activity is needed to build the complex architecture of the myotendinous junction, linking the membrane anchor to the sarcomere.  Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is essential for the development and homeostasis of multiple cell types and tissues ( Winograd-Katz et al., 2014 ). Adhesion to the ECM is primarily mediated by integrins, \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimeric transmembrane receptors. The medical importance of integrin adhesion is exemplified by the range of human diseases resulting from its loss or misregulation ( Winograd-Katz et al., 2014 ). The extracellular domains of both integrin subunits binds ECM ligands, whereas it is primarily the intracellular domain of the \u03b2 subunit that recruits intracellular integrin-associated proteins ( IAPs ). As \u03b2 subunit cytoplasmic tails lack enzymatic activity and almost all are short ( ~47 residues ) it is the IAPs that mediate integrin signalling and interaction with the actin cytoskeleton ( Campbell and Humphries, 2011 ). Over 150 different proteins have been implicated in integrin adhesion, and 60 are consistently found in adhesions ( Horton et al., 2015 ). We aim to discover why so many proteins are required for the seemingly simple task of linking the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton. Two features of integrin adhesion sites may help explain the complexity of the machinery required: their complex architecture, and their ability to respond to mechanical forces. Super-resolution microscopy of IAPs revealed that focal adhesions in fibroblasts have a complex nano-architecture with distinct layers in the Z-axis: a membrane proximal integrin signalling layer, a force transduction layer and an actin regulatory layer that connects to the actin stress fiber ( Kanchanawong et al., 2010 ). Most IAPs localise to specific layers, but talin spans two layers with its N-terminus in the integrin signalling layer and C-terminus in the force transduction layer. It is not yet known whether a similar nano-architecture is present in stable integrin adhesions within tissues. In Drosophila embryonic muscles talin is orientated similarly to fibroblasts, whereas in the developing wing both ends are close to the membrane ( Klapholz et al., 2015 ). This suggests diverse architectures of integrin adhesion sites, and an additional rationale for the large IAP number. The maturation and stability of focal adhesions in vertebrate cells in culture requires force from actin polymerisation and/or acto-myosin contraction ( Sun et al., 2016 ). Building integrin-mediated attachment sites in muscles during embryogenesis has two phases: the initial attachment phase that does not require myosin-mediated contractions, followed by an increase in IAP levels and stoichiometry changes, as muscles begin contracting ( Bulgakova et al., 2017 ). Such a force-responsive mechanism may ensure adhesion strength is balanced with contractile force. The recruitment of vinculin by talin is a valuable paradigm for how adhesion can be strengthened in response to force, with force-induced stretching of talin unfolding protein domains to reveal binding sites for vinculin, and bound vinculin providing new links to actin ( Klapholz and Brown, 2017 ). A valuable way to assess the contribution of each IAP is to compare the defects that occur when they are genetically removed. The reduced number of paralogs has made this comparison easier in Drosophila. Focusing on integrin function at muscle attachment sites, analogous to myotendinous junctions, all IAPs are present but the consequence of removing IAPs ranges from complete loss of integrin adhesion to no apparent defect ( Bulgakova et al., 2012 ). The loss of some IAPs could be tolerated either because they contribute a minor function not necessary in the laboratory, or due to redundancy between IAPs. To discover how these apparently minor IAPs contribute to integrin adhesion, and test their redundancy, we utilized an integrin adhesion that resists the strenuous activity of flight. Indirect flight muscles ( IFMs ) are the major muscles in the adult thorax that power flight ( Gunage et al., 2017 ). IFMs are more similar to vertebrate muscles than most Drosophila muscles, because IFMs are fibrillar as opposed to tubular muscles such as the adult leg muscle. Fibrillar muscles are made up of myofibers, which in turn contain hundreds of myofibrils. The myofibril sarcomeres are of standard structure, comprising a regular repeating structure of overlapping actin and myosin filaments. Actin filament barbed ends are anchored at Z-lines with their pointed ends towards the center of the sarcomere, while bipolar myosin filaments overlap with actin filaments in the center of the sarcomere and are anchored at M-lines. In the IFMs, sarcomeres form simultaneously along the length of each myofibril during pupal development ( Weitkunat et al., 2014 ) and then elongate by growth from the actin pointed ends, and widen by circumferential addition ( Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler, 2001; Shwartz et al., 2016 ). At the ends of each myofibril are modified terminal Z-lines ( MTZ ), which contain sites of integrin adhesion to the epidermal tendon cell. The myofibril and tendon cell membranes form finger-like protrusions that interdigitate with one another ( hereafter referred to as interdigitations ). The attachment sites in IFMs appear by electron microscopy more complex and larger than those in larval muscles, with\u00a0~1 \u00b5m separating plasma membrane from first sarcomere versus 0. 1\u20130. 5 \u00b5m ( Reedy and Beall, 1993; Tepass and Hartenstein, 1994 ). Furthermore, IFMs contract 200 times per second ( Fry et al., 2003 ), whereas larval muscles contract once every\u00a0~5 s during crawling ( Crisp et al., 2008 ). We use the IFMs to discover functions for four IAPs ( tensin, RSU1, focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and vinculin ) that surprisingly are not needed for viability of the fly, despite all colocalizing at integrin adhesion sites throughout development, and being conserved in all metazoa ( Alatortsev et al., 1997; Grabbe et al., 2004; Kadrmas et al., 2004; Torgler et al., 2004; Maartens et al., 2016 ) ( diagrammed in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ). We recently reported a new phenotype in flies lacking vinculin ( Maartens et al., 2016 ), consisting of defective actin organisation in IFMs, suggesting that IFMs might reveal functions for other IAPs. Here we show that indeed IFMs reveals a new phenotype for each IAP examined, and genetic interactions reveal how they work together by balancing positive and negative control. Tensin is able to bind integrins ( Haynie, 2014 ), and contributes to focal adhesion maturation ( Rainero et al., 2015 ) and integrin inside-out activation ( Georgiadou et al., 2017 ). In IFMs we also find tensin elevates integrin activity, and discover this is negatively regulated by FAK, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase ( Kleinschmidt and Schlaepfer, 2017 ), thus providing a new mechanism for its inhibition of integrin adhesions ( Ili\u0107 et al., 1995 ). Like FAK, we discovered that RSU1 has a negative regulatory role in IFMs. RSU1 is a component of the IPP complex, containing integrin-linked-kinase, PINCH and parvin, via its binding to PINCH, and the function of this complex is not well understood ( Xu et al., 2016 ). Here we show that instead of promoting IPP function, as previously thought ( Kadrmas et al., 2004; Dougherty et al., 2005 ), RSU1 inhibits PINCH activity. By examining the localization of different IAPs and actin-binding proteins, we show that the MTZ is composed of 4 distinct layers. One of these layers, an actin rich region between the actin layer adjacent to the membrane and the start of the first sarcomere, requires vinculin, the mechanosensitive actin-binding protein filamin ( Razinia et al., 2012 ) and the nucleation promoting factor WASH ( Alekhina et al., 2017 ). Finally, we find that the mechanosensitive protein vinculin has dual functions at IFM adhesions. As mentioned, vinculin recruitment by stretched talin is a paradigm for mechanotransduction, yet we find that vinculin, once opened, can also function independently of talin, building an actin zone by promoting mechanical opening of filamin.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Our body consists of many different types of cells that build our tissues and organs. To do so, cells need to be able to stick together. One family of proteins called integrins helps to keep cells connected. They sit across cell membranes and anchor cells to the networks of protein fibres outside cells that link and strengthen our organs, and also connect muscles to tendons. In fruit flies, the indirect flight muscle attach to the thorax of the insect, and create wing movements by \u2018deforming\u2019 the thorax. These flight muscles resemble the muscles of animals with a backbone, and consist of many different fibres. At the end of these fibres is a plaque of a protein important for muscle contraction, known as actin. Integrins attach to these actin plaques, allowing the ends of the muscle to anchor to the tendon. Integrins form complexes with so-called 'integrin-associated proteins' inside the cell, which regulate integrin. Integrins and integrin-associated proteins are essential for proper muscle development, but until now it was not fully understood how they interact with each other. Here, Green et al. explored the role of some of these proteins in the indirect flight muscles of fruit flies. This revealed that the connection between muscle and tendon is a balancing act. Some integrin associated proteins boost the attachment, whilst others block it. One protein, tensin, increased integrin attachment, whilst another, FAK, blocked tensin, decreasing attachment. Similarly, a protein called PINCH expands the attachment, whilst a protein called RSU1 reduced the activity of PINCH to the correct level. Moreover, the end point of the muscle fibres was discovered to be composed of four distinct layers, including a newly identified layer of actin, which is built by three other integrin-associated proteins. The flight muscles of fruit flies are similar in structure to the skeletal muscles that move our own limbs. An important next step is to discover whether these integrin-associated proteins work similarly in our muscles. A better understanding of how they work together could help with research into diseases of the muscles ."}

Damaged Drosophila imaginal discs regenerate efficiently early in the third larval instar ( L3 ) but progressively lose this ability. This correlates with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes, including the WNT genes wingless ( wg ) and Wnt6. We demonstrate that damage-responsive expression of both genes requires a bipartite enhancer whose activity declines during L3. Within this enhancer, a damage-responsive module stays active throughout L3, while an adjacent silencing element nucleates increasing levels of epigenetic silencing restricted to this enhancer. Cas9-mediated deletion of the silencing element alleviates WNT repression, but is, in itself, insufficient to promote regeneration. However, directing Myc expression to the blastema overcomes repression of multiple genes, including wg, and restores cellular responses necessary for regeneration. Localized epigenetic silencing of damage-responsive enhancers can therefore restrict regenerative capacity in maturing organisms without compromising gene functions regulated by developmental signals.  The ability of tissues to regenerate following damage varies greatly between different species ( Li et al., 2015 ). Even some vertebrate species are capable of fully regenerating organs that have essentially no regenerative capacity in humans such as heart tissue in adult zebrafish ( Poss et al., 2002 ) and limbs in urodele amphibians such as newts and salamanders ( Tanaka and Reddien, 2011 ). Understanding the cellular differences between homologous organs that differ in their regenerative capacity among species could suggest genetic or pharmacological manipulations that improve the regenerative capacity of damaged organs in humans. The ability to regenerate specific organs differs not only between species, but can also change within a single species during its development. In general, for organisms that have determinate growth, i. e. growth that ceases once a genetically pre-determined size is reached ( Sebens, 1987 ), the capacity for regeneration usually decreases with increasing maturity. For example, embryonic and neonatal mice are able to regenerate myocardial tissue following substantial damage ( Drenckhahn et al., 2008; Porrello et al., 2011 ). However, within the first week of life, this capacity to regenerate is lost almost completely, and the damaged tissue\u00a0is\u00a0instead replaced by fibrotic scarring ( Porrello et al., 2011 ). Other examples include appendage regeneration in developing Xenopus ( Dent, 1962; Slack et al., 2004 ) and the progressive loss of digit regeneration in mice and humans ( King, 1979; Borgens, 1982; Reginelli et al., 1995 ). The basis for this phenomenon is not well understood. In some instances where tissue re-growth is dependent on stem cell based replacement of tissue ( for review see Tanaka and Reddien, 2011 ), the loss of a stem cell population could account for the inability to regenerate. However, this explanation cannot account for situations where regeneration is not driven by a stem cell population but rather by the proliferation and de-differentiation of adjacent tissue. In these cases the loss of regenerative capacity in a still-developing organism necessitates a mechanism that selectively inactivates regenerative processes while still allowing cell proliferation and differentiation associated with normal development. Since most genes that function during regeneration also have a variety of functions either in normal development or in maintaining homeostasis in the same tissue, it is presently unclear how their expression could be regulated so as to selectively block regeneration. Genetic studies using Drosophila have provided important insights into the genetic regulation of tissue growth. Many of these studies have examined growth of the imaginal discs, larval epithelial tissues that are precursors of adult structures, such as the wing and the eye ( Cohen, 1993 ). Imaginal discs are capable of regenerating missing portions following damage ( Worley et al., 2012 ). Studies of imaginal disc regeneration were pioneered by the group of Ernst Hadorn and were mostly conducted by transplanting damaged discs into the abdomens of adult female flies ( Ursprung and Hadorn, 1962 ). More recently, imaginal disc regeneration has been studied in intact larvae by damaging portions of the disc via brief expression of a pro-apoptotic gene in a spatially-restricted manner ( Smith-Bolton et al., 2009; Berganti\u00f1os et al., 2010 ). Using either a genetic ablation system ( Smith-Bolton et al., 2009 ), or following X-ray irradiation ( Halme et al., 2010 ), it was observed that the capacity of the wing-imaginal disc to regenerate progressively diminished during the later stages of the third larval instar as the larva approached the beginning of metamorphosis. Expression of wingless ( wg, Drosophila WNT1 ortholog ) is robustly upregulated in regenerating discs following genetic ablation. However, in more mature discs, which do not regenerate, there is a strong reduction in this wg upregulation ( Smith-Bolton et al., 2009 ). We chose to address the basis for reduced regeneration in mature discs by examining the mechanisms underlying the reduction in wg upregulation following damage. The upregulation of WNT proteins is an early and often essential response to tissue damage, observed in diverse species including Hydra and planaria ( Gurley et al., 2008; Petersen and Reddien, 2008; Lengfeld et al., 2009 ), as well as vertebrate species such as zebrafish, axolotls and Xenopus ( Kawakami et al., 2006; Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007; Yokoyama et al., 2007; Lin and Slack, 2008 ). Multiple studies have demonstrated that WNT signaling is essential for regeneration and is able to augment the process ( Kawakami et al., 2006; Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007; Yokoyama et al., 2007; Lin and Slack, 2008 ), even in tissues that do not normally undergo regeneration ( Kawakami et al., 2006 ). Thus, the mechanisms that link tissue damage in imaginal discs to wg upregulation, and the basis for diminished wg upregulation with increasing maturity, are likely to provide insights into similar processes in diverse organisms. Here we characterize the properties of an enhancer in the major WNT locus of Drosophila ( Schubiger et al., 2010 ) that mediates the upregulation of both wg and Wnt6 following damage to imaginal discs, and show that deletion of this enhancer impairs regeneration. We show that damage-responsive activation and age-dependent attenuation can each be\u00a0ascribed to separate modules within the enhancer, and while the damage-responsive module is equally effective in promoting damage-responsive gene expression in mature discs, its activity is overridden by an adjacent element that nucleates epigenetic silencing with increasing effectiveness as the larva matures. Importantly, this epigenetic silencing is restricted to the immediate vicinity of this enhancer, thereby not interfering with the activation of wg and Wnt6 by distinct developmentally regulated enhancers. We also describe a way of overcoming this silencing and improving regeneration in more mature larvae.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The ability of many animals to regenerate damaged tissues decreases as they age, for example, newborn mice can regenerate damaged heart tissue while older mice cannot. Researchers are trying to discover why older animals lose the ability to regenerate, which may help us to develop therapies that can regenerate damaged tissues in humans. Fruit flies are relatively simple animals that are often used as models in biology experiments. In young fruit fly larvae, there are tissues called imaginal discs that regenerate well after damage; however these discs lose this ability as the larva matures. A gene called wingless is very active in young larvae if the imaginal discs become damaged and helps them to regenerate. Previous studies show that this gene is not as strongly switched on in older larvae after tissue damage. However, since wingless also performs other roles in fruit flies, it is not clear how cells can stop wingless from being highly activated after tissue damage without affecting other important processes. Regions of DNA called enhancers can regulate the activity of genes. Harris et al. studied an enhancer that had previously been shown to drive the activation of wingless following tissue damage. The experiments show that there are two separate sections within the enhancer that control wingless activity. One section activates wingless in response to tissue damage and can perform this role even as the tissue matures. However, in older larvae, the other section alters the properties of the first section\u2019s DNA to reduce its effectiveness. By switching off this section of the enhancer \u2013 but not the wingless gene itself \u2013 the activity of wingless no longer responds to tissue damage, but can still be regulated by signals that influence other processes. Harris et al. also found that several other genes that are not active in mature tissues can be re-activated by a protein called Myc. Therefore, increasing the production of Myc in cells can promote the regeneration of more mature tissues. The next step is to find out if other genes involved in fly tissue regeneration are regulated in a similar way. A future challenge will be to find out if the same mechanism also limits tissue regeneration in humans and other more complex animals as they age ."}

We investigated three key areas of the macaque cortical grasping circuit with microelectrode arrays and found cooperative but anatomically separated visual and motor processes. The parietal area AIP operated primarily in a visual mode. Its neuronal population revealed a specialization for shape processing, even for abstract geometries, and processed object features ultimately important for grasping. Premotor area F5 acted as a hub that shared the visual coding of AIP only temporarily and switched to highly dominant motor signals towards movement planning and execution. We visualize these non-discrete premotor signals that drive the primary motor cortex M1 to reflect the movement of the grasping hand. Our results reveal visual and motor features encoded in the grasping circuit and their communication to achieve transformation for grasping.  Grasping objects of different shapes and sizes appears trivial in daily life. We can distinguish between thousands of objects ( Biederman, 1987 ) and shape our hands according to their geometry in order to hold and manipulate them ( Napier, 1956; Smeets and Brenner, 1999 ). Although such operations seem to be effortless, their underlying neuronal mechanisms are highly complex and require extensive computational resources ( Fagg and Arbib, 1998; Felleman and Van Essen, 1991 ). The cortical grasping network needs to translate high-dimensional visual information of an object into multidimensional motor signals that control the complex biomechanics of the hand. In the primate brain, these processes are linked to the anterior intraparietal ( AIP ), the ventral premotor ( F5 ), and the primary motor cortex ( M1 ) ( Brochier and Umilta, 2007; Castiello, 2005; Davare et al., 2011; Nelissen and Vanduffel, 2011 ). Within this network, AIP provides access to the dorsal visual stream that processes vision for action ( Culham et al., 2003; Goodale et al., 1994 ). In fact, neurons in AIP were shown to strongly respond to the presentation of graspable objects or 3D contours ( Murata et al., 2000; Taira et al., 1990; Theys et al., 2012b ), but could also encode specific grip types ( Baumann et al., 2009 ). This grasp-relevant information processed in AIP is exchanged with F5 via dense reciprocal connections ( Borra et al., 2008; Gerbella et al., 2011; Luppino et al., 1999 ). Accordingly, deactivation of AIP or F5 causes severe deficits in pre-shaping the hand while approaching an object ( Fogassi et al., 2001; Gallese et al., 1994 ). In contrast to AIP, concurrent electrophysiological studies suggest that F5 is primarily encoding objects in motor terms and is storing context-specific grip type information ( Fluet et al., 2010; Raos et al., 2006 ). Connections of the dorsal subdivision of F5 ( F5p ) to the spinal cord and to M1 provide further evidence for the important role of F5 for grasp movement preparation ( Borra et al., 2010; Dum and Strick, 2005 ). These electrophysiological and anatomical observations lead to our current understanding of the fronto-parietal network as the main circuitry for translating object attributes into motor commands ( Jeannerod et al., 1995; Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001 ). In detail, it has been suggested that visual features extracted in AIP activate motor prototypes in F5, which store hand configurations according to an object\u2019s geometry ( Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001 ). However, the detailed neural mechanisms of these processes remained unclear. To create a deeper understanding of how visual information is transformed into motor commands, a precise identification and differentiation of visual and motor processes within the grasping network is required. Previous important grasping studies classified visual-dominant, visual-motor or motor-dominant neurons primarily on the phase of their activation [for AIP see Murata et al. ( 2000 ) and Sakata et al. ( 1995 ), for F5 see Raos et al. ( 2006 ) ; Theys et al. ( 2012a ) ], but they could not discriminate between neural coding of visual features of objects or motor features of the hand. A differentiation between visual and motor coding is challenging for multiple reasons. First, the fronto-parietal network is multimodal and can reflect sensory and motor signals simultaneously. Second, visual and motor descriptions of objects and the hand are multidimensional due to the complexity of object geometry and hand physiology. Investigations at the neural level therefore necessitate multidimensional observations from many neurons. Third, the visual and motor spaces are highly linked to each other since the form of an object often defines the shape of the grasping hand. Disassociating both neuronal representations therefore requires highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses. In this study, we took a multidimensional approach to identify and separate visual and motor processes in the grasping network of AIP, F5, and M1. We recorded large populations of neurons simultaneously from the entire network and compared their modulation patters to the visual attributes of highly diverse objects and the kinematic features recorded from the grasping hand. Our data revealed distinct roles of the grasping network in translating visual object attributes ( AIP ) into planning ( F5 ) and execution signals ( M1 ) and allowed visualizing the propagation of these features for grasping.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: In order to grasp and manipulate objects, our brains have to transform information about an object ( such as its size, shape and position ) into commands about movement that are sent to our hands. Previous work suggests that in primates ( including humans and monkeys ), this transformation is coordinated in three key brain areas: the parietal cortex, the premotor cortex and the motor cortex. But exactly how these transformations are computed is still not clear. Schaffelhofer and Scherberger attempted to find out how this transformation happens by recording the electrical activity from different brain areas as monkeys reached out to grasp different objects. The specific brain areas studied were the anterior intraparietal ( AIP ) area of the parietal cortex, a part of the premotor cortex known as F5, and the region of the motor cortex that controls hand movements. The exact movement made by the monkeys\u2019 hands was also recorded. Analysing the recorded brain activity revealed that the three brain regions worked together to transform information about an object into commands for the hand, although each region also had its own specific, separate role in this process. Neurons in the AIP area of the parietal cortex mostly dealt with visual information about the object. These neurons specialized in processing information about the shape of an object, including information that was ultimately important for grasping it. In contrast, the premotor area F5 represented visual information about the object only briefly, quickly switching to representing information about the upcoming movement as it was planned and carried out. Finally, the neurons in the primary motor cortex were only active during the actual hand movement, and their activity strongly reflected the action of hand as it grasped the object. Overall, the results presented by Schaffelhofer and Scherberger suggest that grasping movements are generated from visual information about the object via AIP and F5 neurons communicating with each other. The strong links between the premotor and motor cortex also suggest that a common network related to movement executes and refines the prepared plan of movement. Further investigations are now needed to reveal how such networks process the information they receive ."}

The taste organs of phytophagous insects contain bitter gustatory receptors ( GRs ). To explore their function, the GRs in Plutella xylostella were analyzed. Through RNA sequencing and qPCR, we detected abundant PxylGr34 transcripts in the larval head and adult antennae. Functional analyses using the Xenopus oocyte expression system and 24 diverse phytochemicals showed that PxylGr34 is tuned to the canonical plant hormones brassinolide ( BL ) and 24-epibrassinolide ( EBL ). Electrophysiological analyses revealed that the medial sensilla styloconica of 4th instar larvae are responsive to BL and EBL. Dual-choice bioassays demonstrated that BL inhibits larval feeding and female oviposition. Knock-down of PxylGr34 by RNAi attenuates the taste responses to BL, and abolishes BL-induced feeding inhibition. These results increase our understanding of how herbivorous insects detect compounds that deter feeding and oviposition, and may be useful for designing plant hormone-based pest management strategies.  Many phytophagous insects have evolved to select a limited range of host plants. Understanding the ultimate and proximate mechanisms underlying this selection strategy is a crucial issue in the field of insect\u2013plant interactions. Insects\u2019 decisions to feed and oviposit are mainly based on information carried via chemosensory systems ( Schoonhoven et al., 2005 ). Insects discriminate among potential hosts after perceiving a combination of lineage-specific and more ubiquitous chemicals synthesized by plants. Some nutrients are ubiquitous across plant taxa. For example, various sugars and amino acids are feeding stimulants for the majority of herbivorous insects. Secondary plant metabolites occur in certain plant taxa at much higher concentrations than in others, and therefore are of greater significance in host-plant selection by insects ( Jermy, 1966 ). They are usually deterrent or \u2018bitter\u2019 compounds for many phytophagous insects, except for some specialized species that use them as token stimuli ( Schoonhoven et al., 2005 ). Phytophagous insects have sophisticated taste systems to recognize deterrent or stimulant compounds, which direct their feeding and oviposition behavior ( Yarmolinsky et al., 2009 ). The taste sensilla of insects are mainly situated on the mouthparts, tarsi, ovipositor, and antennae ( Bernays and Chapman, 1994 ). These sensilla take the form of hairs or cones with a terminal pore in the cuticular structure, and often contain the dendrites of three or four gustatory sensory neurons ( GSNs ). The axons of GSNs synapse directly onto the central nervous system. Analyses using the tip-recording technique for taste sensilla led to the discovery of a \u2018deterrent neuron\u2019 in the larvae of Bombyx mori ( Ishikawa, 1966 ) and Pieris brassicae ( Ma, 1969 ). Since then, GSNs coding for secondary plant metabolites have been identified in maxillary sensilla in larvae and tarsal sensilla of adults of many Lepidopteran species ( Glendinning et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2009 ). However, the molecular basis of these deterrent neurons remains unclear. Gustatory receptors ( GRs ) expressed in the dendrites of GSNs determine the selectivity of the response of GSNs ( Thorne et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004 ). Since the first insect GRs were identified in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster ( Clyne et al., 2000 ), the function of some of its bitter GRs have been revealed ( Dweck and Carlson, 2020; Freeman and Dahanukar, 2015 ). Five D. melanogaster GRs ( Gr47a, Gr32a, Gr33a, Gr66a, and Gr22e ) are involved in sensing strychnine ( Lee et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2015; Moon et al., 2009; Poudel et al., 2017 ). Nicotine-induced action potentials are dependent on Gr10a, Gr32a, and Gr33a ( Rimal and Lee, 2019 ). Gr8a, Gr66a, and Gr98b function together in the detection of L-canavanine ( Shim et al., 2015 ). Gr33a, Gr66a, and Gr93a participate in the responses to caffeine and umbelliferone ( Lee et al., 2009; Moon et al., 2006; Poudel et al., 2015 ). Gr28b is necessary for avoiding saponin ( Sang et al., 2019 ). However, only a few studies have focused on the function of bitter GRs in phytophagous insects. PxutGr1, a bitter GR in Papilio xuthus, was found to respond specifically to the oviposition stimulant, synephrine ( Ozaki et al., 2011 ). In recent studies, the insect bitter GRs BmorGr16, BmorGr18, and BmorGr53 showed response to coumarin and caffeine in vitro, and coumarin was found to have a feeding deterrent effect on B. mori larvae ( Kasubuchi et al., 2018 ) ; another bitter GR in B. mori, Gr66, was reported to be responsible for the mulberry-specific feeding preference of silkworms ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). Although some progress has been made in determining the functions of such receptors in Drosophila and a few herbivorous insects, we still lack basic mechanistic information about the functions of bitter GRs from most herbivorous insect lineages. Plutella xylostella ( L. ) is the most widespread Lepidopteran pest species, causing losses of US$ 4\u20135 billion per year ( You et al., 2020; Zalucki et al., 2012 ). It has developed resistance to the usual insecticides because of its short life cycle ( 14 days ) ( Furlong et al., 2013 ). P. xylostella mainly selects Brassica species as its host plants, and its females pat the leaf surfaces with their antennae before egg laying ( Qiu et al., 1998 ). This behavior may be related to certain chemical components in leaves of Brassica species, including sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, amines, glucosinolates, and plant hormones. Among these compounds, sinigrin and brassinolide ( BL ) have relatively higher concentrations in Brassica than in many other plant species ( Fahey et al., 2001; Lv et al., 2014 ). Sinigrin is known to be a feeding/oviposition stimulant for P. xylostella ( Gupta and Thorsteinson, 1960 ). The medial sensilla styloconica in the maxillary galea of P. xylostella larvae contain a GSN sensitive to sinigrin and other glucosinolates ( van Loon et al., 2002 ). BL\u00a0is a ubiquitous plant hormone that has been widely studied in relation to its role in plant growth and development ( Clouse and Sasse, 1998 ), but little is known about its effects on the behavior of phytophagous insects. To uncover the molecular basis of the perception of feeding/oviposition stimulants and deterrents by P. xylostella, we re-examined all the GRs reported in previous studies on this insect. Through transcriptome analysis and qPCR, we identified one bitter GR ( PxylGr34 ) highly expressed in the larval head and the adult antennae. We functionally analyzed this GR with the Xenopus oocyte expression system and RNAi, and found that PxylGr34 is tuned to BL as a feeding and oviposition deterrent in P. xylostella.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Plant-eating insects use their sense of taste to decide where to feed and where to lay their eggs. They do this using taste sensors called gustatory receptors which reside in the antennae and legs of adults, and in the mouthparts of larvae. Some of these sensors detect sugars which signal to the insect that the plant is a nutritious source of food. While others detect bitter compounds, such as poisons released by plants in self-defense. One of the most widespread plant-eating insects is the diamondback moth, which feeds and lays its eggs on cruciferous vegetable crops, like cabbage, oilseed rape and broccoli. Before laying its eggs, female diamondback moths pat the vegetable\u2019s leaves with their antennae, tasting for the presence of chemicals. But little was known about the identity of these chemicals. Cabbages produce large amounts of a hormone called brassinolide, which is known to play a role in plant growth. To find out whether diamondback moths can taste this hormone, Yang et al. examined all their known gustatory receptors. This revealed that the adult antennae and larval mouthparts of these moths make high levels of a receptor called PxylGr34. To investigate the role of PxylGr34, Yang et al. genetically modified frog eggs to produce this receptor. Various tests on these receptors, as well as receptors in the mouthparts of diamondback larvae, showed that PxylGr34 is able to sense the hormone brassinolide. To find out how this affects the behavior of the moths, Yang et al. investigated how adults and larvae responded to different levels of the hormone. This revealed that the presence of brassinolide significantly decreased both larval feeding and the amount of eggs laid by adult moths. Farmers already use brassinolide to enhance plant growth and protect crops from stress. These results suggest that the hormone might also help to shield plants from insect damage. However, more research is needed to understand how this hormone acts as a deterrent. Further studies could improve understanding of insect behavior and potentially identify more chemicals that can be used for pest control ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe anterior thalamic nucleus ( ATN ) is thought to play an important role in a brain network involving the hippocampus and neocortex, which enables human memories to be formed. However, its small size and location deep within the brain have impeded direct investigation in humans with non-invasive techniques. Here we provide direct evidence for a functional role for the ATN in memory formation from rare simultaneous human intrathalamic and scalp electroencephalogram ( EEG ) recordings from eight volunteering patients receiving intrathalamic electrodes implanted for the treatment of epilepsy, demonstrating real-time communication between neocortex and ATN during successful memory encoding. Neocortical-ATN theta oscillatory phase synchrony of local field potentials and neocortical-theta-to-ATN-gamma cross-frequency coupling during presentation of complex photographic scenes predicted later memory for the scenes, demonstrating a key role for the ATN in human memory encoding.  The anterior thalamic nuclei ( ATN ) are thought to play an important role in an extended hippocampal network central to memory formation ( encoding ) and novelty processing, which coordinates synaptic changes involving widespread neocortical areas, enabling life events to be recorded and later reinstated ( Knight, 1996; Aggleton et al., 2010; Nyhus and Curran, 2011; Ritchey et al., 2013; Schott et al., 2013 ). While corticothalamic interactions are well-known to be crucial for adaptive behavior ( Saalmann et al., 2012 ), the functional role of the ATN in humans has resisted investigation with non-invasive techniques owing both to its depth and small size. Here we had the rare opportunity to record electrophysiological activity during memory encoding directly from the ATN and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei ( DMTN ) of eight epileptic human volunteers with electrodes implanted for epilepsy treatment, as well as from frontal ( and in two cases, parietal ) scalp electrodes, reflecting neocortical activity ( Figure 1 ). The DMTN are thought to be involved in executive control during memory retrieval ( Van der Werf et al., 2003 ) and were hypothesized to play a lesser role than the ATN during encoding. 10. 7554/eLife. 05352. 003Figure 1.

Indication that the ATN has a role in memory processing comes from human lesion and animal studies. Damage to the human ATN results in amnesia for new episodes ( Harding et al., 2000; Van der Werf et al., 2003; Aggleton et al., 2010 ), and reciprocal frontal and parietal connections with the ATN ( Aggleton, 2012 ) have led to the hypothesis that ATN-hippocampal connections play a regulatory role in encoding ( Vertes et al., 2001; Aggleton et al., 2010 ). Notably, 75% of ATN oscillatory power in non-human animal studies is in the theta ( 4\u20138 Hz ) range, the dominant hippocampal rhythm ( Vertes et al., 2001 ), which is also implicated in ATN-hippocampal communication ( Vertes et al., 2001; Aggleton et al., 2010 ). Neural communication and synaptic plasticity rely on long-range phase\u2013phase and phase\u2013amplitude synchrony of neural oscillations ( Lachaux et al., 1999; Lisman and Jensen, 2013 ). Fronto-hippocampal theta synchrony accompanies memory formation ( Benchenane et al., 2010; Nyhus and Curran, 2011 ). Furthermore, theta synchrony is reported to bind medial temporal ( MT ) and parietal areas during associative encoding ( Crespo-Garcia et al., 2010 ), and MT with frontal and parietal cortex during successful retrieval ( Watrous et al., 2013 ). Neocortical and hippocampal gamma ( >30 Hz ) oscillations appear to reflect local processing related to activation and maintenance of neuronal object representations ( Jensen et al., 2007 ), binding diverse perceptual and contextual information ( Nyhus and Curran, 2011 ). Spatially separate gamma oscillations have been found to be locked to the phase of the theta oscillation, supporting binding of the coherent ensemble underlying a given memory trace ( Mizuhara and Yamaguchi, 2011 ). Indeed such gamma-power-to-theta-phase cross-frequency coupling ( CFC ) has been identified within human neocortex during word recognition ( Canolty et al., 2006 ), working memory maintenance ( Axmacher et al., 2010 ), and in successful long-term memory encoding ( Friese et al., 2012 ), as well as within the rat hippocampus ( Colgin et al., 2009 ), and has been proposed as a mechanism for transiently coupling distributed cortical activity ( Canolty et al., 2006; Friese et al., 2012; Lisman and Jensen, 2013 ). Together, these findings suggest that neocortical-ATN communication might be related to local ATN processing during encoding. We hypothesized that neocortical-ATN theta phase synchrony, and the relationship between theta phase and local ATN gamma amplitudes, would be critical for memory encoding.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Memories, both the mundane and the significant, play an integral role in our daily lives. Scientists have long sought to establish exactly how our memories are formed; how does an experience, with its sights, sounds and feelings, become a mental representation stored within our brain ? One way to investigate this question is to look at the activity of different parts of the brain. Brain imaging techniques have helped researchers identify two key brain regions that are involved in the process of memory formation: the neocortex and the hippocampus. The neocortex forms the outer layer of the brain, and performs complex tasks such as decision-making and language comprehension. The hippocampus, which sits deeper within the brain, deals primarily with memory and navigation. Research has shown that memory formation depends on communication between the neocortex and the hippocampus. However, scientists suspected that additional structures located beneath the neocortex\u2014among them, the anterior thalamic nuclei ( ATN ) \u2014are also crucial for forming memories. This has been difficult to confirm as the small size of the ATN, and their location deep within the brain, make their activity almost impossible to monitor using standard brain imaging techniques. One way reliable data can be recorded from the ATN is by inserting electrodes into the brain. Brain surgery of course cannot be carried out on healthy human participants, but occasionally an opportunity arises to study the brain activity of patients who have electrodes inserted for therapeutic purposes. For example, in cases where a patient's epilepsy does not respond to conventional treatments, electrodes may be implanted to electrically stimulate the ATN in an attempt to improve their symptoms. Sweeney-Reed et al. asked eight volunteers to perform a memory task, and monitored the activity of each volunteer's ATN via electrodes that had already been implanted in their brain to treat epilepsy. Simultaneously, electrodes attached to the scalps of the volunteers recorded the activity of the neocortex. When a memory was successfully stored in the brain, the activity of the two regions became synchronized. This suggests that successful memory formation depends upon communication between the ATN and the neocortex. While the involvement of the ATN in human memory formation has long been a topic of speculation, Sweeney-Reed et al. now provide direct biological evidence for its crucial role in the process. Consequently, future research into memory formation should focus upon the ATN in addition to the more familiar structures of the neocortex and the hippocampus ."}

Despite their critical location in our visual system and evidence that they are dynamically gated for dark/light adaptation, the full impact that rod\u2013cone GJs can have on cone function is not known. We recorded the photovoltage of mouse cones and found that the initial level of rod input increased spontaneously after obtaining intracellular access. This process allowed us to explore the underlying coupling capacity to rods, revealing that fully coupled cones acquire a striking rod-like phenotype. Calcium, a candidate mediator of the coupling process, does not appear to be involved on the cone side of the junctional channels. Our findings show that the anatomical substrate is adequate for rod\u2013cone coupling to play an important role in vision and, possibly, in biochemical signaling among photoreceptors.  In darkness, sparse single photon signals are relayed to retinal ganglion cells via a high gain/high convergence pathway formed by rods, rod bipolar cells, amacrine AII cells, and cone bipolar cells ( Nelson, 1982; Dunn et al., 2006 ). However, rod signals can bypass rod bipolar cells and enter directly into the cone pathway ( DeVries and Baylor, 1995 ). The earliest opportunity for this crossover is represented by rod\u2013cone gap junctions ( GJs ) ( Raviola and Gilula, 1973; Tsukamoto et al., 2001 ). GJs are assemblies of channels made by the docking of pairs of connexon hemichannels on adjacent cells, each formed by six connexin subunits. Cones contact nearby photoreceptors mainly at the tips of thin telodendria, which emerge from their synaptic pedicles, where they express connexin isoform 36 ( Cx36 ) ( Lee et al., 2003; O\u2019Brien et al., 2012 ), while the isoform expressed by rods has not been conclusively identified ( Lee et al., 2003; Feigenspan et al., 2004 ). The rod\u2013cone junctional plaques are very small, each containing few connexon channels ( Raviola and Gilula, 1973 ), and although rod signals were recorded in cat ( Nelson, 1977 ) and in macaque cones ( Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995, 1999; Hornstein et al., 2005 ), the extent to which rod\u2013cone coupling contributes to mammalian vision remains unclear. On the one hand, psychophysical and electroretinographic ( ERG ) experiments, in humans, detected putative correlates of rod\u2013cone coupling ( reviewed by Sharpe and Stockman, 1999 ), and ganglion cell and ERG recordings, in mice lacking Cx36, supported the view that rod\u2013cone coupling is relevant for dim light vision ( Deans et al., 2002; Volgyi et al., 2004; Abd-El-Barr et al., 2009; Seeliger et al., 2011 ) ; on the other hand, alternative mechanisms could explain the human data ( Sharpe and Stockman, 1999 ), and recordings in cone bipolar cells in Cx36 knockout mice suggested that rod\u2013cone coupling plays a marginal role in rod signal flow ( Pang et al., 2010, 2012 ). Highly relevant to this debate is the fact that rod\u2013cone GJs appear to be dynamically regulated: measurements of the extent of tracer diffusion in the outer rodent retina from the surface of a cut made with a razor blade ( a technique referred to as \u2018cut-loading\u2019 ) ( Ribelayga et al., 2008; Ribelayga and Mangel, 2010; Li et al., 2013 ), and ERG ( Heikkinen et al., 2011 ) suggest that endogenous neuromodulators, light, and circadian clocks influence the level of coupling ( but see Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1999 ) similarly to other retinal GJs ( Lasater and Dowling, 1985 ). However, cut-loading cannot discriminate between rod\u2013rod, rod\u2013cone and cone\u2013cone GJs, and it does not provide information on the absolute strength of coupling, but only on its relative changes. Therefore, the possibility that the impact of coupling on vision is strongly context-dependent raises three pressing questions: ( i ) what is the maximum level of rod\u2013cone coupling ? ( ii ) how strongly are cones influenced by rod input under these conditions ? ( iii ) what is the level of coupling under different physiological states ? Here we investigated the first two of these questions in mouse, a mainstay of current retina research and one in which direct proof of rod input in cones is still lacking. This important gap in our knowledge is explained by the fact that mouse cones were only recently shown to be accessible for patch clamp recordings ( Cangiano et al., 2012 ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: People can see in a range of light levels\u2014from dim moonlight to bright midday sun\u2014because our eyes contain two types of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones. Rods are more plentiful than cones, and while they are sensitive at low light levels, rods can only provide grey-scale vision. Further, bright light can rapidly \u2018dazzle\u2019 the ability of rods to see in near-darkness, and they are slow to recover when this happens. In contrast, cones need bright light to function, but allow us to see in colour. The signals received by rods and cones are sent through the optic nerve to the brain, where they are interpreted as vision. However, \u2018gap junctions\u2019 that connect the rods and cones allow for electrical and chemical \u2018crosstalk\u2019 between these cells, before the signals then travel along the optic nerve. Furthermore, even though it is thought that the connections between rods and cones are regulated in response to light, the body\u2019s daily rhythms and other biochemical signals, their importance for vision is not known. Now, Asteriti et al. have taken tissue slices from the retinas at the back of mice eyes, and measured the electrical signals generated when cones are exposed to light. This revealed that the rod-cone coupling is strong enough to make the cones responsive to dim light, just like rods. Moreover, the cones also recovered slowly after being exposed to flashes of bright light. When chemical inhibitors were used to block the gap junctions, the cones stopped behaving like rods and became less sensitive to dim light. The findings of Asteriti et al. show that rod-cone coupling is sufficient to play an important role in vision. The next challenge is to find out what this role is, and how it might be affected by different physiological conditions, including stress and injury ."}

C. elegans larvae respond to environmental stress by entering the stress-resistant dauer diapause pathway and resume development once conditions improve ( postdauers ). Here we show that the osm-9 TRPV channel gene is a target of developmental programming and is down-regulated specifically in the ADL chemosensory neurons of postdauer adults, resulting in a corresponding altered olfactory behavior that is mediated by ADL in an OSM-9-dependent manner. We identify a cis-acting motif bound by the DAF-3 SMAD and ZFP-1 ( AF10 ) proteins that is necessary for the differential regulation of osm-9, and demonstrate that both chromatin remodeling and endo-siRNA pathways are major contributors to the transcriptional silencing of the osm-9 locus. This work describes an elegant mechanism by which developmental experience influences adult phenotypes by establishing and maintaining transcriptional changes via RNAi and chromatin remodeling pathways.  Increasing evidence suggests that exposure to stressful environmental conditions during a critical period in the early development of an organism can result in altered gene expression patterns that are maintained into adulthood. In mammals, this 'cellular memory' of early life stress has been shown to correlate with behavioral phenotypes that persist into adulthood ( Weaver et al., 2004b; McGowan et al., 2009 ). For example, transcription levels of the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) gene in the mouse hippocampus are programmed by the maternal care behaviors of the mother towards her pups during the first postnatal week ( Fish et al., 2004; Weaver et al., 2004a; 2007; Szyf, 2007;\u00a02008 ). High maternal care behaviors ( such as frequent licking and grooming ) lead to high GR expression and low stress responses in the pups as adults, whereas low maternal care results in increased DNA methylation, transcriptional silencing of the GR gene, and high stress responses. Intriguingly, this mechanism of gene regulation appears to be conserved in humans, as childhood adversity correlates with increased transcriptional silencing of the GR gene and mental disorders in adults ( McGowan et al., 2008; 2009; Labont\u00e9 et al., 2012; Labonte et al., 2012 ). However, the molecular mechanisms establishing and maintaining the tissue-specific changes in gene expression in neurons due to environmental inputs during early development remain to be elucidated. We have shown that environmental stress early in development can also modulate gene expression and behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans, thereby establishing nematodes as a model system for investigating the mechanisms underlying developmental programming of gene expression ( Hall et al., 2010; 2013 ). The C. elegans life cycle is regulated by environmental cues during a critical period in the first larval stage. If conditions are favorable ( low temperature, high food availability, low pheromone concentrations ), worms continue to develop through four larval stages to become reproductive adults ( control adults, CON ). However, if conditions are unfavorable, worms enter the alternative stress-induced dauer diapause stage ( Golden and Riddle, 1982; 1984 ). The dauer formation ( daf ) decision is regulated by the differential expression of conserved insulin and TGF-\u03b2 pathways in sensory neurons in response to environmental conditions ( reviewed in Fielenbach and Antebi, 2008 ). Once conditions improve, dauer animals re-enter the reproductive cycle and continue development to become reproductive adults ( postdauer adults, PD ). We have shown previously that CON and PD adults retain a cellular memory of their developmental history through changes in gene expression, genome-wide chromatin state, and life history traits ( Hall et al., 2010 ). In addition, these altered adult phenotypes are in part dependent on endogenous small interfering RNA pathways ( endo-siRNAs ) ( Hall et al., 2013 ). In recent years, our knowledge of C. elegans endo-siRNA pathways and their gene targets has increased substantially. Endo-siRNAs are ~20 to 30 nt in length, antisense to coding transcripts, and are categorized into two major groups based on their biogenesis pathways ( Gent et al., 2010; Vasale et al., 2010 ). Primary endo-siRNAs are 26 nt long, have a characteristic 5\u2019 monophosphate, and are derived from Dicer processing of double-stranded\u00a0RNA template ( 26G-siRNAs ) ( Vasale et al., 2010 ). In somatic tissue, biogenesis of ERGO-1 class 26G-siRNAs is dependent upon the enhanced RNAi ( ERI ) complex, which consists of the core proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRP ) RRF-3, Dicer-related helicase DRH-3, and Tudor domain-containing protein ERI-5 that associate with Dicer DCR-1 ( Duchaine et al., 2006; Pavelec et al., 2009; Gent et al., 2010; Thivierge et al., 2012 ). Through an unknown mechanism, 26G-siRNAs stimulate the production of secondary endo-siRNAs, which are 22 nt in length, have a 5\u2019 triphosphate, and\u00a0are produced through reverse transcription of mRNA templates by RdRPs ( 22G-siRNAs ) ( Smardon et al., 2000; Simmer et al., 2002; Maine et al., 2005; Vought et al., 2005; Aoki et al., 2007; Pak et al., 2007; She et al., 2009; Vasale et al., 2010; Pak et al., 2012 ). Downstream effector functions of 22G-siRNAs, such as mRNA degradation or chromatin remodeling, are mediated by their associated worm-specific Argonaute protein ( WAGO ) in the cytoplasm or nucleus ( Yigit et al., 2006 ). Additionally, Mutator proteins have been shown to be essential for the biogenesis and siRNA amplification of AGO ERGO-1 class 26G- and WAGO class 22G-siRNAs ( Zhang et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2012; 2014 ). Although components of the Mutator complex are expressed throughout the worm, their functions and cellular localization are specific to the germline or soma ( Phillips et al., 2012; 2014 ). Despite our understanding of endo-siRNA biogenesis, how siRNAs target and regulate endogenous genes, particularly in response to environmental cues, is poorly understood. In this study, we show that expression of the OSM-9 TRPV channel is differentially regulated based on the developmental trajectory of C. elegans and describe the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of this gene as a function of the animal\u2019s developmental history. The osm-9 gene is down-regulated specifically in the ADL chemosensory neurons of PD adults, resulting in a corresponding altered olfactory behavior that is mediated by ADL in an OSM-9-dependent manner. We identify a cis-acting motif bound by the DAF-3 SMAD and ZFP-1 ( AF10 ) proteins that is necessary for the down-regulation of osm-9 in PD adults and demonstrate that both chromatin remodeling and endo-siRNA pathways are major contributors to osm-9 regulation. Our results suggest a mechanism of osm-9 regulation whereby the dauer developmental decision, triggered by environmental stress, results in transcriptional silencing of the osm-9 locus mediated by the TGF-\u03b2, chromatin remodeling, and endogenous RNAi pathways. This work describes an elegant mechanism of how tissue-specific changes in gene expression triggered by transient environmental cues can be maintained via developmental programming.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Increasing evidence suggests that experiencing stressful environments early on in life can have profound effects on the health and behavior of adults. For example, stressful conditions in the womb have been linked to adult depression and metabolic disorders. These effects are thought to be the result of changes in the way that genes in specific tissues are regulated in the individuals that have experienced the stress. However, it is not clear how a particular stress can cause long-term changes in gene activity in specific tissues. A microscopic worm called Caenorhabditis elegans is often used as a simple animal model to study how animals develop and behave. Previous studies have shown that adult worms that experienced stress early in life show differences in behavior and gene activity compared to genetically identical worms that did not experience the stress. Here, Sims, Ow et al. asked what signals are required for these changes to happen. The experiments show that a gene called osm-9 \u2013 which plays a role in the nervous system \u2013 is less active in sensory nerve cells in worms that experienced stress early on in life. This loss of activity resulted in the worms being unable to respond to a particular odor. Two proteins called DAF-3 and ZFP-1 are able to bind to a section of DNA in the osm-9 gene to decrease its activity in response to stress. These proteins are similar to human proteins that are important for development and are associated with some types of leukemia. Further experiments show that small molecules of ribonucleic acid in the \u201cRNA interference\u201d pathway also help to decrease the activity of osm-9 after stress. Together, Sims, Ow et al. \u2019s findings suggest that environmental conditions in early life regulate the osm-9 gene through the coordinated effort of DAF-3, ZFP-1 and the RNA interference pathway. The next steps are to investigate how these molecules are able to target osm-9 and to identify other proteins that regulate gene activity in response to stress in early life ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nProminent theories suggest that compulsive behaviors, characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction, are driven by shared deficits in goal-directed control, which confers vulnerability for developing rigid habits. However, recent studies have shown that deficient goal-directed control accompanies several disorders, including those without an obvious compulsive element. Reasoning that this lack of clinical specificity might reflect broader issues with psychiatric diagnostic categories, we investigated whether a dimensional approach would better delineate the clinical manifestations of goal-directed deficits. Using large-scale online assessment of psychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive performance in two independent general-population samples, we found that deficits in goal-directed control were most strongly associated with a symptom dimension comprising compulsive behavior and intrusive thought. This association was highly specific when compared to other non-compulsive aspects of psychopathology. These data showcase a powerful new methodology and highlight the potential of a dimensional, biologically-grounded approach to psychiatry research.  Compulsivity is a theoretical clinical phenomenon that reflects the loss of control over repetitive self-deleterious behavior seen in a range of disorders, most notably obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and addiction ( Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Gillan and Robbins, 2014 ). But what are the underlying neural, computational, or psychological mechanisms ? Researchers have suggested that compulsivity in these disorders may be partially explained by an imbalance between two different modes of control, which are more and less flexible ( Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Graybiel and Rauch, 2000 ). In particular, a deficit in deliberative, \u2018goal-directed\u2019 control may leave individuals vulnerable to rely excessively on forming more rigid habits. Habits are behaviors that animals and humans learn to execute automatically when presented with familiar environmental cues ( Dickinson, 1985 ). While habits are typically very useful, allowing us to efficiently perform routine actions while expending minimal cognitive effort, they cannot adapt flexibly to new situations. To override our habits, organisms are capable of \u2018goal-directed behavior\u2019. This refers our ability to make more considered choices, reflecting both ( i ) knowledge of the outcomes that our actions typically produce and ( ii ) our current motivation for those outcomes ( Dickinson and Balleine, 1994 ). Consistent with the hypothesis that compulsion is linked to an imbalance between these modes of control, deficits in goal-directed learning have been observed across a range of putatively compulsive disorders such as drug addiction ( Sjoerds et al., 2013; Voon et al., 2015 ), obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) ( Voon et al., 2015; Gillan et al., 2011; 2014a; 2014b; 2015a ) and also binge-eating disorder ( Voon et al., 2015 ). These deficits in goal-directed control have been linked to abnormal structure and function of the caudate and medial orbitofrontal cortex ( Voon et al., 2015; Gillan et al., 2015a ), suggesting that they may be a promising target for understanding the etiology of these disorders and thus for future treatment development. Critically, the scope of the relationship between goal-directed learning deficits and psychopathology, and particularly their specificity to compulsive versus non-compulsive aspects has not been established. In fact, a similar deficit in goal-directed control was recently reported in other patient groups ( Alvares et al., 2014; Morris et al., 2015 ), including those diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and schizophrenia, at least the former of which is not characterized by repetitive compulsive acts. This casts serious doubt over the hypothesis that goal-directed deficits are a neurocognitive mechanism that is partly responsible for psychiatric compulsivity. This lack of specificity is unfortunately ubiquitous in psychiatry research ( Lipszyc and Schachar, 2010; Bickel et al., 2012 ), a result, we suggest, of the broader issue that psychiatric diagnostic categories do not reflect the most discrete and neurobiologically informative phenomena. Of particular relevance to the present study are the high rates of co-morbidity between OCD and social anxiety disorder ( Ruscio et al., 2010 ), the preponderance of OCD symptoms in the schizophrenia poopulation ( Poyurovsky and Koran, 2005 ), and more broadly that the vast majority of patients diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) meet the criteria for another lifetime psychiatric disorder ( Ruscio et al., 2010 ). Given these major overlaps, dissociating the neurocognitive bases for these respective diagnostic categories in their current form may be untenable. Indeed, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ), now in it\u2019s fifth edition ( American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ) was developed to provide a reliable, descriptive psychiatric taxonomy, rather than an etiologically valid one. As such it is difficult to clearly discriminate the diagnostic categories it defines on the basis of genetics, neuroimaging, or indeed any of the modern tools of cognitive neuroscience. These issues have been described in detail by others ( Cuthbert and Kozak, 2013; Hyman, 2007; Robbins et al., 2012 ), and have been recognized by the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ), which has launched the Research Domain Criteria ( RDoC ) initiative, aiming to identify biologically plausible, trans-diagnostic markers of psychiatric disturbances ( Insel et al., 2010 ). Although progress towards this goal has already been made by studies examining dissociable clusters of patients within groups diagnosed with the same disorder ( Brodersen et al., 2014; Fair et al., 2012 ), the identification of robust, generalizable and specific markers that contribute to psychiatric co-morbidity has been curtailed by the small sample sizes that are typical of patient studies. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a dimensional approach leveraging the efficiencies of large-scale online data collection among healthy individuals could be used to determine the precise psychiatric phenotype associated with deficits in goal-directed control, and test the specificity of this relationship with respect to other aspects of psychopathology. We hypothesized that this phenotype would broadly relate to compulsive behavior, which is seen across multiple disorders, including OCD and addiction ( Gillan et al., 2015b ), but were interested to reveal the scope and generality of this, e. g. with respect to impulsivity, a putatively related clinical phenotype ( Robbins et al., 2012 ). We also wished to study how any psychiatric correlates of goal-directed control relate to variation in age and IQ, two more general factors that have been shown to covary both with goal-directed control and with some aspects of psychopathology ( Eppinger et al., 2013; Schad et al., 2014; Sandstrom et al., 1998 ). To this end, rather than diagnosed patients, we used two large general-population samples collected online via Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk ( AMT ) to test ( i ) if compulsivity as indicated by self-report OCD symptoms is associated with individual differences in goal-directed learning, ( ii ) if this association generalizes to self-report symptoms of other DSM diagnostic categories that involve compulsivity, and ( iii ) if this association is specific to compulsive versus non-compulsive psychopathology. Goal-directed control has recently been computationally formalized as arising from a form of reinforcement learning known as \u2018model-based\u2019 ( Daw et al., 2011 ), which can be expressed as an individual difference measure that has been shown to predict how likely individuals are to form habits ( Gillan et al., 2015c ). Using this well-validated task ( Figure 1 ) ( Daw et al., 2011 ), we found support for all three postulates. In Experiment 1, we found that total scores on a self-report questionnaire measuring the severity of OCD symptoms were tracked by normal variation in model-based learning in the general population, but not by self-report anxiety or depression symptoms. In Experiment 2, we replicated the association with self-report OCD symptoms and showed that it generalized to a broader set of psychiatric symptoms that similarly involve failures in exerting control over self-deleterious behaviors, specifically alcohol addiction, eating disorders and impulsivity. Once again, we found tentative evidence for specificity with respect to non-compulsive aspects of psychopathology. Next, we conducted a factor analysis, which indicated the existence of three latent symptom dimensions that cut across the nine different questionnaires assessed in this study. Crucially, the second symptom dimension identified was characterized by \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019, in which items were most consistently drawn from the questionnaires assessing symptoms of OCD, eating disorders and addiction, pertaining not just to repetitive compulsive behaviors ( as was our prediction ), but also to associated preoccupations and cognitive distortions. This factor, which was defined independently of task performance, was a significant predictor of deficits in model-based learning. Crucially, this effect was highly specific to this factor, when directly compared to the two other factors identified in this analysis, \u2018Anxious-Depression\u2019 and \u2018Social Withdrawal\u2019. 10. 7554/eLife. 11305. 003Figure 1. Two-step reinforcement learning task used to assess goal-directed ( model-based ) learning. ( a ) Subjects chose between two fractals, which probabilistically determined whether they would transition to the orange or blue second stage state. For example, the fractal on the left had a 70% chance of leading to the blue second stage state ( \u2018common\u2019 transition ) and a 30% chance of leading to the orange state ( \u2018rare\u2019 transition ). These transition probabilities were fixed and could be learned over time. In the second stage state, subjects chose between two fractals, each of which was associated with a distinct probability of being rewarded with a 25 cents coin. The probability of receiving a reward associated with each second stage fractal could also be learned, but ( unlike the transition structure ) these drifted slowly over time ( 0. 25 < P <0. 75, panel b ). This meant that in order to earn the most rewards possible, subjects had to track which second stage fractals were currently best as they changed over time. Reward probabilities depicted ( 34%, 68%, 72%, 67% ) refer to example trial 50, denoted by the vertical dashed line in ( b ).

This kind of control allows individuals to regulate their behaviour in a deliberate manner. It is thought that a reduction in goal-directed control may be linked to compulsiveness or compulsivity, a psychological trait that involves excessive repetition of thoughts or actions. Furthermore, evidence shows that goal-directed control is reduced in people with compulsive disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder ( or OCD ) and drug addiction. However, failures of goal-directed control have also been reported in other mental health conditions that are not linked to compulsivity, such as social anxiety disorder. The fact that reduced goal-directed control is found across various mental health conditions highlights a core issue in modern psychiatric research and treatment. Mental health conditions are typically defined and diagnosed by their clinical symptoms, not by their underlying psychological traits or biological abnormalities. This makes it difficult to determine the cause of a specific disorder, as its symptoms are often rooted in the same psychological and biological traits seen in other mental health conditions. To start to tackle this issue, Gillan et al. used a strategy that allowed them to look at compulsivity as a \u201ctrans-diagnostic dimension\u201d; that is, as something that exists on a spectrum and is not specific to one disorder but involved in numerous different mental health conditions. Nearly 2, 000 people completed an online task that assessed goal-directed control, and filled in questionnaires that measured symptoms of various mental health conditions. Gillan et al. showed that, as expected, people with reduced goal-directed control were generally more compulsive, and that this relationship could be seen in the context of both OCD and other compulsive disorders such as addiction. Further, by leveraging the efficiency of online data collection to collect such a large sample, Gillan et al. were also able to examine how much different symptoms co-occurred in people. This enabled them to use a statistical technique to pick out three trans-diagnostic dimensions \u2013 compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought, anxious-depression and social withdrawal \u2013 and found that only the compulsive factor was associated with reduced goal-directed control. In fact, reduced goal-directed control was found to be more closely related to compulsivity than the symptoms of traditional mental health disorders including OCD. These findings show that research into the causes of mental health conditions and perhaps ultimately diagnosis and treatment \u2013 all of which have traditionally approached specific disorders in isolation \u2013 would benefit greatly from a trans-diagnostic approach ."}

We have developed and applied Dynamic Organellar Maps, a proteomic method that allows global mapping of protein translocation events. We initially used maps statically to generate a database with localization and absolute copy number information for over 8700 proteins from HeLa cells, approaching comprehensive coverage. All major organelles were resolved, with exceptional prediction accuracy ( estimated at >92% ). Combining spatial and abundance information yielded an unprecedented quantitative view of HeLa cell anatomy and organellar composition, at the protein level. We subsequently demonstrated the dynamic capabilities of the approach by capturing translocation events following EGF stimulation, which we integrated into a quantitative model. Dynamic Organellar Maps enable the proteome-wide analysis of physiological protein movements, without requiring any reagents specific to the investigated process, and will thus be widely applicable in cell biology.  The hallmark of eukaryotic cells is their compartmentalization into distinct membrane-bound organelles. Protein function is critically determined by subcellular localization, as organelles offer different chemical environments and interaction partners. In order to regulate protein activity, many biological processes involve changes in protein subcellular localization. Prominent examples include the endocytic uptake of activated plasma membrane signalling receptors, to terminate the signalling process ( Jones and Rappoport, 2014 ), and the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of many transcription factors, to regulate their access to DNA ( Plotnikov et al., 2011 ). The ability to monitor changes in organellar composition would provide a powerful tool to investigate cell biological processes at the systems level. While transcriptomic ( Curtis et al., 2012 ) and proteomic abundance profiling approaches ( Deeb et al., 2015 ) have yielded valuable insights into changes in gene or protein expression, they lack the important spatial dimension. Microscopy-based approaches can provide spatial information on individual proteins ( Uhlen et al., 2015 ), but are limited by the availability of specific antibodies, and are very labour-intensive for analysing complete proteomes ( Marx, 2015 ). Genome-wide GFP-tagging in yeast circumvents the need for antibodies ( Huh et al., 2003 ), but tags may inadvertently alter protein subcellular localisation, which is difficult to control for; in addition, serial imaging of cells for comparative purposes remains experimentally challenging ( Breker et al., 2013 ). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has much enhanced our understanding of cellular composition ( Larance and Lamond, 2015 ). Although sophisticated approaches for organellar proteomics have been available for over a decade ( Andersen et al., 2003; Christoforou et al., 2016; Dunkley et al., 2004; Foster et al., 2006; Gilchrist et al., 2006; Smirle et al., 2013 ), there is currently no proteomic method that allows global dynamic mapping of protein subcellular localization. The main reason for this deficiency is the high variability between spatial proteomics experiments, which renders the identification of genuine organellar transitions very difficult ( Gatto et al., 2014 ). Here, we have developed a rapid proteomic profiling workflow for the generation of highly reproducible organellar maps. We use the method to assemble a comprehensive database of protein subcellular localization and abundance information from HeLa cells, allowing us to build a quantitative model of cellular anatomy. We then apply organellar maps to capture the protein translocation events triggered by EGF stimulation, demonstrating the dynamic capabilities of our approach.

[/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The interior of every cell is highly organised, and contains many compartments, called organelles, that are dedicated to specific roles. Proteins are the tools and machines of the cell, and each organelle has its own set of proteins that it requires to work correctly. Each cell contains ten or more organelles, and several thousand different types of proteins. The exact location of proteins in the cell is important; once we know what compartment a protein is in, it is easier to narrow down what it might be doing. The location of many proteins in a cell is unclear or simply not known. Moreover, since changing the location of a protein can change its activity, it is also important to be able to detect changes in the location of proteins under different circumstances, such as before and after drug treatment. Itzhak et al. set out to develop a method that reveals the locations of all the proteins in a cell at any given time. The resulting technique maps the location of most of the proteins in a human cancer cell line and, in addition, determines how many copies of each protein there are. Combining these two types of information produces a model of the cell\u2019s architecture. Importantly, Itzhak et al. were able to compare such a model of the cell under normal circumstances to a model made after the cell had been stimulated with a growth factor. This revealed which proteins had changed location, identifying these proteins as important for the cell\u2019s response to the growth factor. The new mapping method could be used in the future to analyse the anatomy of different cell types, such as nerve cells and cells of the immune system. Itzhak et al. also want to investigate the differences between healthy cells and cells from people with neurological disorders to understand how such diseases arise ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nAgeing is associated with physical decline and the development of age-related diseases such as metabolic disorders and cancer. Few conditions are known that attenuate the adverse effects of ageing, including calorie restriction ( CR ) and reduced signalling through the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) pathway. Synthesis of the metabolic transcription factor C/EBP\u03b2-LIP is stimulated by mTORC1, which critically depends on a short upstream open reading frame ( uORF ) in the Cebpb-mRNA. Here, we describe that reduced C/EBP\u03b2-LIP expression due to genetic ablation of the uORF delays the development of age-associated phenotypes in mice. Moreover, female C/EBP\u03b2\u0394uORF mice display an extended lifespan. Since LIP levels increase upon aging in wild type mice, our data reveal an important role for C/EBP\u03b2 in the aging process and suggest that restriction of LIP expression sustains health and fitness. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting C/EBP\u03b2-LIP may offer new possibilities to treat age-related diseases and to prolong healthspan.  Delaying the occurrence of age related-diseases and frailty ( disabilities ) and thus prolonging healthspan, would substantially increase the quality of life of the ageing population and could help to reduce healthcare costs. Calorie restriction ( CR ) or pharmacological inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway by rapamycin are considered as potential effective interventions to delay aging and to increase healthspan in different species ( Kaeberlein et al., 2015 ). However, for humans CR is a difficult practice to maintain and may have pleiotropic effects depending on genetic constitution, environmental factors and stage of life. Likewise, the long-term use of rapamycin is limited by the risk of side effects, including disturbed glucose homeostasis, impaired wound healing, gastrointestinal discomfort and others ( Augustine et al., 2007; de Oliveira et al., 2011; Lamming et al., 2012; Wilkinson et al., 2012 ). Therefore, there is a need to investigate alternative targets that are part of the CR/mTORC1 pathway that can be manipulated to reach similar beneficial effects. Our work suggests that the transcription factor C/EBP\u03b2 may provide such a target. C/EBP\u03b2 regulates the expression of metabolic genes in liver and adipose tissue ( Desvergne et al., 2006; Roesler, 2001 ). From its mRNA, three protein isoforms are synthesized through the usage of different translation initiation sites: two isoforms acting as transcriptional activators, liver-enriched activator protein ( LAP ) \u22121 and \u22122, and a transcriptional inhibitory isoform called liver-enriched inhibitory protein ( LIP ) ( Descombes and Schibler, 1991 ). We showed earlier that translation into LIP depends on a cis-regulatory uORF ( Figure 1A ) and is stimulated by mTORC1 signalling ( Calkhoven et al., 2000; Jundt et al., 2005; Zidek et al., 2015 ). Pharmacological or CR-induced inhibition of mTORC1 in mice selectively reduces LIP-protein synthesis and thereby increases the LAP/LIP ratio in different tissues ( Zidek et al., 2015 ). Experimental reduction of LIP expression by genetic ablation of the uORF in C/EBP\u03b2\u0394uORF knockin mice is associated with a CR-type improved metabolic profile, including enhanced fatty acid oxidation and reduction of steatosis, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and higher adiponectin levels. Notably, these metabolic improvements are achieved without reducing calorie intake ( Albert and Hall, 2015; Zidek et al., 2015 ). Because of the similarities between t\ufeffh\ufeffe\u00a0C/EBP\u03b2\u0394uORF mutation and CR, we investigated lifespan and age-associated phenotypes in C/EBP\u03b2\u0394uORF mice. Here, we show that the C/EBP\u03b2\u0394uORF mutation is associated with an increase in lifespan and reduced tumour incidence in female mice. In addition, we show an improvement in a broad spectrum of age-associated phenotypes to varying degrees in males and females.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The risks of major diseases including type II diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s are linked to the biological process of ageing. By finding ways to slow ageing, we can help more people to live longer healthier lives while avoiding these illnesses. Placing some animals on a diet that contains only two-thirds as many calories as they would normally eat can improve their fitness during old age and delay the onset of many age-related problems. It is unrealistic to expect people to control their diet to this extent, yet there may be other ways to bring about the same effects. Calorie restriction affects the activity of many different genes; for example, it causes a gene that produces a protein known as Liver-enriched Inhibitory Protein ( LIP for short ) to shut down. LIP controls the activity of many genes involved in metabolism, so it could be a key target for drugs to control ageing. M\u00fcller, Zidek et al. used mice that are unable to produce LIP to study this protein\u2019s effect on ageing. The life expectancy of female mice lacking LIP increased by up to 20%. These mice were leaner, fitter, more resistant to cancer, had stronger immune systems and controlled their blood sugar levels better than normal mice. Male mice that lacked LIP did not live longer but did experience some ageing-related benefits. Genetic analysis also showed that gene activity particularly of metabolic genes is more robust in old female LIP-deficient mice and thus more similar to young control mice than old control mice. The results presented by M\u00fcller, Zidek et al. suggest that targeting the activity of the LIP gene could help to slow the ageing process. It is not yet clear whether shutting off LIP has similar beneficial effects in humans. Further research is also needed to investigate why female mice gain more benefits from a lack of LIP than males do ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe rostrocaudal ( head-to-tail ) axis is supplied by populations of progenitors at the caudal end of the embryo. Despite recent advances characterising one of these populations, the neuromesodermal progenitors, their nature and relationship to other populations remains unclear. Here we show that neuromesodermal progenitors are a single Sox2lowTlow entity whose choice of neural or mesodermal fate is dictated by their position in the progenitor region. The choice of mesoderm fate is Wnt/\u03b2-catenin dependent. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling is also required for a previously unrecognised phase of progenitor expansion during mid-trunk formation. Lateral/ventral mesoderm progenitors represent a distinct committed state that is unable to differentiate to neural fates, even upon overexpression of the neural transcription factor Sox2. They do not require Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling for mesoderm differentiation. This information aids the correct interpretation of in vivo genetic studies and the development of in vitro protocols for generating physiologically-relevant cell populations of clinical interest.  The vertebrate rostrocaudal axis elongates in a rostral-to-caudal sequence by virtue of a population of progenitors at the caudal end of the embryo, in and near the primitive streak ( PS ) and later in the tail bud ( TB; reviewed in Wilson et al. ( 2009 ) ). Clonal analysis has demonstrated the presence of axial progenitors that behave as dual-fated tissue stem cells of the neurectoderm and somitic mesoderm ( Tzouanacou et al., 2009 ), termed neuromesodermal progenitors ( NMPs ). Population fate maps at early somite stages have identified two regions of dual neurectoderm and mesoderm fate: the dorsal layer of the bilayered Node-Streak Border ( NSB ) and the Caudal Lateral Epiblast ( CLE ) on either side of the PS. The NSB also gives rise to the majority of the neuromesoderm-fated chordoneural hinge ( CNH ) in the tail bud ( Cambray and Wilson, 2002; 2007 ). The adjacent midline PS and rostral node ( RN ) are fated exclusively for mesoderm and notochord, respectively ( Figure 1A\u2013D ). The caudal-most tip of the CLE, and the adjoining caudal primitive streak, are solely fated for lateral/ventral mesoderm ( LVM ) ( Cambray and Wilson, 2007 ). Thus cell fate in and around the PS is highly regionalised. 10. 7554/eLife. 10042. 003Figure 1. Location of neuromesodermal and lateral/ventral mesoderm progenitors.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10042. 003 Fate mapping studies in early somite-stage mouse and chick embryos indicate a rostrocaudal organisation of mesoderm progenitors within the PS. Midline mesoderm is produced by the rostral PS, while successively more caudal regions of the streak are fated for the paraxial and lateral mesoderm ( Cambray and Wilson, 2007; Brown and Storey, 2000; Catala et al., 1996; Schoenwolf, 1992; Wilson and Beddington, 1996 ). We have previously shown that cells fated exclusively for the medial somite in the NSB can be re-fated to more lateral regions of the somite on transplantation to the anterior primitive streak ( Cambray and Wilson, 2007 ), indicating a degree of plasticity in paraxial\u00a0mesoderm ( PXM ) fates. However, the extent of mesoderm plasticity in the PS and CLE has not been fully investigated. In particular, it is not known whether axial, paraxial and lateral mesoderm progenitors in the PS region are committed to these fates. Fate maps of the CLE in chick indicate that cells at the rostral or lateral edges of the CLE form more neurectoderm than those at caudal or medial positions, which tend to generate mesoderm ( Brown and Storey, 2000; Iimura et al., 2007 ). Furthermore, fate maps of mouse and chick have suggested that CLE progenitors are more transitory than those in the NSB, since they do not contribute to long axial stretches or extensively to the CNH ( Cambray and Wilson, 2007; Brown and Storey, 2000; Iimura et al., 2007 ). However, the potency of these populations has not been tested, leaving open the question of whether these regional differences are simply the product of differing cellular environments acting on a single cell type to determine fate, or whether multiple populations with restricted potency exist within the PS region. T, Tbx6, Fgfr1 and Wnt3a are expressed in the PS region and required for correct mesoderm production, and loss of each of them leads both to shortened axes, and the ectopic production of neural tissue at the expense of somitic mesoderm ( Chapman and Papaioannou, 1998; Yamaguchi et al., 1999; Yoshikawa et al., 1997; Ciruna et al., 1997 ). This suggests that NMP maintenance is intimately linked with preserving a balance between neurectoderm and mesoderm production. Tbx6 expression in the midline PS represses Sox2 in mesoderm-fated cells, ensuring suppression of the neural transcription program ( Takemoto et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, in zebrafish, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation influences the decision of cells in both gastrula- and somite-stage embryos to enter neural or mesodermal lineages ( Martin and Kimelman, 2012 ). More recently, lineage-tracing experiments showed that conditional deletion of Wnt3a or \u03b2-catenin in the T+ cell compartment leads to a switch of primitive streak progenitors towards a neural fate ( Garriock et al., 2015 ). However, constitutive Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity in the T+ cell compartment is not sufficient to divert all neural progenitors to mesoderm fates: providing cells in the caudal progenitor region with a stabilised form of \u03b2-catenin results in an enlarged PSM domain, but does not lead to loss of neural cell production ( Aulehla et al., 2008; Jurberg et al., 2014 ). Moreover, enhanced \u03b2-catenin activity does not necessarily compromise the presence of NMPs in the CLE ( Garriock et al., 2015 ). While these experiments point to an important role of Wnt signalling in axial progenitors, the promoters used do not specifically target NMPs. Grafting of precise NMP areas can provide a complementary approach that allows a direct assessment of the currently unresolved roles of Wnt signalling in NMPs and the caudal-most CLE. In this study, we investigate the heterogeneity, plasticity and commitment of NMPs and lateral/ventral mesoderm progenitors, and the mechanisms by which they choose between alternative fates. We find that NMPs are committed to neuromesodermal lineages and choose between retention as progenitors, and differentiation as either neurectoderm or mesoderm based on their location within the progenitor region; the latter choice is \u03b2-catenin dependent. We show that NMPs express low levels of T and Sox2, and that during mid-trunk formation, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling expands the number of Sox2+T+ NMPs and maintains the appropriate level of T in the NMP population. We further show that lateral/ventral mesoderm progenitors are exclusively mesoderm-committed yet show plasticity within the mesoderm lineage, and respond to distinct signalling and transcription factor cues from those that govern NMPs.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Our bodies, like those of all animals with a backbone, form during embryo development in a head-to-tail sequence. This process is fuelled by populations of proliferating cells called progenitor cells, which are found in an early embryonic structure called the primitive streak, and later at the tail-end of the embryo. One of these populations \u2013 known as the neuromesodermal progenitors ( or NMPs ) \u2013 produces the animal\u2019s spinal cord, muscle and bone tissue. However, it is not clear how this cell population is maintained or what triggers these cells to specialise into the correct cell type. It is even unclear whether NMPs are a single cell type or a collection of several types of progenitor, each with a slightly different propensity to make spinal cord or muscle and bone. Answering these questions could inform the future development of cell-replacement therapies for conditions such as spinal injuries. Wymeersch et al. used a range of techniques to identify, map the fate, and assess the developmental potential of progenitors in the primitive streak. This revealed fine-grained differences in the fates adopted by cells in the progenitor region. However, these regional differences were found to result from the progenitor cells\u2019 extensive ability to respond to signals they receive from their environment, rather than being hard-wired into the progenitor cells. In fact, Wymeersch et al. detected only two distinct cell types: the NMPs and a new cell population termed lateral/paraxial mesoderm progenitors ( or LPMPs ), which, unlike NMPs, do not form nerve cells. Further experiments investigated the molecular signals present in the environment of these progenitors that help to decide their fate. NMPs respond to an important developmental signal, called Wnt, by adopting a so-called mesoderm fate. This signal also induces NMPs to undergo a previously unknown phase of proliferation during the formation of the animal\u2019s body. LPMPs, on the other hand, do not require Wnt to form mesoderm. These findings show that studies with embryos can identify new progenitor populations that might be clinically relevant, and reveal new ways in which a cell\u2019s environment inside an embryo can determine its fate ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nDiscrete populations of brain cells signal heading direction, rather like a compass. These \u2018head direction\u2019 cells are largely confined to a closely-connected network of sites. We describe, for the first time, a population of head direction cells in nucleus reuniens of the thalamus in the freely-moving rat. This novel subcortical head direction signal potentially modulates the hippocampal CA fields directly and, thus, informs spatial processing and memory.  Nucleus reuniens ( NRe ), one of the largest midline thalamic nuclei, receives extensive limbic inputs and provides a bridge linking the hippocampus ( especially area CA1 ) with medial prefrontal cortex ( McKenna and Vertes, 2004; Vertes, 2006; Prasad and Chudasama, 2013 ). Its functions are not well-understood, but it has been suggested that, via these connections, NRe influences memory consolidation for spatial learning and generalisation of fear conditioning ( Eleore et al., 2011; Loureiro et al., 2012; Xu and Sudhof, 2013 ). To elucidate its functions open-field single-unit recordings in NRe of freely-moving rats were made ( Mink et al., 1983 ). We have found an unexpected population of NRe cells signalling head direction ( HD ) in the horizontal plane, independent of location within the test arena. These cells resemble HD cells in the anterodorsal and anteroventral thalamic nuclei ( Shinder and Taube, 2011; Tsanov et al., 2011 ), the lateral mammillary nucleus ( Taube, 2007 ), and certain parahippocampal regions ( Cassel et al., 2013 ). NRe cells maintain head directionality during light\u2013dark transitions, and in environments of different shape. These cells establish directionality rapidly upon first entering an environment. NRe has not, to date, been part of the traditional HD circuit, which largely originates in the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden and the lateral mammillary nucleus ( Taube, 2007; Cassel et al., 2013 ). Subsequent processing is via the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, dorsal presubiculum, entorhinal cortex and to the hippocampus ( Su and Bentivoglio, 1990; Vertes et al., 2007 ). Our findings, therefore, reveal a novel head direction signal potentially modulating the hippocampal CA fields and, therefore, hippocampal spatial processing ( Brandon et al., 2013 ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Whether it is foraging for food or finding its way back to its nest, an animal often needs to know which direction it is heading in. Some neurons in a mammal\u2019s brain have been shown to act like a compass, and send out nerve impulses whenever the animal points its head in a certain direction. For example, some of these neurons will fire when the animal faces northeast, but not when it faces northwest, and vice versa. Importantly these neurons, called \u2018head direction\u2019 cells, do not actually measure the Earth's magnetic field. Rather, they respond to information about landmarks in the environment and the animal's movements of its head or body to work out which way the animal is facing. Head direction cells are largely found in a closely-connected network of a few sites in the brain. However, Jankowski et al. have now discovered more of these cells in another region found deep within the centre of the brain. Measuring the nerve impulses from these neurons in rats that were moving freely around a test arena revealed that the neurons fired in exactly the same way as some other head direction cells in other regions of the brain. For example, they fired whenever the rat faced one direction, but stopped firing when it turned its head to face another. Jankowski et al. showed that the head direction cells in this region of the brain continued to work when the lights were turned off in the test arena, or when the shape of the arena was changed from a circle to a square. These neurons began sending information about head direction as soon as the rat entered the test arena, and many continued to fire when the rat faced the same direction even when they were retested on several different days. The head direction cells discovered by Jankowski et al. are connected to another region of the brain that is involved in remembering different locations in the environment and navigating between them. This suggests that these neurons might provide some of the information required to carry out these tasks. It also means that areas of the brain close to those that receive input from the outside world may perform more complex cognitive functions than previously thought ."}

Evolution has repeatedly recruited the Cys-protease asparaginyl endopeptidase ( AEP ) to perform their head-to-tail ligation. These macrocyclization reactions use the substrates amino terminus instead of water to deacylate, so a peptide bond is formed. How solvent-exposed plant AEPs macrocyclize is poorly understood. Here we present the crystal structure of an active plant AEP from the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus. The active site contained electron density for a tetrahedral intermediate with partial occupancy that predicted a binding mode for peptide macrocyclization. By substituting catalytic residues we could alter the ratio of cyclic to acyclic products. Moreover, we showed AEPs from other species lacking cyclic peptides can perform macrocyclization under favorable pH conditions. This structural characterization of AEP presents a logical framework for engineering superior enzymes that generate macrocyclic peptide drug leads.  Asparaginyl endopeptidases ( AEPs ) are a group of asparagine/aspartic acid ( Asx ) specific proteases that have been classified as belonging to the C13 family of cysteine proteases based on the presence of a His-Gly-spacer-Ala-Cys motif ( Hara-Nishimura et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1997; Mathieu et al., 2002; Shafee et al., 2015 ). First described in plants as vacuolar processing enzymes based on their propensity for processing seed proteins stored in vacuoles, AEPs have since been described in a variety of organisms and shown to be involved in a wide range of processes including, cell death antigen processing and hemoglobin degradation ( Hara-Nishimura et al., 1993; Manoury et al., 1998; Hatsugai et al., 2004; Kuroyanagi et al., 2005; Yamada et al., 2005; Sojka et al., 2007 ). In addition to the proteolytic function observed in these processes, AEP has become well known for its curious ligation reactions ( Min and Jones, 1994; Sheldon et al., 1996; Mylne et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014; Dall et al., 2015 ). The ability of endoproteases to perform ligation reactions was first observed by Bergmann and Fruton in 1938 with chymotrypsin ( Bergmann and Fruton, 1938 ). Later, in vitro ligation reactions were performed with AEP from jack bean ( Canavalia ensiformis ) seeds ( Bowles et al., 1986; Min and Jones, 1994 ). The recent discovery that evolutionarily distinct plant families have repeatedly recruited AEPs to catalyze the formation of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides ( RiPPs ), through the macrocyclization of linear precursor sequences, has caught the attention of drug designers keen to overcome the current inefficiencies in native chemical ligation that limit the therapeutic use of cyclic peptides ( Pattabiraman and Bode, 2011; Mylne et al., 2012; Arnison et al., 2013 ). Such therapeutic cyclic peptides are viewed by many to have the potential to capitalize on a niche in the current pharmaceutical market by virtue of their intermediate size between small molecule drugs and large protein structures, and their unique capacity to combine favorable bioavailability and stability characteristics with high target specificity facilitated by tolerance to site-directed mutagenesis ( Clark et al., 2005, 2010; Gould et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2013; Poth et al., 2013; Truman, 2016 ). Moreover, as computational techniques for the discovery of RiPPs improve and the number of cyclic peptides described continues to expand, an ever-wider array of scaffolds might be exploited to tailor molecules to specific drug targets ( Bhardwaj et al., 2016; Truman, 2016; Hetrick and van der Donk, 2017 ) ( Figure 1 ). Sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1 ( SFTI-1 ) is a 14-residue, bicyclic peptide with a cyclic backbone and an internal disulfide bond ( Luckett et al., 1999 ). Its biosynthesis is rather unusual as its sequence is buried within a precursor that also encodes seed storage albumin. Seed storage albumins are a major class of seed storage protein that constitute over 50% of total seed protein and become a source of nitrogen and sulfur during seed germination ( Youle and Huang, 1978; Shewry and Halford, 2002 ). The common sunflower ( Helianthus annuus ) has many genes encoding precursors for these napin-type or 2S seed storage albumins that are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum before undergoing cleavage maturation by AEP and localizing to storage vacuoles ( Bollini and Chrispeels, 1979; Franke et al., 2016; Jayasena et al., 2016 ). Along with an adjacent albumin, SFTI-1 is post-translationally processed by AEP from within a unique seed storage albumin precursor called Preproalbumin with SFTI-1 ( PawS1 ) ( Mylne et al., 2011 ). SFTI-1 is a potent inhibitor of serine proteases, and its intrinsic stability and cellular penetration capabilities have led to its application as a bioactive scaffold ( White and Craik, 2016; Swedberg et al., 2017 ). AEP-catalyzed macrocyclization of SFTI-1 is hypothesized to proceed via a cleavage-coupled intramolecular transpeptidation reaction whereby catalysis begins with the deprotonation of the active site Cys by a localized His of the catalytic center, facilitating the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the Asp by the activated Cys thiol of AEP ( Bernath-Levin et al., 2015 ). This attack culminates in the formation of a thioacyl intermediate between the substrate and AEP, and the removal of the C-terminus. The reaction is proposed to be subsequently concluded by the nucleophilic attack of this intermediate by a Gly at the N-terminus of the substrate, resulting in the macrocyclization of SFTI-1 in a head-to-tail manner ( Mylne et al., 2011; Bernath-Levin et al., 2015 ). Notably, this reaction proceeds in competition with nucleophilic attack upon the thioacyl intermediate by any nearby water molecules which would produce hydrolyzed, acyclic-SFTI. In vitro studies revealed the ratio of acyclic to cyclic SFTI-1 to be in the order of 5. 8:1, with the less stable acyclic products hypothesized to be quickly degraded in vivo ( Bernath-Levin et al., 2015 ). Evidence for AEP-mediated and hydrolysis-independent transpeptidation was demonstrated through the exclusion of a heavy atom O18 in the cyclic SFTI-1 product from an in vitro jack bean AEP ( CeAEP1 ) catalyzed reaction ( Bernath-Levin et al., 2015 ). The formation of a much larger cyclic peptide by an AEP from Oldenlandia affinis ( OaAEP1 ) was also shown to lack O18 incorporation, suggesting a conserved mechanism of macrocyclization despite differences in substrate sequences ( Harris et al., 2015 ). However, the suggestion that an AEP from butterfly pea ( Clitoria ternatea ) termed butelase one functions only as a ligase ( Nguyen et al., 2014 ), combined with the proposal of a succinimide-driven, cleavage-independent ligation event based on the crystal structure of human AEP ( hAEP ) and its ability to ligate substrate in the absence of the catalytic Cys, has cast uncertainty on the mechanism of AEP-catalyzed macrocyclization ( Dall et al., 2015 ). In order to elucidate a structural explanation why plant AEPs have been recruited by distinct plant lineages to perform macrocyclization and to understand the catalytic and structural nuances that might allow preferences towards cleavage or ligation reactions, we sought the crystal structure of a sunflower AEP. Herein, we describe the first structure of an active plant AEP; one capable of performing peptide macrocyclization. This AEP, the most abundant AEP of five AEPs in the common sunflower ( HaAEP1 ), displays structural similarity to previously published active AEPs from mammals, with subtle differences at residues involved in substrate recognition. Our characterization by site-directed mutagenesis of HaAEP1 residues integral to macrocyclization will facilitate the bioengineering of plant AEPs for improved macrocyclization efficiency, diversifying the scaffolds usable as cyclic therapeutic leads.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Most proteins are long, chain-like molecules that have two ends respectively called the N-terminus and C-terminus. However, certain proteins can close on themselves to become circular. This requires a chemical reaction between the N- and C-termini, which creates a strong bond between the two extremities. To go through this \u2018cyclization\u2019 process, a straight protein attaches to a certain type of protease, a class of enzyme that usually cuts proteins into smaller pieces. In plants that are distantly related, the same group of enzymes \u2013 called AEPs \u2013 has been selected to perform cyclization. Here, Haywood et al. study an AEP enzyme from sunflowers: they identify what about this enzyme\u2019s structure is important to drive the complex chemical reaction that results in the protein being cyclized rather than simply cut. Using a technique called X-ray crystallography to see the positions of individual atoms in the enzyme, Haywood et al. caught a snapshot of the enzyme. Its structure explained how the enzyme\u2019s shape can guide cyclization. In particular, the part of the enzyme that binds to the proteins, the active site, was relatively flat and open, but also flexible: this helped the N and C-termini react with each other and close the protein. Further experiments artificially mutated specific areas of the enzyme, which helped determine exactly which elements guide this succession of chemical reactions. The activity of AEPs is influenced by their local environment, such as acidity. In fact, Haywood et al. showed that certain AEPs, which do not normally carry out cyclization, can start performing this role when exposed to a different level of acidity. The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly interested in circular proteins, as these are stable, easily used by the body, and can be genetically customized to act only on specific targets. If the cyclization process is better understood, and then harnessed, new drug compounds could be produced ."}

Tissue-specific regulators of AS are essential components of the gene regulatory network, required for normal cellular function, tissue patterning, and embryonic development. However, their cell-autonomous function in neural crest development has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that splicing factor Rbfox2 is expressed in the neural crest cells ( NCCs ), and deletion of Rbfox2 in NCCs leads to cleft palate and defects in craniofacial bone development. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that Rbfox2 regulates splicing and expression of numerous genes essential for neural crest/craniofacial development. We demonstrate that Rbfox2-TGF-\u03b2-Tak1 signaling axis is deregulated by Rbfox2 deletion. Furthermore, restoration of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by Tak1 overexpression can rescue the proliferation defect seen in Rbfox2 mutants. We also identified a positive feedback loop in which TGF-\u03b2 signaling promotes expression of Rbfox2 in NCCs.  Approximately 3\u20134% of infants are born with congenital diseases. Collectively, craniofacial and cardiovascular abnormalities are the most common defects, contributing to more than one-third of the congenital diseases. Proper formation of these structures involves intricate processes such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation of NCCs, as well as their interaction with neighboring cells ( Martik and Bronner, 2017; Plein et al., 2015 ). NCCs are a transient population of migratory progenitor cells that reside in the dorsal side of the neural tube. The NCCs separate from their neighboring cells through a delamination process and migrate via different pathways throughout the body to diverse locations, differentiating into multiple cell types at their respective destinations ( Martik and Bronner, 2017 ). NCCs can be subdivided into five axial populations: cranial, cardiac, vagal, trunk and sacral NC cells. Lineage-tracing experiments in mouse embryos have demonstrated that NCCs differentiate into a diverse array of cell types including the craniofacial skeletal elements, autonomous nervous system of the heart and GI-tract, as well as smooth muscle cells of the cardiac OFT ( Chai et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2004; Martik and Bronner, 2017; Plein et al., 2015; Waldo et al., 1999; Yoshida et al., 2008 ). Cranial NCCs migrate from anterior portions of the folded neural tube and contribute to the formation of the skull, cartilage, and connective tissue, where they populate the first and second pharyngeal arches that give rise to cranial ganglia, the maxilla, the mandible, palates and other structures of the developing head ( Chai et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2002; Martik and Bronner, 2017 ). In mammals, both the primary and secondary palates are morphologically visible as early as E11. 5 as demonstrated by an outgrowth from the oral side of the medial nasal and maxillary processes, respectively. The primary palate is formed by fusion of the maxillary prominence with the frontonasal prominence ( Bush and Jiang, 2012; Dixon et al., 2011 ). Secondary palates are formed from the outgrowths of neural crest-derived mesenchyme that lie on either side of the developing tongue ( Bush and Jiang, 2012 ). Initially, palatal shelves grow vertically flanking the developing tongue, but they elevate between E13. 5 and E14. 5 to a horizontal position above the tongue, grow toward the midline and fuse with each other to form an intact palate ( Bush and Jiang, 2012 ). Functional defects in NCCs result in craniofacial malformations including cleft lip and/or cleft palate. Many transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors, non-coding RNA and signaling molecules have been implicated in impaired neural crest development that result in cardio-craniofacial syndromes ( B\u00e9langer et al., 2018; Martik and Bronner, 2017; Plein et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2013; Strobl-Mazzulla et al., 2012 ). However, the cell-autonomous role of splicing regulators in neural crest biology remains unclear and warrants further investigation. AS of pre-messenger RNAs is essential for regulating gene expression and creating proteomic diversity. Changes in exon inclusion or exclusion can produce multiple mRNAs and protein isoforms with related or distinct functions. The RNA-binding fox-1 ( Rbfox ) homolog proteins: Rbfox1, Rbfox2, and Rbfox3 are evolutionarily conserved splicing factors that have been implicated in diverse cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell death and epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( Kuroyanagi, 2009 ). A conserved RNA-Recognition Motif that recognizes UGCAUG element in the introns, flanking target exons, characterizes Rbfox proteins ( Jin et al., 2003 ). Rbfox proteins regulate splicing either positively or negatively, depending on their binding sites. They promote exon skipping or inclusion when they bind to either the upstream or downstream of the alternative exon ( Jin et al., 2003; Ponthier et al., 2006 ). In addition to splicing, Rbfox proteins also regulate transcriptional gene networks ( Fogel et al., 2012 ). Although all Rbfox proteins bind to the same recognition sequence, their in vivo functions are only partially redundant due to their markedly distinct expression pattern. Both Rbfox1 ( A2BP1 ) and Rbfox2 ( RBM9 ) are expressed in the neurons, heart and skeletal muscle ( Gehman et al., 2012; Gehman et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2015 ). Unlike the aforementioned, Rbfox3 ( NeuN or HRNBP3 ) expression is more restricted to neuronal tissues ( Kim et al., 2014 ). Several diseases have been associated with dysregulation of splicing ( Garcia-Blanco et al., 2004 ). For example, genetic deletion of Rbfox1 and Rbfox2 in the nervous system increased susceptibility to seizures and impaired cerebellum development, respectively ( Gehman et al., 2012; Gehman et al., 2011 ). Morpholino-mediated knockdown of Rbfox1 and Rbfox2 in zebrafish embryos impaired cardiac and skeletal muscle functions ( Gallagher et al., 2011 ). During skeletal muscle development, Rbfox2-mediated splicing is required for myoblast fusion and differentiation ( Runfola et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2014 ). Decreased Rbfox2 expression has been reported in response to transverse aortic constriction in the mouse heart, and cardiac-specific deletion leads to pressure overload-induced heart failure ( Wei et al., 2015 ). Abnormal expression of Rbfox2 has also been associated with hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( Verma et al., 2016 ). Recently, Nutter et al. ( 2016 ) demonstrated that elevated Rbfox2 protein expression in diabetic hearts affects diabetes-induced AS of cardiac-specific genes. Despite extensive studies of Rbfox2 regulation on neuronal, cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, the cell-autonomous role of Rbfox2 in the functioning of neural crest cells has not been explored. In the present study, we demonstrate that Rbfox2 is expressed in the neural crest cells ( NCCs ), neural crest-derived palate shelves, dorsal root ganglia, and somites. To determine the role of Rbfox2 during embryonic development, we deleted Rbfox2 using floxed Rbfox2 ( Rbfox2flox/flox ) and Pax3Cre/+ knock in mice ( Engleka et al., 2005; Gehman et al., 2012 ). We observed that Pax3Cre/+-mediated deletion of Rbfox2 results in neonatal lethality. Rbfox2 mutant ( Rbfox2Pax3-CKO ) embryos develop a cleft palate and defects in the development of craniofacial skeleton, suggesting defective cranial neural crest development. To determine whether cleft palate and craniofacial defects were due to deletion of Rbfox2 in the neural crest cells, we generated a neural crest-specific Rbfox2 mutant ( Rbfox2Wnt1-CKO ) using Wnt1Cre/+ allele ( Gehman et al., 2012; Lewis et al., 2013 ). Similar to Rbfox2Pax3-CKO embryos, Rbfox2Wnt1-CKO mutants developed a cleft palate and craniofacial skeleton defects and died postnatally at day 1. RNA-Seq analysis revealed an essential role of Rbfox2 in regulating splicing and expression of genes required for the development of cranial neural crest-derived structures. We demonstrate that Rbfox2-TGF-\u03b2-Tak1 signaling axis is impaired in the neural crest-derived cells of the Rbfox2 mutant embryos and restoration of Tak1 expression in cultured palatal mesenchymal cells can rescue the proliferation defect observed in Rbfox2 mutants. We also identified a positive feedback loop by which TGF-\u03b2 signaling components, Smad2/3/4, bind directly to the Rbfox2 promoter and regulate its expression in the neural crest cells. Together, these results reveal a highly regulated Rbfox2-dependent splicing and transcriptional program that modulates cranial neural crest development.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Abnormalities affecting the head and face \u2013 such as a cleft lip or palate \u2013 are among the most common of all birth defects. These tissues normally develop from cells in the embryo known as the neural crest cells, and specifically a subset of these cells called the cranial neural crest cells. Most cases of cleft lip or palate are linked back to genes that affect the biology of this group of cells. The list of genes implicated in the impaired development of cranial neural crest cells code for proteins with a wide range of different activities. Some encode transcription factors \u2013 proteins that switch genes on or off. Others code for chromatin remodeling factors, which control how the DNA is packed inside cells. However, the role of another group of proteins \u2013 the splicing factors \u2013 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. When a gene is switched on its genetic code is first copied into a short-lived molecule called a transcript. These transcripts are then edited to form templates to build proteins. Splicing is one way that a transcript can be edited, which involves different pieces of the transcript being cut out and the remaining pieces being pasted together to form alternative versions of the final template. Splicing factors control this process. Cibi et al. now show that neural crest cells from mice make a splicing factor called Rbfox2 and that deleting this gene for this protein from only these cells leads to mice with a cleft palate and defects in the bones of their head and face. Further analysis helped to identify the transcripts that are spliced by Rbfox2, and the effects that these splicing events have on gene activity in mouse tissues that develop from cranial neural crest cells. Cibi et al. went on to find a signaling pathway that was impaired in the mutant cells that lacked Rbfox2. Forcing the mutant cells to over-produce one of the proteins involved in this signaling pathway ( a protein named Tak1 ) was enough to compensate for the some of the defects caused by a lack of Rbfox2, suggesting it acts downstream of the splicing regulator. Lastly, Cibi et al. showed that another protein in this signaling pathway, called TGF-\u03b2, acted to increase how much Rbfox2 was made by neural crest cells. Together these findings may be relevant in human disease studies, given that altered TGF-\u03b2 signaling is a common feature in many birth defects seen in humans ."}

Here, we propose that human observers are capable of generating their own feedback signals by monitoring internal decision variables. We investigated this hypothesis in a visual perceptual learning task using fMRI and confidence reports as a measure for this monitoring process. Employing a novel computational model in which learning is guided by confidence-based reinforcement signals, we found that mesolimbic brain areas encoded both anticipation and prediction error of confidence\u2014in remarkable similarity to previous findings for external reward-based feedback. We demonstrate that the model accounts for choice and confidence reports and show that the mesolimbic confidence prediction error modulation derived through the model predicts individual learning success. These results provide a mechanistic neurobiological explanation for learning without external feedback by augmenting reinforcement models with confidence-based feedback.  Learning is an integral part of our everyday life and necessary for survival in a dynamic environment. The behavioral changes arising from learning have quite successfully been described by the reinforcement learning principle ( Sutton and Barto, 1998 ), according to which biological agents continuously adapt their behavior based on the consequences of their actions. Thus, reinforcement learning models and most other learning models depend on feedback from the environment. Yet, there are important instances of learning where no such external feedback is provided, challenging the generality of these learning models in shaping our behavior. A well-studied case of learning is the improvement of performance in perceptually demanding tasks through training or repeated exposure ( Gibson, 1963 ). Such perceptual learning has repeatedly been demonstrated to occur without feedback ( Herzog and Fahle, 1997; Gibson and Gibson, 1955; McKee and Westheimer, 1978; Karni and Sagi, 1991 ) and is therefore ideally suited as a test case to study learning in the absence of external feedback. Previous work has emphasized the role of reinforcement learning in perceptual learning ( Kahnt et al., 2011; Law and Gold, 2009 ). However, these accounts were based on perceptual learning with external feedback and therefore cannot account for instances in which learning occurs without external feedback. Here, we pursued the idea that, in the absence of external feedback, learning is guided by internal feedback processes that evaluate current perceptual information in relation to prior knowledge about the sensory world. We reasoned that introspective reports of perceptual confidence could serve as a window into such internal feedback processes. In this scenario, low or high confidence would correspond to a negative or positive self-evaluation of one\u2019s own perceptual performance, respectively. Accordingly, confidence could act as a teaching signal in the same way as external feedback in normative theories of reinforcement learning ( Daniel and Pollmann, 2012; Hebart et al., 2014 ). Applied to the case of perceptual learning, a confidence-based reinforcement signal could serve to strengthen neural circuitry that gave rise to high-confidence percepts and weaken circuitry that led to low-confidence percepts, thereby enhancing the quality of future percepts. We tested this idea in a challenging perceptual learning task, in which participants continuously reported their confidence in perceptual choices while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ). No external feedback was provided; instead, confidence ratings were used as a proxy of internal monitoring processes. To account for perceptual learning in the absence of feedback, we devised a confidence-based associative reinforcement learning model. In the model, confidence prediction errors ( Daniel and Pollmann, 2012 ) serve as teaching signals that indicate the mismatch between the current level of confidence and a running average of previous confidence experiences ( expected confidence ). Based on recent evidence of confidence signals in the mesolimbic dopamine system ( Daniel and Pollmann, 2012; Hebart et al., 2014; Schwarze et al., 2013 ), we hypothesized to find neural correlates of confidence prediction errors in mesolimbic brain areas such as the ventral striatum and the ventral tegmental area. Since confidence prediction errors act as a teaching signal in our model, we hypothesized that the strength of these mesolimbic confidence signals should be linked to individual perceptual learning success.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Much of our behavior is shaped by feedback from the environment. We repeat behaviors that previously led to rewards and avoid those with negative outcomes. At the same time, we can learn in many situations without such feedback. Our ability to perceive sensory stimuli, for example, improves with training even in the absence of external feedback. Guggenmos et al. hypothesized that this form of perceptual learning may be guided by self-generated feedback that is based on the confidence in our performance. The general idea is that the brain reinforces behaviors associated with states of high confidence, and weakens behaviors that lead to low confidence. To test this idea, Guggenmos et al. used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging to record the brain activity of healthy volunteers as they performed a visual learning task. In this task, the participants had to judge the orientation of barely visible line gratings and then state how confident they were in their decisions. Feedback signals derived from the participants\u2019 confidence reports activated the same brain areas typically engaged for external feedback or reward. Moreover, just as these regions were previously found to signal the difference between actual and expected rewards, so did they signal the difference between actual confidence levels and those expected on the basis of previous confidence levels. This parallel suggests that confidence may take over the role of external feedback in cases where no such feedback is available. Finally, the extent to which an individual exhibited these signals predicted overall learning success. Future studies could investigate whether these confidence signals are automatically generated, or whether they only emerge when participants are required to report their confidence levels. Another open question is whether such self-generated feedback applies in non-perceptual forms of learning, where learning without feedback has likewise been a long-standing puzzle ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nRift Valley fever phlebovirus ( RVFV ) is a clinically and economically important pathogen increasingly likely to cause widespread epidemics. RVFV virulence depends on the interferon antagonist non-structural protein ( NSs ), which remains poorly characterized. We identified a stable core domain of RVFV NSs ( residues 83\u2013248 ), and solved its crystal structure, a novel all-helical fold organized into highly ordered fibrils. A hallmark of RVFV pathology is NSs filament formation in infected cell nuclei. Recombinant virus encoding the NSs core domain induced intranuclear filaments, suggesting it contains all essential determinants for nuclear translocation and filament formation. Mutations of key crystal fibril interface residues in viruses encoding full-length NSs completely abrogated intranuclear filament formation in infected cells. We propose the fibrillar arrangement of the NSs core domain in crystals reveals the molecular basis of assembly of this key virulence factor in cell nuclei. Our findings have important implications for fundamental understanding of RVFV virulence.  Rift Valley fever phlebovirus ( RVFV ), of the genus Phlebovirus, is one of the most clinically significant members of the Phenuiviridae family, of the Bunyavirales order ( Elliott and Brennan, 2014; Plyusnin et al., 2012; Adams et al., 2017 ). RVFV is an arbovirus spread by many mosquito vector species as well as by exposure to infected tissues. It causes recurring epidemics in livestock and humans ( Ikegami and Makino, 2011 ). The most prominent effect of RVFV infection in ruminants is a high rate of abortions. In humans infections are usually self-limiting, but can develop into hepatitis, retinitis, encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever with fatality rates of 0. 5\u20132% ( Pepin et al., 2010 ). Although originally endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, RVFV has recently appeared in Madagascar, the Comoros and the Arabian Peninsula ( Balkhy and Memish, 2003 ). Increasing spread of competent mosquito vector species due to climate change could facilitate emergence of this virus in new ecosystems, including Europe and the United States ( Chevalier, 2013; Elliott, 2009; Golnar et al., 2014; Rolin et al., 2013 ). In 2017 the World Health Organization ranked RVFV among the ten most dangerous pathogens most likely to cause wide epidemics in the near future, requiring urgent attention ( http://www. who. int/blueprint/priority-diseases/en/ ). While an animal vaccine for RVFV exists, there is no treatment available for human use ( Boshra et al., 2011; Lihoradova and Ikegami, 2014 ). RVFV is a zoonotic arbovirus evolved to evade the immune response of mammals and insects. Innate immune antagonism of RVFV is primarily mediated by its main virulence factor, the 30 kDa non-structural protein ( NSs ), which is transcribed and translated from a subgenomic mRNA derived from the antigenomic S segment early during infection. NSs impedes interferon production through three known mechanisms ( Billecocq et al., 2004; Bouloy et al., 2001 ). In infected host cells, NSs is transported into the nucleus where it interferes with the assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex transcription factor II H ( TFIIH ) by binding to the p44 subunit ( Le May et al., 2004 ) and directing the p62 subunit for degradation ( Kainulainen et al., 2014; Kalveram et al., 2011 ), thereby halting global cellular transcription. NSs also prevents activation of the interferon-\u03b2 promoter specifically by binding to factor SAP30, a member of a multisubunit histone deacetylase transcriptional repression complex that regulates interferon-\u03b2 expression ( Le May et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, NSs blocks host recognition of viral dsRNA by targeting the RNA-dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) for degradation ( Ikegami et al., 2009a, 2009b ). RVFV with a deletion of NSs cannot establish viremia and is not pathogenic in the mouse model ( Bouloy et al., 2001 ). A characteristic feature of RVFV pathogenesis is formation of 0. 5 \u03bcm thick proteinaceous filaments formed by bundles of thin fibrils in the nuclei of infected cells ( Swanepoel and Blackburn, 1977 ). The filaments are composed primarily of NSs protein ( Struthers and Swanepoel, 1982; Yadani et al., 1999 ) but co-localize with p44, XPB, SAP30 and YY1, as well ( Le May et al., 2004, 2008 ). It is not clear if filament formation is required for NSs function, that\u00a0is if any interaction sites are present on the monomeric form of the protein, or are only present in the multimerized, fibrillar NSs. In the absence of structural information it is difficult to dissect NSs function from filament formation. Potential functions of nuclear NSs filaments include sequestering NSs binding partners, causing cell cycle arrest and defects in chromosome cohesion and segregation ( Mansuroglu et al., 2010 ). This could contribute to the high rate of fetal deformities and abortions observed in RVFV-infected ruminants ( Baer et al., 2012; Mansuroglu et al., 2010 ). NSs proteins are encoded in the S segment of the tripartite negative sense single strand RNA genome of most members of the Phlebovirus genus, and other families of the Bunyavirales order such as the Peribunyaviridae, Nairoviridae, and some members of the Hantaviridae ( Ly and Ikegami, 2016 ). They constitute notoriously difficult targets for structural characterization due to an inherent tendency to multimerize, as well as the putative presence of substantial intrinsically unfolded regions. While high-resolution structures of glycoproteins ( Dessau and Modis, 2013 ) and nucleoproteins ( Ferron et al., 2011; Raymond et al., 2010 ) from RVFV and several other bunyaviruses have been determined, no structural information is currently available for any NSs protein, significantly limiting the current understanding of key bunyaviral virulence mechanisms. Structure and function can also not be predicted based on sequence, as NSs proteins are \u2018ORFans\u2019, with very little sequence similarity in members of the Bunyavirales order and the Phlebovirus genus. Despite large sequence diversity, NSs proteins examined thus far have been found to play roles in the suppression of the host innate immune response. However, this and the diverse mechanisms of NSs function have been studied only for a few viruses. Here we describe the first high-resolution structure of a bunyaviral NSs protein. A truncated stable, soluble core domain spanning residues 83\u2013248 of RVFV NSs ( NSs-\u0394N\u0394C ) was identified using NMR spectroscopy. The corresponding crystal structure represents a novel all-helical fold. Notably, NSs molecules packed in crystals in double-helical fibrils stabilized by multiple interfaces. Dimensions of these fibrils are in good agreement with fibrils constituting nuclear NSs filaments in RVFV-infected cells. Cells infected with recombinant RVFV encoding NSs-\u0394N\u0394C produced nuclear filaments indistinguishable from filaments observed in cells infected with parental RVFV. Furthermore, recombinant viruses encoding full-length NSs with mutations predicted to destabilize significant fibril interfaces, as suggested by crystal packing, did not induce nuclear filaments. Combination of structural biology with cell infection assays using reverse genetics to tailor the main RVFV virulence factor identified a RVFV NSs core domain sufficient for filament formation in vivo, and revealed the structural basis for NSs nuclear filament formation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Rift Valley fever phlebovirus ( RVFV ) is a virus of humans and livestock, transmitted by mosquitos and contact with infected animals. Infection can cause severe disease, including hemorrhagic fever, and may lead to death. Historically, the virus was only found in central Africa but it has spread for instance to the Arabian Peninsula. There is a risk that the virus may appear in temperate regions including Europe because global warming is allowing the mosquitos that carry the virus to extend their geographic range. There are no vaccines or treatments available for use in humans so if there is a serious outbreak of the virus it could become an epidemic and cause great economic losses and severe human disease. RVFV relies on a protein called NSs to cause disease. In cells of infected animals and humans NSs forms filaments inside the nucleus, the control center of the cell, and disarms the immune system. However, it is not known precisely how NSs works. To address this question, Barski, Brennan et al. used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the atomic three-dimensional structure of NSs. This revealed that the center of the protein contains a core domain that causes the filaments to form. Further experiments identified how the NSs core comes together to build the filaments inside the cell nucleus. These findings represent an important step towards understanding how the NSs protein helps RVFV to cause disease in humans and livestock. In the future, this work may aid the development of much needed drugs and vaccines against RVFV ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nWe asked how a new, complex trait evolves by selecting for diurnal oscillations in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We expressed yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) from a yeast promoter and selected for a regular alternation between low and high fluorescence over a 24-hr period. This selection produced changes in cell adhesion rather than YFP expression: clonal populations oscillated between single cells and multicellular clumps. The oscillations are not a response to environmental cues and continue for at least three cycles in a constant environment. We identified eight putative causative mutations in one clone and recreated the evolved phenotype in the ancestral strain. The mutated genes lack obvious relationships to each other, but multiple lineages change from the haploid to the diploid pattern of gene expression. We show that a novel, complex phenotype can evolve by small sets of mutations in genes whose molecular functions appear to be unrelated to each other.  Biological oscillators demand dynamical interactions between multiple components and have evolved many times to drive various behaviors, from heartbeats, on the timescale of seconds, to circadian clocks and seasonal clocks, on the time scale of days and years. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lacks homologs to genes that make up the core oscillator or light-sensing pathways of fungal circadian rhythms ( Brunner and Kaldi, 2008; Idnurm and Heitman, 2010; Salichos and Rokas, 2010 ) and does not display any 24-hr behavior capable of sustained autonomous oscillations in a constant environment ( Eelderink-Chen et al., 2010; Robertson et al., 2013 ). As an example of a novel trait, we evolved a 24-hr oscillator in the budding yeast to determine how biologically complex machinery could evolve from proteins and signaling networks that lack any known connection to oscillatory behavior. Because circadian clocks can be entrained by environmental signals and have a temperature-independent period, whereas the behavior we have evolved represents an autonomous oscillator with a period of roughly 24 hr that controls a biological output, we refer to the circuit we have evolved as a diurnal oscillator, referring to its period, rather than the distinction between day and night.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: In living things, many important behaviors\u2014including animal heartbeats and sleep patterns\u2014happen in cycles. Machines called oscillators, which are found inside cells, control these behaviors. There are many different oscillators and they share some common features, despite involving different genes. Each oscillator is formed of a set of genes that interact with each other to drive regular cycles lasting seconds, hours, or even months. The oscillators do not need any cues from the environment to maintain these cycles. However, cues such as light or temperature can keep the oscillator synchronized with the environment. To ask how complex machines like oscillators could evolve, Wildenberg and Murray inserted a gene that makes a fluorescent protein into budding yeast, a single-celled species that does not have an oscillator with a period of 24 hr. These yeast cells were then selectively grown through a few hundred generations to experimentally evolve a yeast strain where the levels of protein fluorescence regularly alternated over 24-hr periods. Wildenberg and Murray then carried out further experiments to discover the cause of the pattern of protein fluorescence. These revealed that the pattern was due to the yeast cells alternating between forming clumps of multiple cells and living separately. The genes that mutated to create the cycles of cell clumping in the yeast all appear to have unrelated roles. The 24-hr oscillator that evolved in the yeast has some of the features of the biological oscillators found in nature. It maintains regular cycles even without any cues from the environment and it can control a cell behavior, but the oscillator appears to be unable to accept cues from the environment, a universal property of naturally evolved circadian clocks. Further work to understand how the genes work together in the oscillator will help to better understand how 24-hr oscillators in nature can evolve from genes that lack any 24-hr behavior ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nRNA-protein ( RNP ) granules have been proposed to assemble by forming solid RNA/protein aggregates or through phase separation into a liquid RNA/protein phase. Which model describes RNP granules in living cells is still unclear. In this study, we analyze P bodies in budding yeast and find that they have liquid-like properties. Surprisingly, yeast stress granules adopt a different material state, which is reminiscent of solid protein aggregates and controlled by protein disaggregases. By using an assay to ectopically nucleate RNP granules, we further establish that RNP granule formation does not depend on amyloid-like aggregation but rather involves many promiscuous interactions. Finally, we show that stress granules have different properties in mammalian cells, where they show liquid-like behavior. Thus, we propose that the material state of RNP granules is flexible and that the solid state of yeast stress granules is an adaptation to extreme environments, made possible by the presence of a powerful disaggregation machine.  The organization of the intracellular space into compartments is fundamental to life; it allows cells to perform complex biochemical reactions in a confined and controlled manner. In addition to membrane-delimited organelles, such as the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum, the cytoplasm contains compartments that are not surrounded by membranes. These non-membrane-bound compartments are frequently linked to gene expression pathways and often contain substantial amounts of RNAs ( Hyman and Brangwynne, 2011; Weber and Brangwynne, 2012; Brangwynne, 2013; Hyman et al., 2014 ). Examples in the nucleus include chromatin domains, the nucleolus, and Cajal bodies; examples in the cytoplasm are P bodies, stress granules, and germ granules. Although their functions are not always clear, it is assumed that they facilitate or suppress specific biochemical reactions. Recent studies proposed that P granules\u2014RNA-protein ( RNP ) granules in germ cells of Caenorhabditis elegans\u2014form by liquid\u2013liquid demixing or phase separation from the cytoplasm, so that two phases, a liquid droplet phase and the cytoplasm coexist ( Brangwynne et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2013 ). Such demixed phases of proteins and RNAs may turn out to be a unifying principle of subcellular organization ( Weber and Brangwynne, 2012; Brangwynne, 2013; Hyman et al., 2014 ). Indeed, recent findings show that liquid phase separation is not limited to P granules ( Brangwynne et al., 2011; Aggarwal et al., 2013; Feric and Brangwynne, 2013; Hubstenberger et al., 2013; Wippich et al., 2013; Banjade and Rosen, 2014 ). Importantly, defined mixtures of RNAs and proteins can also phase separate in a cell-free system, driven by multivalent interactions ( Li et al., 2012 ). This suggests that many cellular components may have an intrinsic ability to phase separate and assemble into structures with liquid-like properties. Despite recent evidence for a liquid-like state, others have argued that RNP granules have more solid material characteristics, similar to protein aggregates ( Gilks et al., 2004; Vessey et al., 2006; Decker et al., 2007; Si et al., 2010; Decker and Parker, 2012; Ramaswami et al., 2013 ). This seems particularly likely for P bodies and stress granules, which are stress-inducible RNP granules containing non-translating RNAs and protein factors involved in translation repression or mRNA decay ( Anderson and Kedersha, 2009; Decker and Parker, 2012 ). P bodies and stress granules form as a response to acute stress conditions, when a cell has to make arrangements to divert valuable resources to cellular survival, and their formation coincides with the formation of protein aggregates, which result from stress-induced protein misfolding. Proteins contained in P bodies or stress granules are characteristically composed of two types of domains: RNA-binding domains ( RBDs ) and domains of low sequence complexity; the latter are also referred to as prion-like ( Gilks et al., 2004; Decker et al., 2007; Reijns et al., 2008; King et al., 2012; Malinovska et al., 2013 ). This term is derived from the fact that they have a characteristic amino acid composition ( mostly polar amino acids such as serine, glycine, asparagine, glutamine and tyrosine ), which resembles that of yeast prions. Prion domains ( PDs ) and prion-like domains ( PLDs ) have little structure under normal conditions. However, they can undergo spontaneous conversions into an aggregated state, which is characterized by a cross-\u03b2 structure and referred to as amyloid ( Alberti et al., 2009 ). Once formed, the amyloid state can act as a template for the incorporation of further proteins, but it can also be reversed through energy-expending protein disaggregation machines ( Doyle et al., 2013 ). Despite some recent progress, RNP granule assembly remains a poorly understood molecular process. In particular, it is not known how RBDs and PLDs cooperate to promote RNP granule formation in living cells. Recent cell-free reconstitution experiments seem to confirm that PLDs in RNP granule components can assemble into amyloid-like fibers and undergo sol\u2013gel or liquid\u2013solid phase transitions ( Han et al., 2012; Kato et al., 2012; Kwon et al., 2013, 2014 ). However, PLDs can also cause protein-misfolding diseases, which are typically accompanied by solid RNP aggregates ( Li et al., 2013; Ramaswami et al., 2013 ). These pathological RNP aggregates are similar to those observed in cell-free reconstitution experiments, raising important questions about the relationship of physiological and pathological RNP granules in living cells. More insight into this topic is also desirable in light of the fact that two different models have been proposed to explain RNP granule assembly, which make very different predictions about the material state of RNP granules ( liquid vs solid ) and their mode of assembly ( phase separation vs aggregation ). In this study, we analyze P bodies and stress granules in budding yeast and mammalian cells. To our surprise, we find a high degree of versatility in RNP granule assembly. We show that physiological RNP granules can have different material properties and behave as liquid-like droplets or solid protein aggregates. We further establish a key role for RNA in RNP granule assembly and demonstrate that PLDs in RNA-binding proteins promote RNP granule formation in a manner that does not involve amyloid-like aggregation. Instead, these domains undergo promiscuous interactions, with other PLDs or with misfolded proteins. We further reveal a central role for ATP-driven disaggregases in maintaining the identity and integrity of RNP granules and propose that the presence of the Hsp104 disaggregase in yeast has enabled the evolution of a unique pathway for RNP granule formation, which resembles a typical protein aggregation reaction.

In most cells, RNA molecules are present within a structure called ribonucleoprotein ( RNP for short ) granules. These contain the protein machinery needed to transport, store, and break down RNAs. P bodies and stress granules are two types of RNP granules found in all cells, from yeast to human. P bodies are present at all times, whereas stress granules assemble when a cell experiences stressful conditions, such as a lack of nutrients or high temperatures. Once the stress has been overcome, the stress granules are disassembled. The precise details of how RNP granules assemble in cells remain poorly understood. One theory suggests that RNP granules form through a physical process called \u2018phase separation\u2019 in which RNA molecules and proteins above a certain critical concentration condense to form a liquid droplet. Other research has suggested that RNP granules arise when so-called prion-like proteins spontaneously clump together and start aggregating to form fibers. These granules would behave more like solids than liquids. Kroschwald et al. have now analyzed how P bodies and stress granules form in yeast and human cells using a chemical compound that can distinguish between liquid-like and solid-like structures. The results revealed that P bodies and stress granules behave very differently in yeast cells. While P bodies are indeed liquid droplets, stress granules are more solid in nature and act like protein aggregates. So why is there a difference between the two ? It is known from previous work that when cells are stressed, many proteins misfold and start aggregating. Kroschwald et al. found that the formation of stress granules coincides with the formation of aggregates, suggesting that stress granules themselves are a type of aggregate. Furthermore, stress granule formation does not seem to involve prion-like fibers, but rather prion-like proteins can easily interact with other proteins in a promiscuous way, thus promoting the seeding of stress granules and their growth. Kroschwald et al. next studied human cells and observed that in these cells, both P bodies and stress granules were liquid droplets. These results together suggest that the physical properties and method of assembling P bodies and stress granules can vary from one organism to another. Future work will investigate whether the ability to form solid rather than liquid stress granules provides extra protection to yeast cells when they are stressed. It also remains to be tested whether and how stress granules convert into the pathological RNP aggregates that are often seen in neurodegenerative diseases ."}

In this study, we investigated the function of the Kinesin I heavy chain Kif5aa during retinotectal circuit formation in zebrafish. Targeted disruption of Kif5aa does not affect retinal ganglion cell differentiation, and retinal axons reach their topographically correct targets in the tectum, albeit with a delay. In vivo dynamic imaging showed that anterograde transport of mitochondria is impaired, as is synaptic transmission. Strikingly, disruption of presynaptic activity elicits upregulation of Neurotrophin-3 ( Ntf3 ) in postsynaptic tectal cells. This in turn promotes exuberant branching of retinal axons by signaling through the TrkC receptor ( Ntrk3 ). Thus, our study has uncovered an activity-dependent, retrograde signaling pathway that homeostatically controls axonal branching.  Intracellular transport is an essential process in cell growth, maintenance, and inter- and intracellular signaling. This is especially apparent in highly polarized cells like neurons that are composed of complex dendrites and a long axon responsible for impulse propagation. Most of the proteins, mRNAs, and organelles required for cellular growth and function are produced in the cell body and must, therefore, be moved down the axon to the synaptic terminals. Microtubules serve as main longitudinal cytoskeletal tracks in axons, and it is well established that microtubule stabilization is a landmark of early axonal development that is sufficient to induce axon formation in vivo. Besides, microtubule stabilization alone can even lead to the transformation of mature dendrites into axons in differentiated neurons ( Gomis-Ruth et al., 2008; Witte and Bradke, 2008; Witte et al., 2008 ). Along the axonal microtubule cytoskeleton molecular motors of the kinesin and dynein superfamily act as main transport molecules ( Hirokawa, 1998; Karki and Holzbaur, 1999; Vale, 2003 ). Although it is well established that anterograde molecular motors are essential for synapse generation and function ( Okada et al., 1995 ), little is known about their exact role in neural circuit establishment in vivo. Of the kinesin superfamily, which comprises 45 members in mammals ( Miki et al., 2001 ) and many more in zebrafish, the kinesin I subclass plays an especially prominent role in neuronal function. The kinesin motors mediate the plus end directed transport of cargo proteins along microtubules and are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains ( Hirokawa et al., 2010 ). In the mammalian genome, three kinesin I heavy chain genes are present: Kif5A, Kif5B, and Kif5C. While Kif5B is ubiquitously expressed, Kif5A and Kif5C are neuron-specific ( Xia et al., 1998 ). Their cargoes include voltage-gated potassium channels, AMPA receptor GluR2, GABAA receptors, sodium channels, neurofilaments, and mitochondria ( Rivera et al., 2007; Uchida et al., 2009; Twelvetrees et al., 2010; Karle et al., 2012; Su et al., 2013; Barry et al., 2014 ). In humans, Kif5A mutations have been implicated in a heterogenous group of neurodegenerative disorders, including a form of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia characterized by slowly progressive lower limb paralysis ( Goldstein, 2001 ) and Charcot Marie Tooth Type 2, a peripheral axonal neuropathy ( Crimella et al., 2012 ). In this study, we have taken a combined genetic, molecular biological, and in vivo imaging approach in developing zebrafish larvae to investigate the role of anterograde intracellular transport in the development of connections between retina and tectum. By TALEN-mediated gene disruption, we generated a kif5aa loss-of-function allele and could show that kif5aa mutant fish display a de-synchronisation of retinal axon and tectal growth. A delay in tectal innervation by mutant retinal ganglion cell ( RGC ) axons is followed by a period of exuberant branching, resulting in enlarged axonal arbors. GCaMP imaging revealed that kif5aa mutant RGCs do not transmit signals from the retina to their postsynaptic partner cells. Utilizing two additional zebrafish mutant lines with defects in RGC formation or function, lakritz ( Kay et al., 2001 ) and blumenkohl ( Smear et al., 2007 ), or specific silencing of RGCs by expression of botulinum toxin light chain B ( BoTxLCB ), we show that in all four cases the reduction of presynaptic activity leads to increased expression of neurotrophic factor 3 ( Ntf3 ). The overabundance of this neurotrophin causes excessive branching by RGC axons. Thus, a defect in Kif5aa-mediated axonal transport has unmasked a homeostatic mechanism that adjusts axon arbor growth to levels of synaptic activity and depends on Ntf3 signaling.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Different regions of a neuron have distinct structures and roles. For example, each neuron has a cable-like structure called the axon that extends out of the body of the cell and carries electrical signals away from the cell body. To pass these messages on to neighboring cells, branches on the axon form connections called synapses with other neurons. The axon lacks most of the cellular machinery needed to make proteins and other molecules that the cell needs to work correctly. Therefore, neurons must transport these materials from the cell body\u2014where they are produced\u2014down to the end of the axon. Specialized proteins called molecular motors carry this cargo down the axon along \u2018tracks\u2019 composed of filaments called microtubules. Auer, Xiao et al. have now used genetic techniques to disrupt the gene that encodes an important molecular motor, called Kif5A, in developing zebrafish larvae. The effects of this manipulation on the development of the zebrafish's visual system were then examined. When zebrafish are a few days old, neurons in the retina\u2014the structure at the back of the eye that responds to light\u2014extend axons into a region of the brain called the tectum. The formation of synapses between cells in the retina and the tectum provides a pathway that enables information to travel from the eye to the brain. Auer, Xiao et al. found that in larvae that lack Kif5A, axons from the retina enter the brain about a day later than they do in normal larvae. However, when these mutant axons arrive, they produce large numbers of branches, each with the potential to form multiple synapses with cells in the tectum. However, none of the resulting synapses appear to respond to visual stimuli, which is consistent with the fact that Kif5A mutant larvae are blind. Experiments to identify what triggers the excessive branching of retinal axons revealed that the mutant fish had elevated levels of a growth-promoting protein called neurotrophin-3 in cells in the tectum. This increased production of neurotrophin-3 was also observed when neuronal activity was blocked, for example by toxins. The lack of neuronal activity in retinal axons therefore seems to increase the production of neurotrophin-3, which in turn stimulates axonal branching. Future experiments could investigate the molecular signal that drives this increased production of neurotrophin-3, and how this is regulated during normal neuronal development ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nSynthetic strategies for optically controlling gene expression may enable the precise spatiotemporal control of genes in any combination of cells that cannot be targeted with specific promoters. We develop an improved genetic code expansion system in Caenorhabditis elegans and use it to create a photoactivatable Cre recombinase. We laser-activate Cre in single neurons within a bilaterally symmetric pair to selectively switch on expression of a loxP-controlled optogenetic channel in the targeted neuron. We use the system to dissect, in freely moving animals, the individual contributions of the mechanosensory neurons PLML/PLMR to the C. elegans touch response circuit, revealing distinct and synergistic roles for these neurons. We thus demonstrate how genetic code expansion and optical targeting can be combined to break the symmetry of neuron pairs and dissect behavioural outputs of individual neurons that cannot be genetically targeted.  Genetic code expansion offers the ability to introduce, during translation, functionalities into proteins beyond those offered by the set of canonical, naturally occurring amino acids. This is achieved by providing orthogonal translation components: an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ( aaRS ) paired with a cognate orthogonal tRNA, and assignment of a codon to determine the site of incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid ( ncAA ) ( Chin, 2017 ). The genetic code of several single and multicellular systems has been expanded to date ( Brown et al., 2018a ). Caenorhabditis elegans was the first multicellular organism in which genetic code expansion was established, and the incorporation of ncAA has been demonstrated in multiple C. elegans tissues ( Greiss and Chin, 2011; Parrish et al., 2012 ). Currently available orthogonal systems, however, often lack the efficiency required to fully harness the possibilities offered by genetic code expansion, especially in multicellular systems. A large variety of non-canonical amino acids are available for in vivo use, among them photocaged amino acids, which can be used to confer light-activated control over the function of proteins in a host organism ( Courtney and Deiters, 2018 ). Sequence-specific DNA recombinases, such as Cre and FLP, have become transformative for controlling gene expression in many systems, including worms, flies, and vertebrates, by irreversibly activating or deactivating target gene expression. Indeed, the photo-induced reconstitution of split recombinases ( Schindler et al., 2015; Kawano et al., 2016 ) might be used to optically target recombinase activity to a single cell. However, the sensitivity of this technique can be hampered by high background levels of light-independent recombinase activity. Moreover, these systems are induced using blue light, rendering their use incompatible with most optogenetic and imaging applications, and requiring cells to be kept in the dark, complicating their use in transparent model systems. Recently, genetic code expansion methods were used to create photocaged versions of Cre in cultured mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos ( Luo et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2018b ). In photocaged Cre, an orthogonal aaRS/tRNACUA pair is used to replace a catalytically critical tyrosine or lysine residue in the active site of Cre with a photocaged tyrosine or lysine residue, resulting in a catalytically inactive enzyme ( Luo et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2018b ). The photocaging group can then be removed through a short exposure to 365 nm UV light, activating Cre recombinase, which in turn activates expression of its target genes. We set out to create an optimised photocaged Cre system that enables the optical activation of gene expression in single cells in an animal. The precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression offered by photocaged Cre would have a wide range of applications by allowing the expression of genes of interest in single cells or combinations of cells. Applied to control, for example, optogenetic channels or other neuromodulatory proteins, it could be a transformative tool in neurobiology. Defining the molecular and cellular basis of behaviour is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. C. elegans contains 302 neurons, for which the physical connectivity has been determined ( White et al., 1986 ). This physical map provides a conceptual framework within which to design experiments to understand the signal processing properties of neural circuits that define behaviour. Central to this endeavour are methods for the spatiotemporal control of gene expression that enable precise perturbations to be effected in individual cells or combinations of cells and thereby advance our understanding of cellular contributions to circuit function. Two thirds of the neurons in C. elegans exist in bilaterally symmetric ( left and right ) pairs, and similar gross morphological symmetries are seen in the nervous systems of many other animals. A central question is whether and how this morphological symmetry is broken to produce functional asymmetry ( Troemel et al., 1999; Wes and Bargmann, 2001; Suzuki et al., 2008; Hobert et al., 2002 ). Tissue-specific promoters ( alone or in combination ) can be used to target groups of cells. However, this approach offers only limited precision, and in many cases appropriate promoters are unavailable; especially in scenarios when investigators aim to limit expression to a single cell or a defined subset of cells. This is particularly limiting in neuroscience studies where the goal is to couple neuronal activity of single neurons or a defined subset of neurons with functional output. Where specific promoters for targeting individual neurons are unavailable, laser ablation can be used to remove specific neurons, but this technology is not compatible with studying intact circuits. Optogenetic approaches using targeted illumination have been applied to stimulate groups or pairs of cells, and track resulting behavioural outputs in freely moving C. elegans ( Leifer et al., 2011; Stirman et al., 2011; Kocabas et al., 2012 ). However, without a means of precisely defining expression of optogenetic tools, this approach is technically very challenging as it requires specialised software and hardware tools for real-time tracking and targeting and does not lend itself to isolating single cells in neuronal pairs. Similar obstacles are encountered in other systems, where the solution often also requires technically challenging approaches utilising targeted illumination ( Chen et al., 2018 ). Here we describe the optimisation of genetic code expansion for ncAA incorporation and the optimisation of a photocaged Cre recombinase variant ( optPC-Cre ) in C. elegans. The combination of these advances allows us to optically control gene expression with unprecedented precision and over 95% efficiency in a population of animals ( compared to less than 1% efficiency before optimisation ). By using a microscope-mounted 365 nm laser, we photo-activate Cre and thereby control gene expression in single cells ( Figure 1 ). We name this approach Laser Targeted Activation of Cre-Lox recombination ( LaserTAC ). LaserTAC is fast and within the technical capabilities of any lab currently able to perform laser ablation, allowing easy generation, in a single session, of dozens of animals with defined expression patterns for use in downstream experiments. We demonstrate the utility of LaserTAC by using it to target the expression of optogenetic channels to individual C. elegans touch sensory neurons within a left/right pair ( PLML and PLMR ). These individual neurons cannot be targeted by other methods, and our approach allows us to study their contribution to behaviour for the first time. Our results reveal that the PLM neurons act in synergy to produce a robust touch response requiring input from both neurons. Furthermore, the individual neurons within this pair make asymmetric contributions to the touch response, suggesting distinct roles for PLMR and PLML in the habituation to repeated stimulation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Animal behaviour and movement emerges from the stimulation of nerve cells that are connected together like a circuit. Researchers use various tools to investigate these neural networks in model organisms such as roundworms, fruit flies and zebrafish. The trick is to activate some nerve cells, but not others, so as to isolate their specific role within the neural circuit. One way to do this is to switch genes on or off in individual cells as a way to control their neuronal activity. This can be achieved by building a photocaged version of the enzyme Cre recombinase which is designed to target specific genes. The modified Cre recombinase contains an amino acid ( the building blocks of proteins ) that inactivates the enzyme. When the cell is illuminated with UV light, a part of the amino acid gets removed allowing Cre recombinase to turn on its target gene. However, cells do not naturally produce these photocaged amino acids. To overcome this, researchers can use a technology called genetic code expansion which provides cells with the tools they need to build proteins containing these synthetic amino acids. Although this technique has been used in live animals, its application has been limited due to the small amount of proteins it produces. Davis et al. therefore set out to improve the efficiency of genetic code expansion so that it can be used to study single nerve cells in freely moving roundworms. In the new system, named LaserTAC, individual cells are targeted with UV light that \u2018uncages\u2019 the Cre recombinase enzyme so it can switch on a gene for a protein that controls neuronal activity. Davis et al. used this approach to stimulate a pair of neurons sensitive to touch to see how this impacted the roundworm\u2019s behaviour. This revealed that individual neurons within this pair contribute to the touch response in different ways. However, input from both neurons is required to produce a robust reaction. These findings show that the LaserTAC system can be used to manipulate gene activity in single cells, such as neurons, using light. It allows researchers to precisely control in which cells and when a given gene is switched on or off. Also, with the improved efficiency of the genetic code expansion, this technology could be used to modify proteins other than Cre recombinase and be applied to other artificial amino acids that have been developed in recent years ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nHomotypic or entotic cell-in-cell invasion is an integrin-independent process observed in carcinoma cells exposed during conditions of low adhesion such as in exudates of malignant disease. Although active cell-in-cell invasion depends on RhoA and actin, the precise mechanism as well as the underlying actin structures and assembly factors driving the process are unknown. Furthermore, whether specific cell surface receptors trigger entotic invasion in a signal-dependent fashion has not been investigated. In this study, we identify the G-protein-coupled LPA receptor 2 ( LPAR2 ) as a signal transducer specifically required for the actively invading cell during entosis. We find that G12/13 and PDZ-RhoGEF are required for entotic invasion, which is driven by blebbing and a uropod-like actin structure at the rear of the invading cell. Finally, we provide evidence for an involvement of the RhoA-regulated formin Dia1 for entosis downstream of LPAR2. Thus, we delineate a signaling process that regulates actin dynamics during cell-in-cell invasion.  Entosis has been described as a specialized form of homotypic cell-in-cell invasion in which one cell actively crawls into another ( Overholtzer et al., 2007 ). Frequently, this occurs between tumor cells such as breast, cervical, or colon carcinoma cells and can be triggered by matrix detachment ( Overholtzer et al., 2007 ), suggesting that loss of integrin-mediated adhesion may promote cell-in-cell invasion. This is further supported by the fact that homotypic cell-in-cell structures can be regularly found when tumor cells are released into fluid exudates such as ascites or during pleural carcinosis ( Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008 ). Although the consequence of entotic invasion is not well understood, the process may contribute to tumor progression by inducing aneuploidy in human cancers ( Krajcovic et al., 2011 ). The ultimate outcome of an entotic event also depends on the fate of the invaded cell, which can remain viable or even divide inside or escape from the host cell or undergo vacuolar degradation ( Florey et al., 2010; Krajcovic et al., 2011 ). It was previously shown that for a cell to invade into a neighboring cell Rho-dependent signaling and actin are required ( Overholtzer et al., 2007 ). However, potential extracellular ligands or cell surface receptors involved in this migratory process are entirely unknown. Furthermore, what type of actin structures and which actin polymerization factor triggers active cell-in-cell invasion in a signal-regulated fashion remained unclear. In this study, we investigated actin-mediated entotic invasion and delineate a signaling pathway downstream of the LPAR2 that ultimately targets the formin mDia1 for polarized actin assembly at the rear of the invading cell to drive cell-in-cell invasion.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Entosis is the invasion of one cell by another and can be observed in aggressive cancers. Although the invading cell is usually killed, the surviving cell is sometimes left with the wrong number of chromosomes. This suggests that entosis may help cancer to progress because cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes are common in cancers. For entosis to occur, the invading cell must be released from the tissue that surrounds it, so it can move towards and attach to the cell it is about to invade. Very little is currently known about the cellular and molecular events that enable these processes to occur. Purvanov et al. studied entosis in cells grown in the laboratory and observed that invading cells produce bulges and projections at their rear end for invasion. These projections contain a protein called mDia1. This protein is involved in controlling the growth of the cytoskeleton\u2014the structure that helps cells to both maintain their shape and to move. Adding the signaling molecule lysophosphatidic acid, which is present in human serum, increased the likelihood that cells would invade others. From this, Purvanov et al. established the identities of the proteins involved in transmitting the lysophosphatidic acid signal that controls mDia1 activity during entosis. Changes to this signaling pathway have been associated with cancer and how it spreads between different organs and its involvement in entosis lends further support to the notion that there may be a link between cell-in-cell invasion and the advancement of cancer ."}

Factors that function to harmonize growth with photoperiod are poorly understood. Here we characterize a new protein that associates with both circadian clock and photoreceptor components, named PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL1 ( PCH1 ). pch1 seedlings have overly elongated hypocotyls specifically under short days while constitutive expression of PCH1 shortens hypocotyls independent of day length. PCH1 peaks at dusk, binds phytochrome B ( phyB ) in a red light-dependent manner, and co-localizes with phyB into photobodies. PCH1 is necessary and sufficient to promote the biogenesis of large photobodies to maintain an active phyB pool after light exposure, potentiating red-light signaling and prolonging memory of prior illumination. Manipulating PCH1 alters PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 levels and regulates light-responsive gene expression. Thus, PCH1 is a new factor that regulates photoperiod-responsive growth by integrating the clock with light perception pathways through modulating daily phyB-signaling.  Plants have evolved to coordinate physiology and phenology with seasonal variation in the environment ( Wilczek et al., 2010 ). These adaptations to changing day length are called photoperiodic responses, which are regulated by both the circadian clock and specific signaling pathways, including light sensory systems ( Shim and Imaizumi, 2015 ). In plants, photoperiod regulates myriad processes, including the transition to flowering ( Valverde et al., 2004 ), cold acclimation ( Lee and Thomashow, 2012 ), and growth ( Niwa et al., 2009; Nomoto et al., 2012 ). In Arabidopsis, daily hypocotyl elongation is accelerated in short days compared to long day conditions, and requires both the circadian clock and light signals to properly react to changing photoperiods ( Niwa et al., 2009; Nozue et al., 2007 ). Circadian clocks provide an adaptive advantage by synchronizing internal physiology to the external environment, allowing for an efficient allocation of resources in plants ( Dodd et al., 2005 ). More than 20 clock components have been characterized in Arabidopsis, forming a complex network of interlocking transcription-translation feedback loops ( Hsu and Harmer, 2014; Nagel and Kay, 2012; Pokhilko et al., 2012 ). Among them, a tripartite protein complex named the Evening Complex ( EC ) regulates circadian rhythms and suppresses hypocotyl growth in the evening ( Nusinow et al., 2011 ). Mutations in any of the EC components, EARLY FLOWERING 3 ( ELF3 ) ( Hicks et al., 2001 ), EARLY FLOWERING 4 ( ELF4 ) ( Doyle et al., 2002 ) or LUX ARRHYTHMO ( LUX ) ( Hazen et al., 2005; Onai and Ishiura, 2005 ), leads to arrhythmic circadian oscillations, elongated hypocotyls, and early flowering regardless of day length ( Nagel and Kay, 2012 ). The EC regulates hypocotyl elongation by repressing the expression of two critical bHLH transcription factors PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 and 5 ( PIF4 and PIF5 ) ( Nusinow et al., 2011 ), which are two key regulators in phytochrome-mediated light signaling pathways ( Huq and Quail, 2002; Khanna et al., 2004 ). Furthermore, ELF3 directly binds to the red light photoreceptor phytochrome B ( phyB ) ( Liu et al., 2001 ) and the E3-ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 ( COP1 ) ( Yu et al., 2008 ), connecting the clock to light signaling. Arabidopsis possesses five red/far-red light absorbing phytochromes ( phyA to E ) ( Clack et al., 1994; Sharrock and Quail, 1989 ). Phytochromes are converted to the Pfr ( active ) form upon red ( 660 nm ) light treatment, and reverted to the Pr ( inactive ) form either upon far-red ( 730 nm ) light exposure or by incubation in the dark in a process termed dark reversion ( Rockwell et al., 2006 ). Signaling through phytochromes regulates germination, shade avoidance, circadian rhythms, photosynthesis, hypocotyl growth and flowering time ( Kami et al., 2010 ). During the day, phytochromes play a prominent role sensing environmental light signals to suppress growth: phyB in the Pfr state binds to PIFs ( such as PIF3, 4 and 5 ) to regulate their post-translational turnover ( Bauer et al., 2004; Lorrain et al., 2008; Nozue et al., 2007 ). Taken together, daily growth rhythms in seedlings are the result of both post-translational degradation of PIF3, 4, and 5 by phytochromes ( Lorrain et al., 2008; Soy et al., 2012 ) and transcriptional regulation of PIF4 and PIF5 by the EC ( Nozue et al., 2007; Nusinow et al., 2011 ). Photoconversion of phyB by red light induces its localization to discrete subnuclear domains named photobodies ( Chen and Chory, 2011; Chen et al., 2003 ). Light conditions that drive the Pr/Pfr equilibrium towards Pfr will promote formation of large photobodies in vivo ( Chen et al., 2003 ), which correlates with the photoinhibition of hypocotyl elongation and the degradation of PIF3 ( Chen et al., 2003; Van Buskirk et al., 2014 ). Since proper degradation of PIFs is critical to regulate growth ( Al-Sady et al., 2006; Lorrain et al., 2008 ), one proposed function of photobodies is to stabilize the phyB Pfr form, which allows active phyB to continue controlling the level of PIFs and suppressing hypocotyl growth in prolonged darkness or in short-days ( Rausenberger et al., 2010; Van Buskirk et al., 2014 ). Current mathematical models of red-light signaling dynamics predict a yet undiscovered factor that directly modulates photobody formation in vivo in response to light ( Klose et al., 2015 ). Here we present the characterization of an EC-associated protein called PCH1 ( for PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL 1 ). Our results define PCH1 as a new clock-regulated phytochrome-binding factor that regulates photoperiodic growth by stabilizing phyB-containing photobodies in the evening, thereby providing a molecular mechanism for prolonging red-light signaling after prior light exposure.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Most living things possess an internal \u201ccircadian\u201d clock that synchronizes many behaviors, such as eating, resting or growing, with the day-night cycle. With the help of proteins that can detect light, known as photoreceptors, the clock also coordinates these behaviors as the number of daylight hours changes during the year. However, it is not known how the clock and photoreceptors are able to work together. The circadian clocks of animals and plants have evolved separately and use different proteins. In plants, a photoreceptor called phytochrome B responds to red light and regulates the ability of plants to grow. Most plants harness sunlight during the day, but grow fastest in the dark just before dawn. In 2015, researchers identified a new protein in a plant called Arabidopsis that is associated with several plant clock proteins and photoreceptors, including phytochrome B. However, the role of this new protein was not clear. Now, Huang et al. \u2013 including many of the researchers from the 2015 work \u2013 studied the new protein, named PCH1, in more detail. The experiments show that PCH1 is a critical link that regulates the daily growth of Arabidopsis plants in response to the number of daylight hours. PCH1 stabilizes the structure of phytochrome B so that it remains active, even in the dark. This prolonged activity acts as a molecular memory of prior exposure to light and helps to prevent plants from growing too much in the winter when there are fewer hours of daylight. Since PCH1 is also found in other species of plants, it may play the same role in regulating growth of major crop plants. The next challenge is to understand how the binding of PCH1 to phytochrome B alters the photoreceptor\u2019s activity. In the future, Huang et al. hope to find out if manipulating the activity of PCH1 can improve the growth of crops in places where there is a large change in day length across the seasons ."}

Using this panel, we evaluated RAS pathway inhibitors and drug combinations that are currently in clinical trial for RAS mutant cancers. Presence of mutant RAS correlated strongly with resistance to these targeted therapies. This was observed in tumorigenic as well as in normal organoids. Moreover, dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway in RAS mutant organoids induced a transient cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant organoids confirmed this growth arrest upon pan-HER/MEK combination therapy. Altogether, our studies demonstrate the potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting.  One of the great challenges in targeted cancer treatment has been the development of effective RAS-targeting drugs. RAS mutations occur in about 15% of all human tumors ( Bos, 1989 ) and so far all attempts to selectively interfere in mutant RAS signaling have failed in the clinic ( Stephen et al., 2014; Cox et al., 2014 ). Progress has long been impeded by the fact that the currently used model systems to pre-test drugs are insufficient: cell lines, on the one hand, have very limited genetic diversity, while mouse models on the other hand, may not represent human tumors ( Sachs and Clevers, 2014; Gould et al., 2015 ). Moreover, until recently, personalized medicine required large-scale in-vitro screening on short-term cultures of tumor sections ( Centenera et al., 2013 ), or alternatively, resource-intensive in-vivo screens using xenotransplantation of tumors into immunodeficient mice ( Jin et al., 2010; Tentler et al., 2012 ). Recently, stem-cell based organoid technology was introduced to establish long-term cultures of both normal and tumor tissues from various organs ( Sato et al., 2009, 2011; Bartfeld et al., 2015; Boj et al., 2015; Huch et al., 2015; Karthaus et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2014 ). The advantage of this technology is that it can capture the genetic diversity of both normal and tumor tissues. Indeed, for colorectal cancer ( CRC ) a genetically diverse Biobank of patient-derived CRC organoids was established and used to integrate genomic data and monotherapy drug responses at the level of individual patient-derived organoid lines ( van de Wetering et al., 2015 ). We employed this biobank to further explore potential strategies to target mutant RAS, including the combination therapy of pan-HER and MEK inhibition, which is currently tested in clinical trials. We confirm the strong correlation between the presence of mutant RAS and resistance towards EGFR inhibition. Our data reinforce the notion that an oncogenic mutation in RAS is sufficient to confer this resistance independent of cellular status, whether it concerns normal or tumorigenic cells. Moreover, real-time imaging of the resistant drug response at the cellular level reveals predominant cell-cycle arrest in RAS mutant organoids, in contrast with the complete induction of cell death in CRC organoids with WT RAS. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant CRC organoids confirmed the\u00a0arrest in tumor growth upon dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway. Finally, efficient inhibition by dual targeting of the mutant RAS pathway strongly sensitizes for the induction of cell death, as illustrated by minimal addition of BCL inhibition. Our studies demonstrate the strong potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Recent technical advances mean that miniature replicas of many tissues can be grown in the laboratory. These so-called organoids provide scientists with model systems that are not as limited as simple, two-dimensional sheets of cells growing in a petri dish, and less labor and resource intensive than studies using laboratory animals. In particular, organoids grown from tumor cells from cancer patients have been suggested as having numerous advantages over both laboratory-grown cancer cells and mice when it comes to testing potential new anticancer drugs. Mutations in a gene called KRAS are common in many types of cancer including colon cancer. Tumors with these mutations are difficult to treat and so far virtually all attempts to generate compounds that selectively interfere with the KRAS protein encoded by the mutant gene have failed. Instead, drugs that indirectly inhibit this protein\u2019s effects by targeting other proteins in the same signaling pathway are currently being tested on patients. However, there is still a need for better ways to pre-test whether these drugs will be effective in humans without having to expose the patient to side effects or an ineffective drug. Now, Verissimo, Overmeer, Ponsioen et al. have tested clinically-used KRAS pathway inhibitors and drug combinations against normal colon organoids and colon cancer organoids derived from patients with colon cancer. Gene editing techniques were used to introduce KRAS mutations into some of the normal organoids grown from healthy tissue, and into cancer organoids grown from tumors that had a normal copy of the KRAS gene. In all cases, only those organoids with mutant forms of the KRAS gene were resistant to the treatments. Furthermore, when organoids with the KRAS mutation were treated with some combination therapies that are currently being tested in clinical trials, the tumors stopped growing but the tumor cells failed to die. Similar drug treatments on mice carrying human colon cancer organoids confirmed these results, which is in line with previous studies where tumor tissue from human patients was transplanted into mice. These findings show that collections of tumor organoids from multiple patients could help researchers to quickly identify and optimize targeted anticancer therapies before they are incorporated into clinical trials. In the future, clinical studies are needed to verify how accurately the testing of cancer drugs on organoids predicts whether the drug will or will not work in patients ."}

Multiple mechanisms contribute to NMJ repair and maintenance; however muscle stem cells ( satellite cells, SCs ), are deemed to have little impact on these processes. Therefore, the applicability of SC studies to attenuate muscle loss due to NMJ deterioration as observed in neuromuscular diseases and aging is ambiguous. We employed mice with an inducible Cre, and conditionally expressed DTA to deplete or GFP to track SCs. We found SC depletion exacerbated muscle atrophy and type transitions connected to neuromuscular disruption. Also, elevated fibrosis and further declines in force generation were specific to SC depletion and neuromuscular disruption. Fate analysis revealed SC activity near regenerating NMJs. Moreover, SC depletion aggravated deficits in reinnervation and post-synaptic morphology at regenerating NMJs. Therefore, our results propose a mechanism whereby further NMJ and skeletal muscle decline ensues upon SC depletion and neuromuscular disruption.  Skeletal muscle is composed of long multinucleated cells, muscle fibers ( myofibers ), which function as primary effectors for force production and contribute to the regulation of whole body metabolism. Although primarily a post-mitotic tissue, adult skeletal muscle possesses a remarkable capacity for regeneration. This capacity is endowed by a population of resident stem cells, satellite cells ( SCs ), identified by the expression of the paired box transcription factor Pax7 ( Tajbakhsh, 2009; Brack and Rando, 2012; Yin et al., 2013 ). In adults, SCs normally reside in a quiescent state at the interface between the myofiber and overlying basal lamina ( Yin et al., 2013 ). However, in response to degenerative stimuli, Pax7+ SCs activate and divide to produce myogenic progenitors for skeletal muscle regeneration ( Tajbakhsh, 2009; Yin et al., 2013 ). Since the initial identification of SCs over 50 years ago, many studies have examined roles for these cells in a plethora of distinct models of skeletal muscle injury, adaptability and disease ( Mauro, 1961; Relaix and Zammit, 2012 ). Both depletion of Pax7+ SCs and targeted disruption of Pax7 have shown these cells to be an essential source of myonuclei for skeletal muscle regeneration ( Relaix and Zammit, 2012; Gunther et al., 2013; von Maltzahn et al., 2013; Lepper et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2011 ). Depletion studies have revealed roles for Pax7+ SCs in late stages of experimentally induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy ( Fry et al., 2014 ). Recently, SCs were also shown to function as a source of growth factors to facilitate bone fracture healing ( Abou-Khalil et al., 2015 ). Similar strategies have shown SCs contribute to myofibers and regulate aspects of skeletal muscle integrity during aging ( Fry et al., 2015; Keefe et al., 2015 ). In adults, each myofiber is innervated by a single axon from a motor neuron ( Sanes and Lichtman, 1999 ). Innervation occurs at a specialized site in the central region of myofibers, the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) ( Sanes and Lichtman, 1999; Wu et al., 2010 ). The NMJ, which occupies approximately 0. 1% of the surface area of a myofiber, initiates action potential propagation required for excitation/contraction coupling to generate force for movement and maintain myofiber properties ( Sanes and Lichtman, 1999; Bassel-Duby and Olson, 2006; Wu et al., 2010; Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011 ). Consistent with a vital role for NMJ integrity in skeletal muscle maintenance, neuromuscular disruptions elicit severe myofiber atrophy, and are frequently associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction observed in the context of neuromuscular diseases ( NMDs ) and aging ( Murray et al., 2010; Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2014; Moloney et al., 2014 ). The regeneration of NMJs in response to peripheral nerve lesions can occur, however the length and quality of recovery depends on the severity of injury ( Buti et al., 1996; Williams et al., 2009 ). Remarkably, the initial reinnervation of synaptic basal lamina by motor axons can proceed in the absence of myofibers ( Sanes et al., 1978; Sanes and Lichtman, 1999 ). However, in the absence of myofibers and associated SCs, the continued maintenance of reinnervated NMJs on basal lamina ghosts eventually declines ( Sanes et al., 1978; Sanes and Lichtman, 1999 ). These observations indicate that myofiber derived factors or associated SCs may be required for the continued differentiation and maintenance of regenerated NMJs. Accordingly, myofiber components and derived factors have been identified to assist in the progressive differentiation of developing and regenerating NMJs ( Sanes and Lichtman, 1999; Fox et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2009 ). In models of chronic denervation, where reinnervation is prevented, SCs activate and divide; however, the derived progenitors migrate into interstitial spaces, undergo defective differentiation or are lost via apoptosis ( Dedkov et al., 2001; Borisov et al., 2005; Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008 ). Furthermore, little turnover of myonuclei and fusion of myogenic progenitors to chronically denervated parent myofibers have been observed ( Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008 ). Collectively, these studies have suggested SCs have limited, if any, roles in the regeneration of NMJs upon neuromuscular disruptions ( Gundersen and Bruusgaard, 2008 ). Through the use of targeted genetic strategies we sought to reexamine the fates and roles of SCs in a model of peripheral nerve injury that enables NMJ regeneration. In this study we find a limited proportion of SCs activate and divide during NMJ reestablishment. Remarkably, while SC depletion did not lead to additional loss of skeletal muscle mass, it was sufficient to reduce myofiber size, increase inter-myofiber connective tissue ( MCT ) accumulation, and aggravate myofiber type transitions connected to NMJ disruption. These phenotypes were associated with further declines in force generation capacity. Examination of fate revealed increased SC activity and fusion of indelibly labeled SC-derived progenitors to myofibers predominantly in the vicinity of regenerating NMJs. Consistent with a role for SCs in the regeneration of NMJs, we found that SC depletion led to deficits in NMJ reinnervation, reductions in post-synaptic morphology and loss of post-synaptic myonuclei. Collectively our findings reveal fates and roles for SCs in the regeneration of NMJs and regulation of skeletal muscle integrity upon neuromuscular disruption.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: New muscle fibers are made throughout our lives to replace those that have been damaged by normal wear and tear, and to meet new physical demands. These new muscle fibers develop from a pool of muscle stem cells. To create and maintain fully working muscles, nerve cells called motor neurons must also properly attach to the muscle fibers. These nerve cells transmit messages from the brain that tell the muscles what to do. If the muscle-nerve connections do not form correctly, or are severed, muscles can waste away. This may occur as part of a neuromuscular disease, and also happens to some extent as a normal part of aging. It was thought that muscle stem cells do not affect how the muscle-nerve connections form. By studying genetically engineered mice, Liu et al. now show that this is not the case. These mice had modifications to their muscle stem cells that allowed the number of these cells to be artificially reduced, and some cells also produced a fluorescent protein that allowed them to be tracked. Surgically severing some of the muscle-nerve connections in the mice triggered the rebuilding of the connections, but also weakened the muscles and caused some disease-related changes in the muscle tissue. During the healing process, the muscle stem cells are active near the regenerating connections. Reducing the number of muscle stem cells in the mice while these broken connections were healing further weakened the muscles. Closer inspection of the muscle-nerve connections also revealed poorer quality connections were formed in the stem-cell deficient mice. Further study of how stem cells help to form strong nerve-muscle connections may allow scientists to develop new treatments for age- or disease-related muscle loss ."}

In fact, deficits in voice impair the quality of life for a large and diverse population of patients. Understanding the molecular genetic mechanisms of development and function in the vocal apparatus is thus an important challenge with relevance both to the basic biology of animal communication and to biomedicine. However, surprisingly little is known about the developmental biology of the mammalian larynx. Here, we used genetic fate mapping to chart the embryological origins of the tissues in the mouse larynx, and we describe the developmental etiology of laryngeal defects in mice with disruptions in cilia-mediated Hedgehog signaling. In addition, we show that mild laryngeal defects correlate with changes in the acoustic structure of vocalizations. Together, these data provide key new insights into the molecular genetics of form and function in the mammalian vocal apparatus.  Vocal communication is fundamental to social interaction. Indeed, the voice is so crucial to our quality of life that the neurobiology of speech and language has been hotly studied for decades, as has the developmental biology of the ear. These bodies of work stand in surprising contrast to our still rudimentary understanding of the developmental biology of the organs of vocalization, the larynx and vocal folds. This is true despite the fact that most animal vocalizations, including human speech, are critically dependent upon the\u00a0careful control of airflow though the larynx. In fact, larynx and vocal fold morphology and elasticity are key factors influencing vocalization even in animals with widely divergent mechanisms of sound production ( e. g. audible vocalizations in humans, ultrasound in rodents ). This deficit in our understanding of laryngeal and vocal fold development is significant, because many people who are capable of normal speech still cannot communicate due to defects in voice ( e. g. problems with pitch, loudness, etc. ). Some voice defects arise from acute insults, such as insufficient hydration of the vocal folds in laryngitis sicca or vocal fold hemorrhages resulting from blood vessel ruptures ( Aronson and Bless, 2009 ). Other conditions are hereditary and chronic, such as those arising from mutations in genes encoding the extracellular matrix protein Elastin ( Vaux et al., 2003; Watts et al., 2008 ). All of these conditions impact the voice, thereby impacting patients\u2019 well-being. A wide array of human birth defect syndromes also involve voice defects, and prominent among these are disorders stemming from failure of the Hedgehog ( HH ) signaling pathway, an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cell-cell communication ( Briscoe and Th\u00e9rond, 2013 ). For example, Pallister-Hall Syndrome is caused by mutations in Gli3, a key transducer of HH signals. These patients have hoarse and/or growling voices, and they frequently exhibit laryngeal clefts and bifid epiglottis ( Hall et al., 1980; Tyler, 1985 ). Pallister-Hall Syndrome is known for its variable expressivity, and accordingly, this disorder is also associated with milder laryngeal anomalies ( Ondrey et al., 2000 ). Importantly, laryngeal and voice defects are not limited to Gli3 mutation, but have also been associated with mutation in the related factor Gli2 ( Fran\u00e7a et al., 2010 ), in the Shh transducer Kif7 ( Putoux et al., 2012; Walsh et al., 2013 ), and in Shh itself ( Cohen, 2004 ). Cilia are essential organelles for transduction of HH signals ( Goetz and Anderson, 2010 ), and as a result, voice defects are also commonly associated with ciliopathies, human diseases that share an etiology of defective cilia structure or function ( Hildebrandt et al., 2011 ). For example, a breathy, high-pitched voice is a diagnostic criterion for Bardet-Biedl and Oral-Facial-Digital syndromes, while hoarse voices are diagnostic for Joubert Syndrome ( Beales et al., 1999; Garstecki et al., 1972; Hayes et al., 2008; Maria et al., 1999; Rimoin and Edgerton, 1967 ). Laryngeal defects such as laryngeal stenosis and bifid epiglottis are also common features of other ciliopathies ( Carron, 2006; Hayes et al., 2008; Silengo et al., 1987; Steichen-Gersdorf et al., 1994; Stevens and Ledbetter, 2005 ). Understanding the molecular genetic basis for voice disorders in human birth defect patients is not the only factor motivating a deeper study of laryngeal developmental biology. Indeed, vocal communication is ubiquitous in tetrapod animals, impacting a wide array of behaviors. For example, the Panamanian Tungara frog creates a complex, multi-tonal call that critically influences female mate choice, and this call requires a sexually dimporphic elaboration of the male larynx, the developmental basis of which is entirely unknown ( Griddi-Papp et al., 2006; Ryan and Drewes, 1990 ). So too is the morphology of the songbird syrinx central to sound production, yet almost nothing is known of the developmental biology of this functional cognate of the larynx, despite the key role of bird song as a model for the study of acoustic communication. Likewise, the larynx of mice is central to their production of ultrasonic vocalizations throughout life. Despite the widespread use of mice for studies of developmental biology, the molecular genetics of mouse laryngeal development remain only cursorily poorly defined ( e. g. [B\u00f6se et al., 2002; Lungova et al., 2015] ). Clearly, a deeper understanding of the molecular genetic basis of laryngeal patterning and morphogenesis will inform our understanding of vertebrate animal behaviors involving acoustic communication. In mammals, the larynx and vocal folds are comprised of an elaborate mixture of cartilages, muscles, nerves, and connective tissue ( Harrison, 1995; Henick, 1993; Lungova et al., 2015 ). The flanged circle of the cricoid cartilage, along with the C-shaped thyroid cartilage and intervening paired arytenoid cartilages provide the core of the laryngeal skeleton ( Figure 1, blue, yellow, purple ). Anchored to these are the vocal folds, which are in turn comprised of paired cricoarytenoid, thyroarytenoid, cricothyroid and vocalis muscles ( Figure 1, pink, magenta, grey ), as well as paired vocal ligaments ( Figure 1, dark blue ) and associated loose mesenchyme which we designate as the thyroglottal connective tissue ( Figure 1, green ). The general laryngeal structure is similar across the mammals ( Harrison, 1995; Kaufman, 1992; Roberts, 1975a; Thomas et al., 2009 ), though rodents communicate most commonly in the ultrasonic range, using a mechanism for sound production that is distinct from that generating audible sound ( Mahrt et al., 2016; Roberts, 1975b ). Importantly however, diverse aspects of rodent ultrasound production parallel those of audible vocalizations in other mammals, including tight control of laryngeal muscle activity and mechanical properties of the vocal folds ( Riede, 2011, 2013 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 19153. 003Figure 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 19153. 003 Here, we have characterized severe defects in laryngeal and vocal fold development in ciliopathic Fuz mutant mice, as well as similar though less severe defects in Gli3 mutant mice. To understand the developmental trajectory of these defects, we first performed directed genetic fate mapping of the mouse larynx. We defined the embryonic origins for diverse tissues in the larynx, and also show that that laryngeal defects in both Fuz and Gli3 mutants stem from an invasion of excess neural crest. Finally, we show that viable heterozygous Gli3 mutant mice display quantitative changes in the morphology of the vocal apparatus accompanied by significant changes in the acoustic structure of their ultrasonic vocalizations. Together, these findings provide an improved foundation for molecular genetic studies of development in the mammalian vocal apparatus, establish a genetic animal model for understanding human congenital laryngeal and voice defects, and demonstrate that excess neural crest is a common etiology underlying diverse Hedgehog-related craniofacial defects.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Nearly all animals communicate using sound. In many cases these sounds are in the form of a voice, which in mammals is generated by a specialized organ in the throat called the larynx. Millions of people throughout the world have voice defects that make it difficult for them to communicate. Such defects are distinct from speech defects such as stuttering, and instead result from an inability to control the pitch or volume of the voice. This has a huge impact because our voice is so central to our quality of life. A wide range of human birth defects that are caused by genetic mutations are known to result in voice problems. These include disorders in which the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which allows cells to exchange information, is defective. Projections called cilia that are found on the outside of many cells transmit Hedgehog signals, and birth defects that affect the cilia ( called ciliopathies ) also often result in voice problems. Although the shape of the larynx has a crucial effect on voice, relatively little is known about how it develops in embryos. Mice are often studied to investigate how human embryos develop. By studying mouse embryos that had genetic mutations similar to those seen in humans with ciliopathies, Tabler, Rigney et al. now show that many different tissues interact in complex ways to form the larynx. A specific group of cells known as the neural crest was particularly important. The neural crest helps to form the face and skull and an excess of these cells causes face and skull defects in individuals with ciliopathies. Tabler, Rigney et al. show that having too many neural crest cells can also contribute towards defects in the larynx of mice with ciliopathies, despite the larynx being in the neck. Further investigation showed that the Hedgehog signaling pathway was required for the larynx to develop properly. Furthermore, recordings of the vocalizations of the mutant mice showed that they had defective voices, thus linking the defects in the shape of the larynx with changes in the vocalizations that the mice made. Overall, Tabler, Rigney et al. show that mice can be used to investigate how the genes that control the shape of the larynx affect the voice. The next step will be to use mice to investigate other genetic defects that cause voice defects in humans. Further research in other animals could also help us to understand how the larynx has evolved ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe basal forebrain cholinergic system modulates neuronal excitability and vascular tone throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. This system is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease ( AD ), and drug treatment to enhance cholinergic signaling is widely used as symptomatic therapy in AD. Defining the full morphologies of individual basal forebrain cholinergic neurons has, until now, been technically beyond reach due to their large axon arbor sizes. Using genetically-directed sparse labeling, we have characterized the complete morphologies of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the mouse. Individual arbors were observed to span multiple cortical columns, and to have >1000 branch points and total axon lengths up to 50 cm. In an AD model, cholinergic axons were slowly lost and there was an accumulation of axon-derived material in discrete puncta. Calculations based on published morphometric data indicate that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in humans have a mean axon length of \u223c100 meters.  The mammalian cerebral cortex and hippocampus are densely innervated by cholinergic fibers that originate in the basal forebrain ( Mesulam, 2004 ). Most, if not all, cortical and hippocampal neurons respond to cholinergic signals using muscarinic and/or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors localized to pre- and/or postsynaptic sites. Activation of postsynaptic nicotinic receptors leads to transient depolarizing currents with a high calcium:sodium ratio and activation of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors leads to a sustained reduction in potassium currents, both effects producing a general elevation in excitability ( Lucas-Meunier et al., 2003 ). Additionally, cholinergic activation of muscarinic receptors in the microvasculature leads to the production of nitric oxide, producing vasodilation ( Hamel, 2004 ). A wide variety of experiments in primates, cats, and rodents have implicated cholinergic neurotransmission from the basal forebrain to the cortex and hippocampus in attention, memory, and plasticity. In cat primary visual cortex, cholinergic input enhances neuronal responses to a preferred visual stimulus ( Sato et al., 1987 ), and in rat motor cortex, cholinergic input promotes more complex motor sequences in response to electrical stimulation ( Berg et al., 2005 ). In rat barrel cortex and auditory cortex, cholinergic input is required for experience-dependent synaptic plasticity and circuit reorganization ( Baskerville et al., 1997; Kilgard and Merzenich, 1998; Zhu and Waite, 1998 ). In contrast to the high spatial precision of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, current evidence indicates that the basal forebrain cholinergic system modulates neuronal excitability and vascular tone over large target areas. The basal forebrain cholinergic system is of special interest because it degenerates in a variety of common neurologic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) and Parkinson's disease, to an extent that correlates with the severity of dementia ( Schliebs and Arendt, 2011 ). In advanced AD, the relative loss of cholinergic innervation varies by region, with the temporal lobe showing the greatest loss of fibers and the primary sensory, motor, and anterior cingulate cortices showing the least loss ( Geula and Mesulam, 1989 ). The relative extent of cholinergic fiber loss in different cortical areas appears to correlate inversely with fiber density in the normal brain, suggesting that disease-associated fiber loss progresses at roughly equal rates throughout the cortex and that those regions that began with the fewest fibers are the first to become denuded of cholinergic input. The loss of forebrain cholinergic innervation in AD has stimulated the development of pharmacotherapy to enhance cholinergic signaling as an approach to partially ameliorate cognitive symptoms ( Burns et al., 2006 ). From the preceding paragraphs it is clear that an accurate anatomic description of the basal forebrain cholinergic system is important for understanding its function and its susceptibility to degeneration. At present, this description, which derives from retrograde and anterograde filling and from histochemical and immunohistochemical staining, provides a view that is accurate as a statistical picture but is incomplete in one critical respect: the morphologies of individual cholinergic axon arbors are unknown because their extraordinarily large size has, thus far, precluded classical tracer filling and reconstruction. In earlier work, we demonstrated the utility of extremely sparse CreER/loxP labeling methods for visualizing axonal and dendritic morphologies of large neurons, including forebrain cholinergic neurons ( Rotolo et al., 2008; Badea et al., 2009 ). In the present work, we use this approach to visualize and quantify the full 3-dimensional axonal morphologies of individual forebrain cholinergic neurons and to define changes in these arbors in response to disease progression in a mouse model of AD.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The human brain is made up of roughly 80 to 100 billion neurons, organized into extensive networks. Each neuron consists of a number of components: a cell body, which contains the nucleus; numerous short protrusions from the cell body called dendrites; and a long thin structure called an axon that carries the electrical signals generated in the cell body and the dendrites to the next neuron in the network. One of the most studied networks in the human brain is the basal forebrain network, which is made up of large neurons that communicate with one another using a chemical transmitter called acetylcholine. This network has a key role in cognition, and its neurons are among the first to degenerate in Alzheimer's disease. However, relatively little is known about the structure of these \u2018cholinergic\u2019 neurons because their large size makes them difficult to study using standard techniques. Now, Wu et al. have visualized, for the first time, the complete 3D structure of cholinergic neurons in the mouse forebrain. The mice in question had been genetically modified so that only ten or so of their many thousands of cholinergic neurons expressed a distinctive \u2018marker\u2019 protein. This made it possible to distinguish these neurons from surrounding brain tissue in order to visualize their structures. The resulting pictures clearly illustrate the neurons' complexity, with individual axons in adult mice displaying up to 1000 branches. Measurements showed that each cholinergic axon in the mouse brain is roughly 30 centimeters long, even though the brain itself is less than 2 centimeters from front to back. Based on measurements by other researchers, Wu et al. calculated that the axons of single cholinergic neurons in the human brain are about 100 meters long on average. The extreme length and complex branching structure of cholinergic forebrain neurons helps to explain why each neuron is able to modulate the activity of many others in the network. It could also explain their vulnerability to degeneration, as the need to transport materials over such long distances may limit the ability of these neurons to respond to damage ."}

Yet, even in model systems detailed analysis of numerous developmental processes at cellular level is severely hampered by their scale. For instance, secondary growth of Arabidopsis hypocotyls creates a radial pattern of highly specialized tissues that comprises several thousand cells starting from a few dozen. This dynamic process is difficult to follow because of its scale and because it can only be investigated invasively, precluding comprehensive understanding of the cell proliferation, differentiation, and patterning events involved. To overcome such limitation, we established an automated quantitative histology approach. We acquired hypocotyl cross-sections from tiled high-resolution images and extracted their information content using custom high-throughput image processing and segmentation. Coupled with automated cell type recognition through machine learning, we could establish a cellular resolution atlas that reveals vascular morphodynamics during secondary growth, for example equidistant phloem pole formation.  Model organisms have proven essential for dissecting the molecular-genetic control of biological processes in both animals and plants ( Meyerowitz, 2002; Brenner, 2009 ). Typically, they have been chosen according to a number of criteria, including a small, diploid genome, a short generation time, and easy lab culture. Another frequent feature is their small size, which allows cultivation of numerous individuals to enable large-scale genetic analyses as well as easy observation of developmental processes by microscopy. Fulfilling all these criteria, Arabidopsis thaliana ( Arabidopsis ), a small, annual dicotyledon of the Brassicaceae family, is the model of choice for developmental biology of higher plants ( Meyerowitz, 1989 ). Various central processes of the plant life cycle, for example embryogenesis, root meristem organization or flower development can be examined at high spatio-temporal resolution in Arabidopsis. Moreover, in many instances live imaging at ( sub- ) cellular level is possible through microscopy techniques, including confocal microscopy, which is aided by the transparency of whole organs, such as the root, or at least the outermost tissue layers. However, such investigation is limited by organ depth, which can increase dramatically with organ size. For example, while the meristematic and differentiation regions of the root tip comprise a mere 5\u20136 dozen cells in the radial dimension and can be imaged all across using state-of-the-art microscopes, cell number rapidly increases proximal, towards the mature root ( Dolan et al., 1993 ). At the same time, the organization of the root tissue layers rearranges from a partially radial, partially bilateral symmetry towards full radial symmetry, concomitant with the formation of cylindrical secondary meristems and the replacement of the outer cell layers by a new protective outside tissue. Thus, eventually the mature root acquires the same overall organization as the mature aboveground stems, that is a few cell layers of protective tissue produced by an underlying cork cambium that surround the vascular tissues. The latter are produced by another cylindrical secondary meristem, the vascular cambium, which produces xylem tissues towards the inside and phloem tissues towards the outside ( Nieminen et al., 2004; Groover and Robischon, 2006 ). The activity of the cambial stem cells drives the radial expansion of roots and stems, a process termed \u2018secondary growth\u2019. Formation of xylem tissues through secondary growth is the main process of durable biomass accumulation in plants and most prominent in tree trunks ( Groover and Robischon, 2006; Spicer and Groover, 2010 ). In Arabidopsis, substantial secondary growth is not only observed at later stages of root development, but also in the hypocotyl, the embryonic stem ( Chaffey et al., 2002; Sibout et al., 2008 ) ( Figure 1A ). Consistent with the hypocotyl\u2019s role as critical junction between the root and shoot systems that limits the reciprocal transfer of edaphic resources and photosynthetic metabolites, its secondary growth occurs throughout most of the Arabidopsis life cycle and in some ways resembles the radial expansion of tree trunks. The hypocotyl initiates secondary growth shortly after seedling establishment, once its cell elongation growth along the main body axis has seized ( Sibout et al., 2008; Ragni et al., 2011 ). Thus, unlike in post-embryonic stems, secondary growth in the hypocotyl is not obscured by parallel elongation growth, making it an ideal model system for this process. 10. 7554/eLife. 01567. 003Figure 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01567. 003 Previous work has identified two principal phases of hypocotyl secondary growth, an early phase of proportional growth, when the cambium produces phloem and xylem tissues at roughly equal rates, and a later phase of xylem expansion, when the relative production of xylem dominates the radial expansion ( Chaffey et al., 2002; Sibout et al., 2008 ). Early phase xylem consists mainly of the interconnected xylem vessels ( terminally differentiated, dead cells with perforated, thick cell walls that are the actual conducts for water and solutes ) and xylem parenchyma cells. Early phase phloem comprises the sieve elements ( interconnected, enucleated but alive cells that perform the actual transport of the phloem sap ), companion cells ( which provide basic metabolism for sieve elements and are responsible for loading and un-loading of phloem sap cargo ) and phloem parenchyma cells. In the xylem expansion phase, both xylem and phloem also start to differentiate fibers ( cells with thick secondary cell walls that provide structural support ), which can be formed from parenchymatic precursor cells. It has been shown that the transition between the early phase and the xylem expansion phase is triggered by the onset of flowering ( Sibout et al., 2008 ), through a mobile shoot-derived signal, the plant hormone gibberellin ( Ragni et al., 2011 ). In these studies, the transition had been defined as a shift in the relative occupancy of overall xylem vs overall phloem tissue in hypocotyl cross sections. However, as only the overall areas of combined xylem and phloem tissues were considered, it remains unclear what the transition represents at the cellular level. Various scenarios could be envisioned, for instance the relative expansion of xylem might be a consequence of increased post-cambial proliferation during xylem differentiation, or of increased cambial stem cell activity toward the xylem side, or the inverse with respect to phloem. To distinguish between these possibilities proved to be very difficult due to the absence of information about the cellular dynamics during the secondary growth process. Moreover, such investigation is severely hampered by the fact that this process is not amenable to live imaging and can only be monitored invasively, through histological cross sections, thereby killing the individual sample under investigation. Thus, a quantitative understanding of the temporal progression of secondary growth can only be acquired by a high-throughput approach that monitors enough cross-sections from distinct hypocotyls of the same age to provide statistically solid data. In conjunction with the large number and morphological diversity of the cells that constitute this tissue, a quantitative understanding of the cell proliferation, differentiation, and patterning events by conventional means, that is simple visual inspection of cross sections, is out of reach. Therefore, we established an automated histology approach to create a cellular resolution atlas that reveals the vascular morphodynamics during hypocotyl secondary growth. Our data reveal substantially different secondary growth dynamics in two genotypes as well as emerging patterns of cell orientation over time and a constantly equidistant production of phloem poles by the cambium.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Our understanding of the living world has been advanced greatly by studies of \u2018model organisms\u2019, such as mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies. Studying these creatures has been crucial to uncovering the genes that control how our bodies develop and grow, and also to discover the genetic basis of diseases such as cancer. Thale cress\u2014or Arabidopsis thaliana to give its formal name\u2014is the model organism of choice for many plant biologists. This tiny weed has been widely studied because it can complete its lifecycle, from seed to seed, in about 6 weeks, and because its relatively small genome simplifies the search for genes that control specific traits. However, as with other much-studied model systems, understanding the changes that underpin the development of some of the more complex tissues in Arabidopsis has been severely hampered by the shear number of cells involved. After it has emerged from the seed, the plant\u2019s first stem will develop from a few dozen cells in width to several thousand cells with highly specialized tissues arranged in a complex pattern of concentric circles. Although this stem thickening process represents a major developmental change in many plants\u2014from Arabidopsis to oak trees\u2014it has been under-researched. This is partly because it involves so many different cells, and also because it can only be observed in thin sections cut out of the plant\u2019s stem. Now Sankar, Nieminen, Ragni et al. have developed a novel approach, termed \u2018automated quantitative histology\u2019, to overcome these problems. This strategy involves \u2018teaching\u2019 a computer to automatically recognize different plant cells and to measure their important features in high-resolution images of tissue sections. The resulting \u2018map\u2019 of the developing stem\u2014which required over 800 hr of computing time to complete\u2014reveals the changes to cells and tissues as they develop that allow the transport of water, sugars and nutrients between the above- and below-ground organs. Sankar, Nieminen, Ragni et al. suggest that their novel approach could, in the future, also be applied to study the development of other tissues and organisms, including animals ."}

However, current re-identification schemes suffer from high latency and limited access. Here, we describe a rapid, inexpensive, and portable strategy to robustly re-identify human DNA called 'MinION sketching'. MinION sketching requires as few as 3 min of sequencing and 60-300 random SNPs to re-identify a sample enabling near real-time applications of DNA re-identification. Our method capitalizes on the rapidly growing availability of genomic reference data for cell lines, tissues in biobanks, and individuals. This empowers the application of MinION sketching in research and clinical settings for periodic cell line and tissue authentication. Importantly, our method enables considerably faster and more robust cell line authentication relative to current practices and could help to minimize the amount of irreproducible research caused by mix-ups and contamination in human cell and tissue cultures.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The human genome represents the complete set of genetic information needed to make a person. DNA sequencing technologies used to study genomes have become much faster, cheaper and more accessible over recent years. This has enabled them to be used more regularly in various fields like precision medicine, in research laboratories and forensics. Even so, there are still fields where optimization is critical. Reproducibility is an important issue in biomedical research; one group of scientists working with human cells may report results that other scientists cannot reproduce. Sometimes this is because the original work was done in the wrong type of cells by mistake. Human cells used in biomedical research are very hard to discriminate from each other using microscopes; however, DNA analysis can be used to ensure the origin of the cells. The MinION device, a USB compatible handheld DNA sequencer, has become available in the last few years. Its size, speed and portability could enable many new uses for DNA sequencing. Technology like this could be used to confirm which cells the scientists are working with before they publish their results. Yet, currently DNA readings from the MinION are not accurate enough to be used to reliably confirm the identity of human cells used in research. Zaaijer et al. have now developed an approach that can accurately identify human cells using the MinION device. The approach involves \u201cDNA re-identification\u201d, which works by comparing an unknown DNA sample to a collection of known DNA profiles. Using their new method, Zaaijer et al. report that, with three minutes of DNA sequencing, they can correctly identify a DNA sample, with 99. 9% confidence. This is a high enough level of accuracy for the system to tell the difference between one person and another, using only their DNA. This new technology is much faster than current rapid DNA sequencing approaches. Previously, processing DNA samples could take hours or even days and was not particularly portable. The new technology has many applications from finding criminals to diagnosing illnesses and tracking epidemics. It is also an affordable way for laboratories to confirm the identity of cells they are working with. This has the potential to save billions in research funding each year and speed up scientific progress ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMany epithelial cancers show cell cycle dysfunction tightly correlated with the overexpression of the serine/threonine kinase Aurora A ( AURKA ). Its role in mitotic progression has been extensively characterised, and evidence for new AURKA functions emerges. Here, we reveal that AURKA is located and imported in mitochondria in several human cancer cell lines. Mitochondrial AURKA impacts on two organelle functions: mitochondrial dynamics and energy production. When AURKA is expressed at endogenous levels during interphase, it induces mitochondrial fragmentation independently from RALA. Conversely, AURKA enhances mitochondrial fusion and ATP production when it is over-expressed. We demonstrate that AURKA directly regulates mitochondrial functions and that AURKA over-expression promotes metabolic reprogramming by increasing mitochondrial interconnectivity. Our work paves the way to anti-cancer therapeutics based on the simultaneous targeting of mitochondrial functions and AURKA inhibition.  The mitotic kinase AURKA controls centrosomal maturation, the timing of mitotic entry, bipolar and central spindle assembly, and cytokinesis ( Nikonova et al., 2013 ). AURKA is over-expressed in epithelial cancers, and it is believed to act as an oncogene through the induction of genomic instability. AURKA alters the number of centrosomes, the properties of the mitotic spindles, it induces aneuploidy and a defective cell division ( Bischoff et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2004; Nikonova et al., 2013 ). To perform these functions, AURKA interacts with multiple proteins at centrosomes and on the mitotic spindle, in a kinase-dependent or independent manner ( Nikonova et al., 2013 ). In mice, the over-expression of AURKA suffices to induce the appearance of mammary tumours similar to human breast cancers ( Wang et al., 2006; Treekitkarnmongkol et al., 2016 ). Thus, AURKA has been of high interest for pharmaceutical companies as a drug target, despite the currently available drugs show only modest beneficial effects in patients. Although still at a preclinical level, the only promising strategy appears to be the combination of AURKA inhibitors with agents simultaneously targeting multiple cancer-relevant AURKA partners and functions ( Nikonova et al., 2013 ). Epithelial cancers were found to be dependent on mitochondrial ATP, produced through oxidative phosphorylation, as a source of energy ( Whitaker-Menezes et al., 2011 ). Particularly, epithelial cancer cells were found to carry a specific molecular signature constituted by 38 genes regulating the functionality of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the synthesis of mitochondrial ribosomes and the import of proteins into mitochondria. It is known that mitochondria adapt their ATP production rate by modulating their morphology from fragmented organelles to an interconnected network ( Mishra and Chan, 2016 ). In particular, mitochondrial fusion was shown to increase ATP production in several paradigms ( Mitra et al., 2009; Tondera et al., 2009 ), granting protection against apoptosis ( Lee et al., 2004 ) and increasing cell proliferation ( Mitra, 2013 ). However, how these effects are established by increasing mitochondrial connectivity remains to be mechanistically elucidated. In mammals, fusion is mediated by the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane GTPases MFN1 and 2 and the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane OPA1, which undergoes a proteolytic cleavage from a long ( L-OPA1 ) to a short ( S-OPA1 ) isoforms. The balance between L- and S-OPA1 is controlled by multiple mitochondrial proteases to ensure mitochondrial fusion both in normal and in stress conditions ( Mishra and Chan, 2016 ). Conversely, mitochondrial fission is regulated by the cytosolic GTPase DNM1L through its interaction with several mitochondrial receptors ( MFF, MIEF1 and 2, FIS1 ), but also through the regulation of its post-translational modifications ( phosphorylation, SUMOylation, acetylation and S-nitrosilation ) ( Mishra and Chan, 2016 ). Mitochondrial fission is also used to separate dysfunctional mitochondria from the healthy network prior to their degradation by mitophagy, a selective type of autophagy ( Youle and Narendra, 2011 ). Given that AURKA is a hallmark of epithelial cancers, understanding the complexity of the AURKA interactome is mandatory to optimise therapeutic strategies in patients with epithelial cancers derived from AURKA over-expression. Despite often considered a mitotic protein, recent evidence showed that AURKA is active at interphase as well ( Mori et al., 2009; Bertolin et al., 2016 ), although its roles beyond mitosis are still largely unexplored. We here show that interphasic AURKA localises to mitochondria, where it is imported and processed. While exploring the potential roles of mitochondrial AURKA, we observed that it increases mitochondrial fusion through a direct interaction with proteins regulating mitochondrial dynamics. The modulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission mechanisms when AURKA is over-expressed increases ATP production via the mitochondrial respiratory chain.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Structures called mitochondria power cells by turning oxygen and sugar into chemical energy. Each cell can have thousands of mitochondria, which work together to supply changing energy demands. They can fuse together or break apart, forming networks that change size and produce different amounts of energy. Getting the balance right is crucial; if energy levels are too low, the cell will not be able to grow and divide. If energy levels are too high, the cell can grow at a faster rate, which can contribute to the cell becoming cancerous. Although we know that mitochondria provide energy, it is not clear how they communicate to fine-tune the supply. Some clues come from cancer cells that seem dependent on their mitochondria for survival. In these cells, levels of a protein called AURKA are higher than normal. AURKA helps cells to divide, and it interacts with many different proteins. This complexity makes it difficult to work out exactly what AURKA does, but it is possible that it plays a role in energy supply. Bertolin et al. have now investigated whether mitochondria use AURKA to communicate inside human breast cancer cells. Tagging AURKA proteins with a fluorescent marker revealed that it accumulates inside mitochondria. Once it gets there, AURKA changes the shape of the mitochondria, which has dramatic effects on their capacity to produce energy. At normal levels, AURKA causes the mitochondria to fragment, breaking apart into smaller pieces. This maintains their energy output at a normal level. If AURKA levels are too high, the mitochondria fuse together and produce more energy. This means AURKA could help to fuel fast-growing cancer cells. Current drugs that aim to treat cancer by blocking the activity of AURKA show poor results. This is partly due to the fact that the protein has so many different roles in the cell. Finding that AURKA affects mitochondria is the first step in understanding one of its unknown roles. It also suggests the possibility of developing new drugs to change how mitochondria make energy in cancer cells that contain high levels of AURKA ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe DNA repair protein RAD52 is an emerging therapeutic target of high importance for BRCA-deficient tumors. Depletion of RAD52 is synthetically lethal with defects in tumor suppressors BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2. RAD52 also participates in the recovery of the stalled replication forks. Anticipating that ssDNA binding activity underlies the RAD52 cellular functions, we carried out a high throughput screening campaign to identify compounds that disrupt the RAD52-ssDNA interaction. Lead compounds were confirmed as RAD52 inhibitors in biochemical assays. Computational analysis predicted that these inhibitors bind within the ssDNA-binding groove of the RAD52 oligomeric ring. The nature of the inhibitor-RAD52 complex was validated through an in silico screening campaign, culminating in the discovery of an additional RAD52 inhibitor. Cellular studies with our inhibitors showed that the RAD52-ssDNA interaction enables its function at stalled replication forks, and that the inhibition of RAD52-ssDNA binding acts additively with BRCA2 or MUS81 depletion in cell killing.  Understanding of synthetically lethal relationships between genome caretakers will help to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of genomic integrity and may lead to the advancement of personalized cancer treatments. Depletion of the human DNA repair protein RAD52 is synthetically lethal with defects in tumor suppressors, BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 ( Feng et al., 2011; Lok et al., 2012; Cramer-Morales et al., 2013 ). Importantly, this synthetic lethality requires both copies of the tumor suppressor gene to be defective and should not manifest in the heterozygous cells. Therefore, specific RAD52 inhibitors are expected to selectively kill cancerous cells lacking one of these three tumor suppressors. Replacing or supplementing standard radiation and chemotherapies with the RAD52 inhibitors will help to decrease the toxicity associated with these treatments. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressors that are commonly mutated or depleted in hereditary and sporadic breast cancers, and have important roles in homologous recombination ( HR ) ( Prakash et al., 2015 ), a template directed pathway that accurately repairs DNA lesions affecting both strands of the DNA duplex ( Couedel et al., 2004; Moynahan and Jasin, 2010; Jasin and Rothstein, 2013; Kowalczykowski, 2015; Heyer, 2015 ). BRCA1 regulates repair pathway choice after DNA damage by promoting HR ( Kass and Jasin, 2010; Prakash et al., 2015 ). BRCA2 is a recombination mediator, which facilitates assembly of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA downstream of BRCA1 activities ( Couedel et al., 2004; Jensen et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Thorslund et al., 2010; Prakash et al., 2015 ). PALB2 mediates interactions between BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins, acts as a scaffold connecting numerous tumor suppressors ( Park et al., 2014 ), stimulates Pol\u03b7-dependent DNA synthesis ( Buisson et al., 2014 ) and RAD51 recombinase activity ( Dray et al., 2010 ). Finally, the three tumor suppressors cooperate with Fanconi Anemia proteins in the repair of inter-strand DNA cross-links ( Kim and D'Andrea, 2012 ). Rad52 was identified in yeast as the main recombination mediator and the central player in the single-strand annealing pathway of mutagenic homology-directed DNA repair ( Mortensen et al., 2009 ). In contrast to the severe recombination and repair phenotypes observed in yeast, deletion of RAD52 has only a mild effect on recombination in vertebrates ( Rijkers et al., 1998; Yamaguchi-Iwai et al., 1998; Yanez and Porter, 2002 ). Although it is clear that RAD52 is important for survival and uncontrolled proliferation of BRCA-deficient cancer cells, the molecular mechanism by which RAD52 allows BRCA-deficient cells to survive is unknown. The proposed mechanisms included the putative RAD52 recombination mediator function and its role in single-strand annealing pathway of homology-directed DSB repair ( Lok and Powell, 2012 ). Functional interactions between BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD52, as well as the ability of RAD52 to promote BRCA-independent cell survival, are commonly expected to involve HR-related mechanisms. The recent discovery that BRCA proteins act together with the Fanconi Anemia pathway to support and protect replication forks points to a potentially more complex scenario ( Schlacher et al., 2011; 2012 ). Additionally, RAD52 cooperates with the structure-selective nuclease MUS81/EME1 to generate DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) essential for the recovery of stalled replication forks in the absence of the replication check point ( Murfuni et al., 2013 ). Known biochemical functions of human RAD52 include annealing of two complementary ssDNA strands in the presence of replication protein A ( RPA ) ( Van Dyck et al., 2001; Grimme et al., 2010 ) and the ability to pair ssDNA to complementary homologous regions in supercoiled DNA ( Kagawa et al., 2001; Murfuni et al., 2013 ). Putative recombination mediator activity of RAD52 ( Benson et al., 1998 ) should also require ssDNA binding. Therefore, if the cellular functions of the RAD52 protein depend on the ssDNA binding, then inhibition of the RAD52-ssDNA interaction should have similar consequences as RAD52 depletion. RAD52 forms an oligomeric ring ( Kagawa et al., 2002; Lloyd et al., 2002; Singleton et al., 2002; Stasiak et al., 2000 ), where the primary ssDNA binding site is located in the narrow groove spanning the ring circumference ( Lloyd et al., 2005; Mortensen et al., 2002 ). We designated this ssDNA-binding groove as the feature to be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. While disrupting the protein-ssDNA interaction with small molecules presents a formidable challenge ( Yap et al., 2012 ) that has only been overcome in a handful of cases, the ssDNA binding groove of RAD52 ( for reasons discussed below ) is a promising target and is distinct from the ssDNA binding sites of other ssDNA binding proteins. Here, we report the\u00a0development of a novel FRET-based high throughput screening ( HTS ) assay that led to the identification of compounds that disrupt the RAD52-ssDNA interaction. Initial HTS hits were biochemically validated in RAD52 functional assays and tested in two separate cellular assays. Two available high resolution crystal structures ( PDB: 1H2I and 1KNO ) of the conserved ssDNA-binding domain of RAD52 highlight the unique nature of this target ( Singleton et al., 2002; Kagawa et al., 2002 ). The ssDNA-binding region is continuous around the circumference of the ring and has shallow sub-pockets that are repeating in each monomer. While the truncated version of RAD52 in the crystal structures may differ from the full length RAD52, it likely recapitulates the structural features of the ssDNA-binding groove. Computational docking followed by all\u00a0atom-simulated annealing placed all identified RAD52 inhibitors into two distinct sub-pockets within the ssDNA-binding groove. Compounds \u20181\u2019 ( ( \u2212 ) \u2212Epigallocatechin ) and \u20186\u2019 ( Epigallocatechin-3-monogallate ) predicted to bind within the RAD52 ssDNA-binding site, inhibited the\u00a0formation of the RAD52-dependent DSBs in hydroxyurea ( HU ) -stressed, checkpoint deficient cells to the same level as RAD52 depletion. Moreover, \u20181\u2019 acts additively with the MUS81 depletion to kill cells treated with hydroxyurea ( HU ), which perturbs replication, and with checkpoint inhibitor UCN01. These data strongly suggest that the ssDNA binding activity of RAD52 is required for recovery of stalled replication forks in checkpoint deficient cells. We also show that \u20181\u2019 selectively kills cells depleted of BRCA2, further supporting the importance of the RAD52-ssDNA interaction in BRCA deficient cells and the potential therapeutic value of RAD52 inhibition. Finally, in order to validate the strength of our hypotheses about the structural nature of the RAD52-inhibitor complex, we developed a validated in silico screening campaign, based on our HTS results, using a library of four thousand natural products. We describe the discovery of NP-004255, a macrocyclic compound, which we show by NMR WaterLOGSY and biophysical assays to be a completely novel and effective inhibitor of the RAD52-ssDNA interaction. The implication of these findings for the discovery of novel therapeutics that specifically inhibit the activity of RAD52 is discussed.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells are constantly in danger of losing or scrambling critical genetic information because of DNA damage. To cope with this stress, cells have numerous DNA repair systems. One of these systems \u2013 homology-directed DNA repair \u2013 involves the proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are often missing or defective in breast and ovarian cancers. The BRCA-deficient cancer cells can still survive, but become \u201caddicted\u201d to other DNA repair proteins \u2013 among them a protein called RAD52. It might be possible to kill these cancer cells using drugs that stop RAD52 from working. Such treatments would have the benefit of not harming normal healthy cells, as these cells contain working BRCA proteins and can survive without RAD52. It is not currently known exactly how RAD52 allows the BRCA-deficient cells to survive, but this probably depends on RAD52\u2019s ability to bind to single strands of DNA. Small molecules that block the interaction between the RAD52 protein and DNA might therefore help to kill cancer cells. Hengel et al. developed a high throughput biophysical method to search through a large collection of small molecules to find those that prevent RAD52 from binding to DNA. The best potential drug leads were then tested in laboratory-grown human cells and using biophysical and biochemical techniques. Computational approaches were also used to model how these molecules block the interaction between RAD52 and DNA at the atomistic level. Hengel et al. then used the information about how the small molecules bind to RAD52 to perform further computational screening. This identified a natural compound that competes with single-stranded DNA to bind to RAD52. The activity of this molecule was then validated using biophysical methods. The methods used by Hengel et al. provide the foundation for further searches for new anticancer drugs. Future studies that employ the small molecule drugs identified so far will also help to determine exactly how RAD52 works in human cells and how it helps cancer cells to survive ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe diversity of cutaneous sensory afferents has been studied by many investigators using behavioral, physiologic, molecular, and genetic approaches. Largely missing, thus far, is an analysis of the complete morphologies of individual afferent arbors. Here we present a survey of cutaneous sensory arbor morphologies in hairy skin of the mouse using genetically-directed sparse labeling with a sensory neuron-specific alkaline phosphatase reporter. Quantitative analyses of 719 arbors, among which 77 were fully reconstructed, reveal 10 morphologically distinct types. Among the two types with the largest arbors, one contacts \u223c200 hair follicles with circumferential endings and a second is characterized by a densely ramifying arbor with one to several thousand branches and a total axon length between one-half and one meter. These observations constrain models of receptive field size and structure among cutaneous sensory neurons, and they raise intriguing questions regarding the cellular and developmental mechanisms responsible for this morphological diversity.  The skin is the largest organ that senses external stimuli, and the responses of sensory afferents in the skin encompass a diversity of modalities richer than those any other sensory organ. Among these modalities are thermosensation, pain, itch, and many distinct types of mechanosensation. A further level of complexity arises from the distinctive anatomic distributions of the different types of cutaneous sensory afferents. For example, hairy skin has specialized mechanosensors that contact hair follicles and their associated Merkel cell clusters, whereas glabrous ( i. e. palmar ) skin is innervated by specialized mechanosensors, such as those that contact Meissner corpuscles, that are absent from hairy skin. Additionally, the spatial density of sensory afferents and the spatial scale of sensory integration vary widely over the body surface. For example, two-point discrimination for mechanical stimuli has high resolution on the fingertips and low resolution on the torso ( Iggo, 1982 ), and sensory thresholds for hot and cold stimuli vary in a fine-grained mosaic over the body surface ( Norrsell et al., 1999 ). Early physiologic insights into cutaneous afferent diversity came from the discovery that different types of receptors are associated with distinct conduction velocities and pharmacologic thresholds for conduction block ( Erlanger et al., 1924; Gasser and Erlanger, 1927, 1929 ). Recordings from peripheral nerves also revealed differences in stimulus threshold and in adaptation to sustained stimuli, especially among different subtypes of mechanoreceptors ( Iggo, 1982 ). Structural insights have come from light and electron microscopic studies that have defined numerous specialized nerve endings and their associated structures and correlated them with different cutaneous sensory modalities. These structures include free endings, Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles, Raffini endings, Kraus end bulbs, Merkel cell clusters, and lanceolate and circumferential endings associated with hair follicles ( Iggo and Andres, 1982 ). Over the past 15 years the diversity of cutaneous receptor subtypes has been placed on a foundation that is increasingly defined in molecular terms. The identification of receptor proteins\u2014such as TRP channels for pain and temperature, Mrg receptors for itch, and various receptors for inflammatory compounds\u2014and their localization to subsets of DRG neurons has provided the most direct molecular classification of sensory neurons ( Basbaum et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009 ). Cutaneous receptor subtypes also express distinctive sets of transcription factors, neuropeptides, neurotrophin receptors, and miscellaneous cytosolic proteins, which can be used in combination to provide an empirical classification ( Fundin et al., 1997; Marmig\u00e8re and Ernfors, 2007; Reed-Geaghan and Maricich, 2011 ). Largely missing thus far from the field of cutaneous sensory biology is an analysis of the full morphologies of sensory afferents. While the cross-sectional microanatomy of cutaneous sensory afferents has been intensively studied, their full arbors have been technically difficult to visualize for two reasons. First, the analysis of complete arbor morphologies requires either single cell tracer filling or genetically-directed sparse expression of a reporter, followed by imaging of full thickness skin to visualize individual labeled arbors against a background in which the vast majority of arbors are unlabeled. With respect to tracer filling methods, since cutaneous arbors generally reside at a substantial distance from their cell bodies in the DRG, tracer diffusion from the cell body is inefficient. Second, because skin is a relatively refractile tissue, immunostaining and imaging of full-thickness skin preparations has not been widely practiced. This second challenge has largely been solved with the recent development of protocols that give high signal-to-noise ratio immunostaining and organic solvents that render intact skin optically clear ( Li et al., 2011 ). In contrast to the challenges associated with visualizing sensory projections in the skin, a number of investigators have analyzed the projections of individual dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons in the dorsal laminae of the spinal cord and have correlated these projection patterns with molecular and physiologic properties ( e. g. Woodbury et al., 2001 ). Defining the full morphologies of cutaneous sensory afferents is of interest for many reasons. Most obviously, it would inform our understanding of receptive field size and structure. It could also reveal patterns of target innervation and territoriality that could be used to classify sensory neurons and complement classifications based on physiologic and molecular criteria ( Marmig\u00e8re and Ernfors, 2007; Reed-Geaghan and Maricich, 2011 ). In other systems, such as the vertebrate retina, the integration of morphologic and physiologic information has provided deep insights into structure, function, and evolution ( Rodieck and Brening, 1983; Masland, 2001, 2011 ). In the present study, we have used genetically-directed sparse labeling in adult mouse back skin to survey many hundreds of cutaneous afferent arbors and to generate a collection of complete arbor morphologies. Quantitative parametric analysis reveals 10 discrete classes within this collection, several of which have arbors of extraordinary length and complexity.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Sensory neurons carry information from sensory cells in the eyes, ears and other sensory organs to the brain and spinal cord so that they can coordinate the body's response to its environment and various stimuli. The sensory organs responsible for four of the traditional senses\u2014vision, hearing, smell and taste\u2014are relatively small and self-contained: however, the sensory organ responsible for touch is as big as the body itself. Moreover, a variety of many different types of sensory cells in the skin allow the body to respond to temperature, pain, itches and a range of other external stimuli. Despite more than a century of research, relatively little is known about the morphology of the complex networks ( arbors ) of sensory neurons that send signals towards the central nervous system. This is mainly due to difficulties involved in imaging intact skin, the way that different arbors overlap and intermingle, and the relatively large distances that separate the bodies of neuronal cells and the farthest reaches of their arbors. Wu et al. employed an imaging method that exploits the Cre-Lox system that is already widely used in genetics. In this approach a Cre enzyme is used to remove a region of DNA that is flanked by two genetically engineered Lox sequences. Wu et al. used a gene that codes for an enzyme marker ( alkaline phosphatase ) that previous investigators had into the DNA of mice. The gene was inserted in such a way that it was only expressed in sensory neurons that innervate the skin when Cre-Lox recombination had removed an adjacent segment of DNA. Moreover, Wu et al. used this reporter gene in combination with a modified Cre enzyme that only enters the nuclei of cells in the presence of a drug ( Tamoxifen ), so the probability that the marker gene is expressed is determined by the concentration of Tamoxifen. By administering a low level of Tamoxifen to pregnant mice, it was possible to label a very small number of sensory neurons in each embryo. Individual neurons that express the alkaline phosphatase marker were visualized with a histochemical reaction that rendered them dark purple. The remainder of the tissue remained unstained. Based on quantitative analyses of the morphologies of more than 700 arbors, Wu et al. identified 10 distinct types of neurons. Of the two types of neurons with the largest arbors, one makes contact with \u223c200 hair follicles, with the nerve endings completely encircling the follicles; the other type of arbor contains several thousand branches, with a total length for all of the branches summing to as much as one meter in length. The next challenge is to study the morphologies of neurons in tissues other than the skin, and also the neurons involved in other sensory systems, and to explore the cellular and developmental mechanisms responsible for the morphological diversity found in these initial experiments ."}

We propose a new concept by which tumor progression can be suppressed by manipulating tumor cell identity. In this study, we examined the effect of ER stress on apoptosis resistant tumorous cells in a Caenorhabditis elegans germline tumor model. We discovered that ER stress suppressed the progression of the lethal germline tumor by activating the ER stress sensor IRE-1. This suppression was associated with the induction of germ cell transdifferentiation into ectopic somatic cells. Strikingly, transdifferentiation of the tumorous germ cells restored their ability to execute apoptosis and enabled their subsequent removal from the gonad. Our results indicate that tumor cell transdifferentiation has the potential to combat cancer and overcome the escape of tumor cells from the cell death machinery.  A major challenge in the tumor therapy field is the development of new strategies to eliminate tumors and cancer cells. Whereas most of the current therapeutic strategies are based on apoptosis induction in the tumor cells, the effectiveness of these approaches is limited due to acquired apoptosis resistance ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000, 2011 ). Thus, deciphering ways to restore apoptosis sensitivity to tumorous cells that acquired apoptosis resistance may revive \u2018old\u2019 tools with therapeutic potential to eliminate tumor cells. The gld-1 ( GermLine Development defective ) gene encodes a germline-specific QUAKING-like RNA binding protein, which represses the translation of a variety of germline transcripts ( Jungkamp et al., 2011; Wright et al., 2011 ). Consequently, GLD-1 regulates many aspects of germ cell biology ( Francis et al., 1995a, 1995b; Kadyk and Kimble, 1998; Jan et al., 1999; Hansen et al., 2004; Ciosk et al., 2006 ). One of the striking consequence of a deficiency in gld-1 is the formation of a proximal germline tumor that fills the gonad ( Francis et al., 1995a ). This germline tumor is the result of re-entry of meiotic germ cells into the mitotic cell cycle instead of maturing into oocytes ( Francis et al., 1995a ). Importantly, some aspects of tumorigenesis are exhibited in the gld-1 germline tumor model. These include the ability of the tumorous germ cells to proliferate in a growth factor\u2013independent manner ( Francis et al., 1995a ) and their regulation by genes homologous to known human oncogenes or human tumor suppressor genes ( Pinkston-Gosse and Kenyon, 2007 ). Notably, these tumorous germ cells acquired resistance to apoptosis ( Gumienny et al., 1999 ). In addition, some precocious germ cell transdifferentiation into ectopic somatic cells has been reported to occur at a low frequency in gld-1-deficient animal ( Ciosk et al., 2006 ). This transdifferentiation of the germ cells can be further enhanced by manipulation of RNA binding proteins, P granule components, transcription factors and histone modifiers; all of which regulate gene expression within the transdifferentiating germ cells themselves ( Ciosk et al., 2006; Tursun et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2012; Updike et al., 2014 ). In this study, we investigated whether cellular and organismal stress can affect germ cell fate and tumorigenicity in the gld-1 tumor model.

However, cancer cells can often tolerate much greater damage than normal cells. Toxic chemotherapies, which are often used to treat cancer, work by severely damaging the cells to help trigger their self-destruction. Unfortunately, chemotherapy does not work on all cancer cells, and the remaining treatment-resistant cells may continue to grow and spread in more aggressive ways. Now, Levi-Ferber et al. have found a way to change the identity of cancer cells, which makes them more likely to self-destruct. The experiments used roundworms called Caenorhabditis elegans that had a genetic mutation that causes them to develop tumors in their reproductive organs. Normally, the cells in these tumors do not self-destruct. Levi-Ferber et al. exposed tumor cells from the worms to chemicals or to genetic modifications that cause unfolded proteins to accumulate inside the cell. This build-up of proteins stresses a structure in the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. Normally, if endoplasmic reticulum stress gets too high, the cell activates various pathways to relieve the stress, and if these fail, the cell self-destructs. Levi-Ferber et al. showed that a protein called IRE-1, which senses endoplasmic reticulum stress, caused the tumor cells to change into a type of non-cancerous cell. After the change, the cells were also more sensitive to self-destruction. This meant that tumors grew more slowly and ended up smaller, allowing the animals to survive longer. Together, the experiments suggest that treatments that force cancer cells to become a different cell type might be one way to prevent the emergence of treatment-resistant tumor cells. Future research will be needed to investigate exactly how IRE-1 causes the identity of the cell to change, and to see if this process could treat other kinds of cancer ."}

Whipple\u2019s disease ( WD ) strikes only a small minority of individuals infected with Tw ( <0. 01% ), whereas asymptomatic chronic carriage is more common ( <25% ). We studied a multiplex kindred, containing four WD patients and five healthy Tw chronic carriers. We hypothesized that WD displays autosomal dominant ( AD ) inheritance, with age-dependent incomplete penetrance. We identified a single very rare non-synonymous mutation in the four patients: the private R98W variant of IRF4, a transcription factor involved in immunity. The five Tw carriers were younger, and also heterozygous for R98W. We found that R98W was loss-of-function, modified the transcriptome of heterozygous leukocytes following Tw stimulation, and was not dominant-negative. We also found that only six of the other 153 known non-synonymous IRF4 variants were loss-of-function. Finally, we found that IRF4 had evolved under purifying selection. AD IRF4 deficiency can underlie WD by haploinsufficiency, with age-dependent incomplete penetrance.  Whipple\u2019s disease ( WD ) was first described as an intestinal inflammatory disease by George H. Whipple in 1907 ( Whipple, 1907 ). Its infectious origin was suspected in 1961 ( Yardley and Hendrix, 1961 ), and the causal microbe, Tropheryma whipplei ( Tw ), a Gram-positive actinomycete, was detected by PCR in 1992 ( Relman et al., 1992 ), and cultured in 2000 ( Raoult et al., 2000 ). Tw is probably transmitted between humans via the oro-oral or feco-oral routes. WD is a chronic condition with a late onset ( mean age at onset: 55 years ) ( Braubach et al., 2017 ) affecting multiple organs. The clinical manifestations of classical WD are arthralgia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss ( Dobbins, 1987; Durand et al., 1997; Fleming et al., 1988; Mahnel et al., 2005; Maizel et al., 1970 ). However, about 25% of WD patients display no gastrointestinal or osteoarticular symptoms, instead presenting with cardiac and/or neurological manifestations ( Durand et al., 1997; Fenollar et al., 2014, Fenollar et al., 2001; Gubler et al., 1999; Schneider et al., 2008 ). WD is fatal if left untreated, and relapses occur in 2% to 33% of treated cases, even after prolonged appropriate antibiotic treatment ( Lagier et al., 2011; Marumganti and Murphy, 2008 ). WD is rare and has been estimated to affect about one in a million individuals ( Dobbins, 1981, 1987; Fenollar et al., 2007 ). However, about two thousand cases have been reported in at least nine countries worldwide, mostly in North America and Western Europe ( Bakkali et al., 2008; Desnues et al., 2010; Fenollar et al., 2008a; Lagier et al., 2010; Pu\u00e9chal, 2016; Schneider et al., 2008 ). Chronic asymptomatic carriage of Tw is common in the general population, and this bacterium has been detected in feces, saliva, and intestinal mucosae. The prevalence of Tw carriage in the feces has been estimated at 2% to 11% for the general population, but can reach 26% in sewer workers and 37% in relatives of patients and carriers ( Amsler et al., 2003; Ehrbar et al., 1999; Fenollar et al., 2014, Fenollar et al., 2007; Maibach et al., 2002; Rolain et al., 2007; Schneider et al., 2008; Street et al., 1999 ). Seroprevalence for specific antibodies against Tw in the general population varies from 50% in France to 70% in Senegal ( Fenollar et al., 2009, Fenollar et al., 2014; Raoult et al., 2000; Schneider et al., 2008 ). At least 75% of infected individuals clear Tw primary infections, but a minority ( <25% ) become asymptomatic carriers, a very small proportion of whom develop WD ( <0. 01% ) ( Fenollar et al., 2008b ). Tw infection is therefore, necessary but not sufficient, for WD development, and it is unclear whether prolonged asymptomatic carriage necessarily precedes WD. The hypothesis that WD results from the emergence of a more pathogenic clonal strain of Tw was not supported by bacterial genotyping ( Li et al., 2008 ). WD mostly affects individuals of European origin, but does not seem to be favored by specific environments. WD is typically sporadic, but six multiplex kindreds have been reported, with cases often diagnosed years apart, suggesting a possible genetic component ( Durand et al., 1997; Fenollar et al., 2007; Ponz de Leon et al., 2006 ). WD patients are not prone to other severe infections ( Marth et al., 2016 ). Moreover, WD has never been reported in patients with conventional primary immunodeficiencies ( PIDs ) ( Picard et al., 2018 ). This situation is reminiscent of other sporadic severe infections, such as herpes simplex virus-1 encephalitis, severe influenza, recurrent rhinovirus infection, severe varicella zoster disease, trypanosomiasis, invasive staphylococcal disease, and viral infections of the brainstem, which are caused by single-gene inborn errors of immunity in some patients ( Andersen et al., 2015; Casanova, 2015a, Casanova, 2015b; Ciancanelli et al., 2015; Israel et al., 2017; Lamborn et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015; Ogunjimi et al., 2017; Vanhollebeke et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2018 ). We therefore hypothesized that WD might be due to monogenic inborn errors of immunity to Tw, with age-dependent incomplete penetrance.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: In 1907, George Hoyt Whipple \u2013 an American pathologist working at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore \u2013 described a new inflammatory disease that affects the intestine. Patients with this condition, now known as Whipple\u2019s disease, experience diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal and joint pain. The disease is rare; it affects about one in a million people, mostly those over the age of 50 who are of European descent. Later it was discovered that bacteria called Tropheryma whipplei cause Whipple\u2019s disease and that antibiotics can cure it. These bacteria are widespread and yet only a small minority of individuals infected with T. whipplei goes on to develop Whipple\u2019s disease. In some populations, over 50% of individuals have been infected with the bacteria at some point in their lives, but most will get rid of the infection. This raised the question: when exposed to the same microbe, why do some individuals develop a severe disease, while others remain unharmed ? From the 1950s onwards, scientists identified a few families with multiple members who have developed Whipple\u2019s disease. These observations suggested that human genes may play a role in determining whether a person infected with T. whipplei becomes ill. Rare genetic mutations that affect the immune system have also been linked to the development of life-threatening cases of influenza or tuberculosis. Now, Gu\u00e9rin et al. report that, in one French family, an extremely rare mutation in the gene that codes for a protein called IRF4 may contribute to the development of Whipple\u2019s disease. This family had four members with Whipple\u2019s disease, all of whom had one copy of the gene with this rare mutation and one normal copy of the gene. The IRF4 protein acts like a switch that turns on and off some genes involved in the body\u2019s response to infection. In patients with this mutation, the IRF4 protein does not work as it should. Gu\u00e9rin et al. suggest that Whipple\u2019s disease may be caused by specific genetic mutations affecting the immune system in subjects infected by T. whipplei. More studies are needed to see if other genetic mutations also contribute to other cases of Whipple\u2019s disease. Such studies may help physicians to better understand why some people become sick after T. whipplei infections while others do not. They may also help physicians to diagnose the disease, and even lead to better treatments ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe outer membrane ( OM ) of Gram-negative bacteria serves as a selective permeability barrier that allows entry of essential nutrients while excluding toxic compounds, including antibiotics. The OM is asymmetric and contains an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) or lipooligosaccharides ( LOS ) and an inner leaflet of glycerophospholipids ( GPL ). We screened Acinetobacter baumannii transposon mutants and identified a number of mutants with OM defects, including an ABC transporter system homologous to the Mla system in E. coli. We further show that this opportunistic, antibiotic-resistant pathogen uses this multicomponent protein complex and ATP hydrolysis at the inner membrane to promote GPL export to the OM. The broad conservation of the Mla system in Gram-negative bacteria suggests the system may play a conserved role in OM biogenesis. The importance of the Mla system to Acinetobacter baumannii OM integrity and antibiotic sensitivity suggests that its components may serve as new antimicrobial therapeutic targets.  Gram-negative bacteria are enveloped by two lipid bilayers, separated by an aqueous periplasmic space containing a peptidoglycan cell wall. The inner membrane ( IM ) is a symmetric bilayer of glycerophospholipids ( GPL ), of which zwitterionic phosphatidylethanalomine ( PE ), acidic phosphatidylglycerol ( PG ), and cardiolipin ( CL ) are among the most widely distributed in bacteria ( Zhang and Rock, 2008 ). In contrast, the outer membrane ( OM ) is largely asymmetric and composed of an inner leaflet of GPL and an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or lipooligosaccharide ( LOS ) ( Pelletier et al., 2013 ). The OM forms the first line of defense against antimicrobials by functioning as a molecular permeability barrier. The asymmetric nature of its lipid bilayer and the structure of LPS/LOS molecules facilitates barrier function, as the core region of LPS impedes the entry of hydrophobic molecules into the cell while the acyl chains within the bilayer also help to prevent the entry of many hydrophilic compounds ( Bishop, 2014 ). Although progress has been made in understanding many aspects of OM assembly \u2013 including the discovery of an LPS transport system and the machinery for proper folding and insertion of outer membrane proteins ( Okuda and Tokuda, 2011; Okuda et al., 2016 ) \u2013 little is known about the molecular mechanisms for transport of the GPLs necessary for OM formation and barrier function. Acinetobacter baumannii is an important cause of antibiotic-resistant opportunistic infections and has significant innate resistance to disinfectants and antibiotics. Similar to other Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp., individuals with breached skin or damaged respiratory tract mucosa are most vulnerable ( Chmelnitsky et al., 2013; Abbo et al., 2005 ). We performed a genetic screen to identify genes important for the OM barrier of A. baumannii. This led to the identification of an ABC ( ATP-binding cassette ) transporter complex that promotes GPL export to the OM. Transporter disruption attenuates bacterial OM barrier function, resulting in increased susceptibility of A. baumannii to a wide variety of antibiotics. The homologous system for E. coli has previously been termed Mla for its suggested role in the maintenance of outer membrane lipid asymmetry via the removal of GPL from the outer leaflet of the OM to the IM. While this is a reasonable hypothesis, there is not direct biochemical evidence that the Mla system functions to return GPL from the OM to the IM. In this work, we present evidence that the A. baumannii Mla system functions to promote GPL movement from the IM to the OM. This conclusion is based on the observation that newly synthesized GPLs accumulate at the IM of mla mutants, akin to how LPS molecules accumulate at the inner membrane in bacteria with mutations in the lpt genes encoding the LPS ABC transport system ( Okuda et al., 2016 ). Given the broad conservation of Mla in prokaryotic diderm organisms, the anterograde trafficking function of Mla might be exploited by a variety of species.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Gram-negative bacteria are a large group of single-celled organisms that share a typical external envelope. This casing is formed of an inner and an outer membrane, which have different structures and properties. The outer membrane lets nutrients penetrate inside the cell, but blocks out other compounds, such as antibiotics. It is made of a complex assembly of molecules, including glycerolphospholipids ( GPL ) that are produced inside the cells. Very little is known about how this external shield is created and maintained. For example, it was still unclear how GPLs were exported through the inner membrane to the outer one. To investigate these questions, Kamischke et al. exposed a species of Gram-negative bacteria to a molecule that is normally blocked by the outer membrane. If the outer membrane is not working properly, the compound can cross it and the cell turns blue. Kamischke et al. then introduced genetic changes at random locations in the genomes of the bacteria. If colonies became blue, this meant that the mutations had happened in a gene essential for the outer membrane. Sequencing these blue bacteria revealed 58 genes involved in keeping the outer membrane working properly. Amongst them, four genes coded for a transport machine, the Mla system, which allowed GPLs to cross the inner membrane and reach the outer membrane. The experiments also showed that a working Mla system was required for bacteria to survive antibiotics. Certain dangerous Gram-negative bacteria are now resistant to many drugs, having evolved unique envelopes that keep antibiotics at bay. By learning more about the outer membrane, we may be able to create new treatments to bypass or to disable this shield, for example by targeting the Mla system ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nCentrioles are cylindrical cell organelles with a ninefold symmetric peripheral microtubule array that is essential to template cilia and flagella. They are built around a central cartwheel assembly that is organized through homo-oligomerization of the centriolar protein SAS-6, but whether SAS-6 self-assembly can dictate cartwheel and thereby centriole symmetry is unclear. Here we show that Leishmania major SAS-6 crystallizes as a 9-fold symmetric cartwheel and provide the X-ray structure of this assembly at a resolution of 3. 5 \u00c5. We furthermore demonstrate that oligomerization of Leishmania SAS-6 can be inhibited by a small molecule in vitro and provide indications for its binding site. Our results firmly establish that SAS-6 can impose cartwheel symmetry on its own and indicate how this process might occur mechanistically in vivo. Importantly, our data also provide a proof-of-principle that inhibition of SAS-6 oligomerization by small molecules is feasible.  Eukaryotic flagella and cilia have essential roles in cell locomotion, fluid movement, and sensing. Their formation strictly requires the presence of centrioles, cylindrical organelles with a radially ninefold symmetric, peripheral microtubule array ( Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007; Azimzadeh and Marshall, 2010; Gonczy, 2012 ). During ciliogenesis/flagellogenesis, centrioles ( then referred to as basal bodies ) dock to the cell membrane via their distal ends and nucleate the flagellar/ciliar axoneme from their microtubule array ( Sherwin and Gull, 1989; Dawe et al., 2007; Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011; Avasthi and Marshall, 2012; Chemes, 2012 ). The symmetry and diameter of centrioles ( and thereby of flagella/cilia ) is, to a large extent, established through scaffolding by the centriolar cartwheel, a structure with a central ring-like hub and nine radially projecting spokes that contact the peripheral centriolar microtubules ( Azimzadeh and Marshall, 2010; Brito et al., 2012; Gonczy, 2012 ). The cartwheel is organized through the homo-oligomerization of the highly conserved centriolar protein SAS-6 ( Nakazawa et al., 2007; Kitagawa et al., 2011; van Breugel et al., 2011 ). High-resolution crystal structures of zebrafish and C. reinhardtii SAS-6 fragments together with biochemical and biophysical characterizations ( Kitagawa et al., 2011; van Breugel et al., 2011 ) demonstrated that two dimerization interfaces in SAS-6 mediate this oligomerization: a coiled-coil domain that forms a rod-like parallel dimer; and a globular N-terminal domain that forms a curved head-to-head dimer. Modeling these two dimer interactions together in silico resulted in ring assemblies that were compatible with the symmetry and dimension of cartwheels observed in vivo. In these models, the N-terminal head domains constitute the cartwheel hubs from which the coiled-coil rods project to form the cartwheel spokes ( Kitagawa et al., 2011; van Breugel et al., 2011 ). However, so far, no high-resolution structure of the SAS-6 cartwheel is available. Although rotary shadowing EM studies suggested that SAS-6 might be able to form cartwheels, the available resolution was insufficient to determine the symmetry of the observed assemblies directly ( Kitagawa et al., 2011 ). Another, higher resolution, EM study with recombinant SAS-6 revealed cartwheel-like assemblies with an eightfold, not a ninefold symmetry ( van Breugel et al., 2011 ), while a third EM study showed the presence of SAS-6 tetramers ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, the available biochemical and biophysical data do not provide evidence for efficient cartwheel formation by SAS-6 in solution ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2010; Kitagawa et al., 2011; van Breugel et al., 2011 ), raising the question of whether SAS-6 alone is sufficient to organize ninefold symmetric cartwheels and, if so, under what conditions. SAS-6 is a highly conserved protein that is found in all eukaryotes that have cilia/flagella during some of their life-cycle stages ( Carvalho-Santos et al., 2010; Hodges et al., 2010 ). Inhibiting SAS-6 self-assembly by point mutations in vivo abolishes the formation of centrioles ( Kitagawa et al., 2011; van Breugel et al., 2011; Lettman et al., 2013 ) and thereby flagella ( van Breugel et al., 2011 ). Thus, targeting SAS-6 oligomerization by inhibitors could be a strategy to disable flagellogenesis in organisms that cause human disease and rely on flagella for their pathogenicity. The Trypanosomatids are of special interest in this respect. They consist of parasitic, eukaryotic protozoa with a single flagellum and comprise members that cause major human diseases, such as sleeping sickness ( Trypanosoma brucei ), Chagas disease ( Trypanosoma cruzi ), and Leishmaniasis ( Leishmania spec. ) ( Simpson et al., 2006 ). These organisms display complex life cycles in which they shuttle between an insect vector and human or animal hosts. Their flagellum provides key roles in this life cycle through its multiple functions in essential cellular processes such as motility, signalling, sensing, and attachment ( Vaughan and Gull, 2003; Ralston et al., 2009; Gluenz et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, the flagellar pocket, a membrane invagination from which the flagellum emerges, is the exclusive site of vesicular membrane traffic in these organisms ( Overath et al., 1997; Landfear and Ignatushchenko, 2001; Field and Carrington, 2004, 2009; Overath and Engstler, 2004 ). It is therefore not surprising that flagella have been demonstrated or are proposed to be key factors in the pathogenicity of these organisms ( Vaughan and Gull, 2003; Ralston et al., 2009; Gluenz et al., 2010 ). As in other eukaryotes, the flagellum of the Trypanosomatids is templated from centrioles ( basal bodies ). Tomographic EM studies demonstrated the presence of canonical, ninefold symmetric cartwheel structures in the centre of their centrioles ( Lacomble et al., 2009 ). Currently, no high-resolution structures of SAS-6 homologues from Trypanosomatids are available, and it is unclear whether oligomerization of their SAS-6 homologues could be inhibited.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Many cells have tiny hair-like structures called cilia on their surface that are important for communicating with other cells and for detecting changes in the cell\u2019s surroundings. Some cilia also beat to move fluids across the cell surface\u2014for example, to move mucus out of the lungs\u2014or act as flagella that undergo rapid whip-like movements to propel cells along. Cilia are formed when a small cylindrical structure in the cell called a centriole docks against the cell membrane and subsequently grows out. However, many of the details of this process are poorly understood. One of the earliest events in centriole assembly is the formation of a central structure that looks like a cartwheel. This cartwheel acts as a scaffold onto which the rest of the centriole is then added. It has been proposed that a protein called SAS-6 can build this cartwheel just by interacting with itself. However, this has so far not been shown clearly. Now, using a technique called X-ray crystallography, van Breugel et al. directly confirm this hypothesis. This is significant because it demonstrates that the simple self interaction of a protein could lie at the heart of building a complex structure like a centriole. The single-celled human parasites that spread diseases such as Leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and sleeping sickness rely on flagella to move around and interact with their surroundings. If SAS-6 cannot assemble into the cartwheel structure, flagella cannot form correctly, potentially stopping the parasites. By screening a library of small molecules, van Breugel et al. found one that partially disrupted the interactions of SAS-6 with itself in the test tube. This small molecule interacted only very weakly with SAS-6 and was not specific for SAS-6 from the disease-causing organism. These unfavourable properties therefore make this compound of no immediate use. However, this result nevertheless shows that small molecules can impair SAS-6 function at least in the test tube and that the development of a more efficient inhibitor might therefore be possible ."}

Here, we used single-molecule FRET to monitor the remodeling of mononucleosomes by the yeast SWI/SNF remodeler, RSC. We observed that RSC primarily translocates DNA around the nucleosome without substantial displacement of the H2A-H2B dimer. At the sites where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, the DNA moves largely along or near its canonical wrapping path. The translocation of DNA occurs in a stepwise manner, and at both sites where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, the step size distributions exhibit a peak at approximately 1\u20132 bp. These results suggest that the movement of DNA across the nucleosome is likely coupled directly to DNA translocation by the ATPase at its binding site inside the nucleosome.  The SWI/SNF-family chromatin remodelers are important regulators of chromatin structure in transcriptional activation and in the creation and maintenance of nucleosome-free regions ( Clapier and Cairns, 2009; Bowman, 2010; Becker and Workman, 2013; Narlikar et al., 2013; Bartholomew, 2014; Lorch and Kornberg, 2015 ). Consistent with these roles, SWI/SNF remodelers are capable of disrupting nucleosomes in a number of ways, including repositioning the histone octamer along the DNA, ejecting H2A-H2B dimers from the octamer, and ejecting the histone octamer from the DNA ( Clapier and Cairns, 2009; Bowman, 2010; Becker and Workman, 2013; Narlikar et al., 2013; Bartholomew, 2014; Lorch and Kornberg, 2015 ). All SWI/SNF complexes are composed of a catalytic subunit, which harbors a superfamily 2 ( SF2 ) ATPase domain, and a variety of accessory subunits ( Clapier and Cairns, 2009 ). During remodeling, the ATPase domain contacts the nucleosome at an internal site 20 bp from the nucleosome dyad, referred to as the super-helical 2 ( SHL2 ) site, and translocates DNA ( Saha et al., 2002; Saha et al., 2005; Zofall et al., 2006; Dechassa et al., 2008 ). However, how DNA translocation by the ATPase domain is coupled to the various activities of the remodeling complexes remains unclear. SWI/SNF remodelers expose substantial amounts of intra-nucleosomal DNA to nucleases during remodeling, suggesting that the remodelers disrupt the wrapping of DNA around the nucleosome ( Narlikar et al., 2001; Aoyagi et al., 2002; Lorch et al., 2010; Shukla et al., 2010 ). The nature of the disrupted intermediates remains unclear, and previous studies have suggested unpeeling of DNA from the edges of the nucleosome ( Bazett-Jones et al., 1999; Floer et al., 2010 ) as well as the formation of loops or bulges of DNA inside the nucleosome ( Narlikar et al., 2001; Kassabov et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2006; Chaban et al., 2008; Shukla et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011; Ramachandran et al., 2015 ). Given that the ATPase domain of the enzymes acts at the SHL2 site, approximately 50 and 100 bp away from the sites where the DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, respectively, how ATPase activity drives the overall movement of DNA around the nucleosome remains unclear. The isolated catalytic subunit of a SWI/SNF remodeler has been shown to translocate naked DNA ( in the absence of a histone octamer ) in ~2 bp steps ( Sirinakis et al., 2011 ). However, DNA translocation around the nucleosome by SWI/SNF holoenzyme complexes has been reported to occur in large steps of ~50 bp in size ( Zofall et al., 2006 ). It is unknown whether this 50-bp step represents the fundamental step size of nucleosome translocation by SWI/SNF complexes. The related ISWI-family of chromatin remodelers move DNA in multi-bp compound steps that are composed of 1-bp fundamental steps ( Blosser et al., 2009; Deindl et al., 2013 ). Although the ISWI-family remodelers share a homologous ATPase domain with the SWI/SNF-family remodelers, they differ in both the domains flanking the ATPase domain on their catalytic subunits and the accessory subunits that associate with the catalytic subunits ( Clapier and Cairns, 2009 ), and they bind the nucleosome differently ( Hota and Bartholomew, 2011; Dechassa et al., 2012 ). Thus, it is unclear whether SWI/SNF remodelers share a similar nucleosome translocation mechanism. In this study, we used single-molecule FRET ( Ha et al., 1996 ) with a variety of labeling schemes to monitor nucleosome remodeling by yeast RSC, a prototypical SWI/SNF-family enzyme ( Cairns et al., 1996 ), in real time. These experiments allowed us to observe transient intermediates of the remodeling process and characterize the motion of the DNA at the nucleosomal edges where the DNA moves into and out of the nucleosome. At these locations, we found that DNA was translocated largely along or near its canonical path in a stepwise manner and that the distribution of the\u00a0step sizes showed a peak at a step size of approximately 1\u20132 bp.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells package their genetic information in a \"complex\u201d of proteins and DNA called chromatin. This complex is made of units called nucleosomes, each of which consist of a short stretch of DNA wrapped around proteins known as histones. These nucleosomes restrict access to the DNA wrapped around the histone proteins, and thus serve to regulate whether genes are activated and a variety of other cellular processes. Certain enzymes regulate the structure of chromatin by altering the position and structure of nucleosomes. However, it is not clear exactly how these \u201cchromatin remodeling\u201d enzymes alter the contacts between the DNA and histone proteins to move DNA around the nucleosome. RSC is a chromatin-remodeling enzyme that typically helps to activate genes. Harada et al. used a technique called single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( or single molecule FRET for short ) to observe the movement of DNA around the histone proteins. The technique involves placing a green fluorescent dye on the histone proteins and a red fluorescent dye on the DNA. If the red dye is close to the green dye, some of the energy can be transferred from the green dye to the red dye when the green dye is excited by a laser. By looking at the ratio of green and red light emitted, it is possible to tell how far apart they are, and how this changes over time. The experiments show that the RSC enzyme moves the DNA into and out of the nucleosome in small steps. These steps match the expected step size of DNA movements by a section of the enzyme called the ATPase domain. This suggests that the ATPase domain drives the motion of DNA across the entire nucleosome. A future challenge is to better understand how chromatin remodeling enzymes cooperate with other molecules in cells to remodel nucleosomes and chromatin ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nAlthough high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ) accumulate in mammalian neurons, our knowledge of its roles in terminal differentiation or as an intermediate in active DNA demethylation is incomplete. We report high-resolution mapping of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, chromatin accessibility, and histone marks in developing postmitotic Purkinje cells ( PCs ) in Mus musculus. Our data reveal new relationships between PC transcriptional and epigenetic programs, and identify a class of genes that lose both 5-methylcytosine ( 5mC ) and 5hmC during terminal differentiation. Deletion of the 5hmC writers Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 from postmitotic PCs prevents loss of 5mC and 5hmC in regulatory domains and gene bodies, and hinders transcriptional and epigenetic developmental transitions. Our data demonstrate that Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation occurs in vivo, and that acquisition of the precise molecular properties of adult PCs require continued oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC during the final phases of differentiation.  Development of the mammalian brain requires generation of hundreds of millions of neuronal progenitors that differentiate into distinct cell types with refined functional properties. Although morphological and physiological maturation of most neurons occurs between mid-gestation and a few months or years after birth, the vast majority of CNS neurons must maintain a stable differentiated state for the life of the organism and remain sufficiently plastic to participate in novel behaviors. Studies of signaling molecules and transcriptional programs have identified many mechanisms that orchestrate critical steps in neurogenesis, cell type diversification, neuronal migration, axonal pathfinding, and differentiation. Although it has been established that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are critical for proper development of all cell types, our knowledge of the precise roles of these mechanisms in neuronal differentiation, function, and vitality remains rudimentary. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ) is produced from 5-methylcytosine ( 5mC ) by the Ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases ( Tet1, Tet2, Tet3 ) ( Iyer et al., 2009; Tahiliani et al., 2009 ). It is present at approximately 10-fold higher levels in neurons than peripheral cell types ( Globisch et al., 2010; Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009 ), and its distribution across the genome of adult neurons is cell specific and correlated with active gene expression ( Mell\u00e9n et al., 2017; Mell\u00e9n et al., 2012; Szulwach et al., 2011 ). The initial discovery that 5hmC accumulates within active gene bodies, coupled with the discovery that MeCP2 can bind probes containing 5hmC with high affinity, led to the proposal that MeCP2 binding within active genes facilitates their expression ( Mell\u00e9n et al., 2012 ). Further studies demonstrating that MeCP2 binds 5hmC at high affinity in non-CG dinucleotides but does not bind to 5hmCG overturned this model ( Ayata, 2013; Gabel et al., 2015; Mell\u00e9n et al., 2017 ) by revealing that accumulation of 5hmCG and the depletion of 5hmCH in gene bodies is correlated with less MeCP2 binding and increased expression ( Ayata, 2013; Gabel et al., 2015; Mell\u00e9n et al., 2017 ). Imaging of the binding and diffusion of single MeCP2 molecules in living neurons lacking Dnmt3a or Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 demonstrate that its binding is exquisitely sensitive to the levels of both 5mC and 5hmC ( Piccolo et al., 2019 ). Given these data and the sensitivity of neuronal function to MeCP2 gene dosage ( Chahrour et al., 2008; Nan and Bird, 2001 ), relief of the repressive functions of MeCP2 through Tet-mediated conversion of high-affinity 5mCG-binding sites to low-affinity 5hmCG sites, which we have referred to as functional demethylation ( Mell\u00e9n et al., 2017 ), provides an important mechanism for modulation of chromatin structure and transcription. In dividing cells, 5hmC serves as an intermediate in DNA demethylation because maintenance DNA methyltransferases do not recognize hemi-hydroxymethylated cytosines in order to reestablish methylation ( Wu and Zhang, 2017 ). Consequently, 5hmC is lost passively and replaced by C due to replicative dilution. Loss of function studies in mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) ( Dawlaty et al., 2013 ) and lymphocyte lineages Lio and Rao, 2019 have demonstrated that the role of Tet-mediated replicative DNA demethylation is to provide full accessibility to regulatory regions necessary for expression of genes required for differentiation. For example, at the activation-induced deaminase ( AID ) locus in B cells, Tet activity is required for demethylation and activation of enhancer regions that modulate AID expression to enable class switch recombination ( Lio et al., 2019 ). Tet-mediated replication-dependent passive demethylation is thought to be common in many dividing cell types, including progenitor cells in the developing nervous system ( MacArthur and Dawlaty, 2021 ). Most neurons exit the cell cycle during mid-gestation and remain relatively simple and undifferentiated until birth. Following parturition, they initiate an elaborate program of differentiation that includes dramatic increases in size, morphological complexity, and connectivity. Since these neurons are postmitotic and remain so throughout life, removal of the repressive effects of 5mC by passive demethylation cannot occur. However, in addition to functional demethylation and passive demethylation, a third pathway for DNA demethylation, often referred to as active demethylation, has been proposed based on the finding that 5hmC can be further oxidized by Tet proteins to produce 5-formylcytosine ( 5fC ) and 5-carboxylcytosine ( 5caC ). Removal of 5fC and 5caC by thymine DNA glycosylase ( TDG ) -dependent base excision repair ( BER ) provides another mechanism for 5hmC-mediated DNA demethylation ( He et al., 2011 ). Clear evidence that this pathway can operate in cultured cells has been presented, and detailed biochemical studies have delineated the mechanisms operating in TDG-BER DNA demethylation ( Weber et al., 2016 ). Active DNA demethylation is ideally suited for remodeling DNA methylation in postmitotic neurons. Evidence that continued accumulation of 5hmC is required in differentiating neurons and that it can participate in active demethylation in vivo is beginning to emerge. In studies of cerebellar granule cell development in ESC-derived GC cultures, primary GC cultures, and slice preparations, manipulations of Tet activity and 5hmC levels provide strong evidence that 5hmC is required for expression of axon guidance and ion channel genes, and that proper development of the GC dendritic arbor requires 5hmC ( Zhu et al., 2016 ). Demethylation of 5hmC-GFP transfected DNA fragments retrieved after several days in culture display reduced 5hmC levels at several sites as assessed by bisulfite sequencing ( BSSeq ) in HEK 293 cells and primary hippocampal neurons ( Guo et al., 2011 ). Changes in methylation levels at GGCC sites in the genome of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons in response to electroconvulsive shock have been documented using the methylation-sensitive cut counting method that employs the methylation or hydroxymethylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII and its methylation-insensitive isoschizomer Msp1 ( Guo et al., 2011 ). Global measurements of 5mC and 5hmC by mass spectroscopy in the hippocampus have shown that both decrease in response to the induction of seizure ( Kaas et al., 2013 ). And in germline Tet1 knockout mice, analysis of the Npas4 and c-Fos promoters has shown that Tet1 is required for their proper regulation in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus ( Rudenko et al., 2013 ). Despite these observations, our knowledge of the roles of continued 5hmC accumulation in active DNA demethylation and postmitotic differentiation remains rudimentary. We report here single nucleotide resolution studies of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, transcription, chromatin accessibility, and H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks in postmitotic, differentiating Purkinje cells ( PCs ). As PCs transition from relatively small, multipolar immature cells to fully elaborated large neurons with complex dendritic arbors and hundreds of thousands of synapses ( McKay and Turner, 2005 ), 5hmC continues to accumulate, and DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation are reconfigured as epigenetic and transcriptional programs progress. Our data confirm previous studies of the relationships between transcription, DNA methylation, DNA hydroxymethylation, and chromatin organization ( Lister et al., 2013; Mell\u00e9n et al., 2017; Tsagaratou et al., 2017; Tsagaratou et al., 2014 ), and they reveal several novel modes of transcriptional activation and repression. Notably, we identify a class of developmentally induced PC-specific genes that are highly expressed and lose both 5mC and 5hmC in the final stages of PC differentiation. We report also studies of newly generated Tet1, Tet2, Tet3 PC-specific triple knockout ( Pcp2TetTKO ) mouse lines in which recombination is activated in the first postnatal week. These data demonstrate that postmitotic transcriptional and epigenetic maturation in PCs, including transcription of many ion channels and active demethylation of late expressed genes, requires continued oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC. Taken together, our data demonstrate that active demethylation occurs in select genes in postmitotic neurons, and that 5hmC plays an essential role in refining the transcriptional and epigenetic status of PCs during the final stages of differentiation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: At birth, the mammalian brain contains tens of billions of neurons. Although the number does not increase much as the animal grows, there are many dramatic changes to their size and structure. These changes allow the neurons to communicate with one another, develop into networks, and learn the tasks of the adult brain. One way that these changes occur is by the accumulation of chemical marks on each neuron\u2019s DNA that help dictate which genes switch on, and which turn off. One of the most common ways that DNA can be marked is through the addition of a chemical group called a methyl group to one of the four DNA bases, cytosine. This process is called methylation. When methylation occurs, cytosine becomes 5-methylcytosine, or 5mC for short. In 2009, researchers found another modification present in the DNA in the brain: 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, or 5hmC. This modification appears when a group of proteins called the Tet hydroxylases turn 5mC into 5hmC. Converting 5mC to 5hmC normally helps cells remove marks on their DNA before they divide and expand. This is important because the newly generated cells need to be able to accumulate their own methylation marks to perform their roles properly. However, neurons in the brain accumulate 5hmC after birth, when the cells are no longer dividing, indicating that 5hmC may be required for the neurons to mature. Stoyanova et al. set out to determine whether mouse neurons need 5hmC to get their adult characteristics by tracking the chemical changes that occur in DNA from birth to adulthood. Some of the mice they tested produced 5hmC normally, while others lacked the genes necessary to make the Tet proteins in a specific class of neurons, preventing them from converting 5mC to 5hmC as they differentiate. The results reveal that neurons do not mature properly if 5hmC is not produced continuously following the first week of life. This is because neurons need to have the right genes switched on and off to differentiate correctly, and this only happens when 5hmC accumulates in some genes, while 5hmC and 5mC are removed from others. The data highlight the role of the Tet proteins, which convert 5mC into 5hmC, in preparing the marks for removal and demonstrate that active removal of these marks is essential for neuronal differentiation. Given the role of 5hmC in the development of neurons, it is possible that problems in this system could contribute to brain disorders. Further studies aimed at understanding how cells control 5hmC levels could lead to new ways to improve brain health. Research has also shown that if dividing cells lose the ability to make 5hmC, they can become cancerous. Future work could explain more about how and why this happens ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nTo elucidate new functions of sphingosine ( Sph ), we demonstrate that the spontaneous elevation of intracellular Sph levels via caged Sph leads to a significant and transient calcium release from acidic stores that is independent of sphingosine 1-phosphate, extracellular and ER calcium levels. This photo-induced Sph-driven calcium release requires the two-pore channel 1 ( TPC1 ) residing on endosomes and lysosomes. Further, uncaging of Sph leads to the translocation of the autophagy-relevant transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) to the nucleus specifically after lysosomal calcium release. We confirm that Sph accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes of cells derived from Niemann-Pick disease type C ( NPC ) patients and demonstrate a greatly reduced calcium release upon Sph uncaging. We conclude that sphingosine is a positive regulator of calcium release from acidic stores and that understanding the interplay between Sph homeostasis, calcium signaling and autophagy will be crucial in developing new therapies for lipid storage disorders such as NPC.  Sphingosine ( Sph ) and other small sphingolipids such as ceramide ( Cer ) and sphingosine 1-phosphate ( S1P ) are bioactive lipids, which play crucial roles in central cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, differentiation and senescence ( Zheng et al., 2006; Bartke and Hannun, 2009; Hannun and Obeid, 2008 ). While Cer and S1P have been extensively studied and reviewed ( Futerman and Hannun, 2004; Spiegel and Milstien, 2003; Alvarez et al., 2007; Pyne and Pyne, 2010; Arana et al., 2010 ), only limited information on the signaling mechanisms or cellular targets of Sph is available ( Jefferson and Schulman, 1988; Smith et al., 1997; Jarvis et al., 1997; Chang et al., 2001 ). In cells, Sph can be generated in lysosomes, the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) as well as the Golgi complex by hydrolysis of Cer through the action of ceramidases ( Bernardo et al., 1995; Hwang et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2008; Xu, 2006; Mao et al., 2001 ). In a physiological context, Sph is reported to mediate cell growth arrest and apoptosis ( Cuvillier, 2002; Suzuki et al., 2004 ) and is involved in the pathophysiology of the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick disease type C ( NPC ). In this progressive neurodegenerative disease, which is caused by mutations in the lysosomal proteins NPC1 or NPC2, Sph accumulates alongside other lipids such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipids ( te Vruchte et al., 2004 ). Specifically, Sph storage is the first detectable biochemical change following inactivation of NPC1 leading to chronically lowered calcium concentration in the acidic compartment, as well as subsequent secondary lipid storage ( Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008 ). On the other hand, the calcium release from acidic stores was recently monitored by a genetically encoded calcium indicator directly fused to endolysosomes which showed reduced calcium release from NPC patient cells ( Shen et al., 2012 ) in agreement with previous studies ( Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008 ) but found that the calcium content in the lysosomes remains unchanged and that the calcium release is blocked by the accumulated lipids. This is in contrast to previous studies showing that the defect in calcium levels in NPC disease is likely due to a store filling defect and that intraluminal calcium levels were reduced using an intra-lysosomal calcium probe ( Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008 ). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the interplay between calcium uptake and release from the endolysosomes and how this mechanism is deregulated in the NPC disease. Cells use calcium as a versatile tool for modulating intracellular signaling by increasing the intracellular free calcium concentration [Ca2+]i either globally or locally. Second messengers such as myo-inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate ( IP3 ) or cyclic ADP-ribose ( cADPR ) open well-characterized calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) or the muscle sarcomere, the main intracellular calcium store ( Berridge et al., 2003; Fliegert et al., 2007 ). The intraluminal calcium concentrations in the ER varies from 100\u2013800 \u00b5M ( Burdakov et al., 2005 ). Since the endosomal/lysosomal system was identified as an important source of intracellular calcium ( Haller et al., 1996 ), the luminal calcium concentrations of acidic vesicles was determined to range between 400\u2013600 \u00b5M ( Christensen et al., 2002 ). The mechanisms responsible for Ca2+filling and release from these acidic stores are not yet fully understood. The main players involved in lysosomal calcium release and signaling are transient receptor potential ( TRP ) channels such as mucolipin 1 ( TRPML1 ) ( Pryor et al., 2006 ) and two two-pore channels ( TPC1 and TPC2 ), which are thought to be Ca2+ channels activated by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NAADP ), Mg2+or phosphatidylinositol 3, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 3, 5 ) P2 ) ( Brailoiu et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Ruas et al., 2014; Brailoiu et al., 2010; Rybalchenko et al., 2012; Pitt et al., 2010; Pitt et al., 2014; Jha et al., 2014; Ruas et al., 2015; Jentsch et al., 2015 ). A very recent study showed that lysosomal calcium signaling regulates autophagy through the actions of the phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) ( Medina et al., 2015 ) which places the lysosome at the center of this very important signaling hub and underlines the importance of understanding the regulation of lysosomal calcium signaling. In this work, we investigate the role of Sph in intracellular calcium signaling by employing photoactivatable ( \u201ccaged\u201d ) Sph. Caged lipids are biologically inactive as long as they are covalently attached to certain photolabile groups ( \u201ccage groups\u201d ), which prevent recognition and metabolism inside cells. The active species is then released inside cells by short irradiation with a flash of light, which induces a cleavage reaction in the cage group ( H\u00f6glinger et al., 2014 ). In this manner, it is possible to rapidly elevate the intracellular concentration of the lipid with precise spatiotemporal resolution. It is currently difficult to know the physiological and spatial distribution of sphingosine generated under physiological conditions, particularly inside the lysosome where the majority of sphingosine is generated via the action of acidic ceramidases. This tool therefore provides a very useful system with which to probe sphingosine cell biology in greater detail. We discovered that uncaging Sph in a variety of cell types leads to an immediate and transient increase in cytosolic calcium, which is not released from the ER but from acidic stores. We further pinpoint the endosomal/lysosomal channel TPC1 to be a main contributor to this response and demonstrate that Sph-induced calcium release leads to the nuclear translocation of TFEB. We also show that the calcium release in NPC patient cells is reduced while the Sph levels in the lysosomal compartments are increased. These findings will be helpful in elucidating the pathogenic cascade of NPC and will generally further our understanding of the function of the acidic compartments in calcium homeostasis.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Sphingosine is a small fat molecule that has been suggested to act as a signal inside cells. Individuals with a rare neurodegenerative disease called Niemann-Pick disease type C accumulate sphingosine and other fat molecules in cell compartments called lysosomes. Intriguingly, this fat accumulation is accompanied by an altered movement of calcium ions in and out of lysosomes. In healthy cells, an increase in calcium ion levels can trigger a process called autophagy, in which proteins and other cell components are destroyed in a controlled manner. This is thought to be caused by the release of calcium ions from lysosomes, which stimulates a protein called TFEB to move into the nucleus of the cell to activate genes involved in autophagy. Two proteins on the surface of lysosomes called TPC1 and TPC2 are believed to act as channels that can release calcium ions from lysosomes. However, it was not clear how sphingosine could disrupt calcium ion movements in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C. Here, Hoeglinger et al. have used a new approach to understand how calcium ions and sphingosine are linked in both healthy and diseased cells. The experiments use a form of sphingosine called \u201ccaged sphingosine\u201d that is only activated when it is exposed to a flash of light, which makes it possible to increase the levels of this molecule in cells in a precise way. Hoeglinger et al. found that sphingosine triggered the release of calcium ions from lysosomes. This release required the TPC1 protein and resulted in TFEB moving into the cell nucleus. Further experiments confirm that sphingosine accumulates in the lysosomes of cells taken from patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C. In these cells, the activation of caged sphingosine resulted in a much smaller release of calcium ions from lysosomes than that observed in healthy cells. Together, Hoeglinger et al. \u2019s findings show that sphingosine acts as a signal to trigger the release of calcium ions from lysosomes, which in turn promotes autophagy. The next challenge is to find out exactly how sphingosine opens the calcium ion channels ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe role of mechanical signals in cell identity determination remains poorly explored in tissues. Furthermore, because mechanical stress is widespread, mechanical signals are difficult to uncouple from biochemical-based transduction pathways. Here we focus on the homeobox gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS ( STM ), a master regulator and marker of meristematic identity in Arabidopsis. We found that STM expression is quantitatively correlated to curvature in the saddle-shaped boundary domain of the shoot apical meristem. As tissue folding reflects the presence of mechanical stress, we test and demonstrate that STM expression is induced after micromechanical perturbations. We also show that STM expression in the boundary domain is required for organ separation. While STM expression correlates with auxin depletion in this domain, auxin distribution and STM expression can also be uncoupled. STM expression and boundary identity are thus strengthened through a synergy between auxin depletion and an auxin-independent mechanotransduction pathway at the shoot apical meristem.  Almost 100 years ago, Thomas D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Thompson proposed that shape of plants and animals could be described as a consequence of the laws of physics ( D\u2019Arcy Thompson, 1917 ). While this view has been overshadowed by the rise of molecular biology and morphogen-based patterning mechanisms, a growing contribution of mechanics in shape changes is currently emerging. In this framework, an instructing role of mechanical forces has been successfully explored theoretically ( Shraiman, 2005; Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2007 ) and there is today accumulating evidence that many molecular actors involved in development are under both biochemical and mechanical control. In particular, studies on single animal cells show that mechanical forces contribute to the control of cell division and cell polarity, and relevant mechanotransduction pathways have been identified ( e. g. Houk et al., 2012; Fink et al., 2011; Thery et al., 2007 ). The idea that mechanical stress may also play a role in defining cell identity has also emerged in the past decade ( Engler et al., 2006 Aliee et al., 2012; Landsberg et al., 2009; Farge, 2003; Brunet et al., 2013 ). However, this pioneering work is still debated and a role of mechanical signals in cell identity during development remains an open question. Furthermore, all the currently known mechanotransduction pathways involve elements of established biochemical-based transduction pathway ( e. g. Janmey et al., 2013; Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009; Orr et al., 2006 ). Assuming mechanical signals play an important role in development, one may thus question the added value of mechanical signals in development if their action is so tightly coupled to biochemical signaling. Because their development is slow, iterative and does not involve cell movements, plants are systems of choice to explore the possible contribution of mechanical signals in proprioception, i. e. in channeling growth and identity from intrinsically generated mechanical stresses. Mechanical cues contribute to the emergence of lateral roots in Arabidopsis ( Ditengou et al., 2008; Richter et al., 2009 ), the expression level of the transcription factor PtaZFP2 correlates to the amount of bending in poplar stems ( Coutand et al., 2009 ) and the expression of the ELA1 gene in a specific cell layer of the developing seed is triggered by mechanical signals that are generated by the growth of the embryo against the endosperm ( Creff et al., 2015 ). While these studies suggest that physical forces can contribute to cell identity definition in plants, this remains to be fully demonstrated. A fitting system for this question is the shoot apical meristem ( SAM ), which contains a plant stem cell niche and controls the formation and identity of all aerial organs. Because cells are glued to each other, differential growth generates mechanical conflicts leading to shape changes. For instance, tissue folding occurs in the boundary domain of the SAM between the slow growing meristem and the fast growing organ. Because the epidermis is load-bearing ( Dumais and Steele, 2000; Kutschera and Niklas, 2007 ), the boundary domain is characterized by a highly anisotropic mechanical stress; this mechanical stress controls microtubule orientation, which in turn channels growth direction and promotes tissue folding ( Burian et al., 2013; Hamant et al., 2008 ). A contribution of mechanical stress in the polarity of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 1 ( PIN1 ) was also proposed suggesting an indirect contribution of mechanical signals in auxin patterns and thus in organogenesis at the shoot apex ( Heisler et al., 2010; Nakayama et al., 2012 ). While the genetic bases of meristem functions are now well documented, a link between these genetic regulators and mechanical signals remains to be identified in the SAM. The homeodomain transcription factor SHOOT MERISTEMLESS ( STM ) is a key regulator of meristem functions and its expression is often considered as the best marker of meristematic identity. In the shoot apical meristem, STM is expressed ubiquitously, with the exception of young primordia where it is down-regulated ( Long et al., 1996 ). Interestingly, the STM promoter has previously been reported to be more active in the boundary domains of the SAM ( Heisler et al., 2005; Leasure et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2003; Jurkuta et al., 2009 ). In line with this observation, STM expression is regulated by several boundary specific genes ( Aida et al., 1999; Borghi et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009; Takada et al., 2001 ), in part via auxin signaling ( Aida et al., 2002; Treml et al., 2005 ). Because the boundary domain is also a site under mechanical stress, we investigated whether such stresses could act as signals to control STM expression at the shoot apical meristem.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The bending, stretching or squashing of cells or tissues can be used as a signal to trigger a range of biological responses. However investigating the role of these mechanical signals remains a challenge. This is partly because the forces that trigger the mechanical signals are often short-lived and changeable, and partly because the signals can be difficult to separate from the biochemical responses that they generate. Stem cells present at the tip of the growing shoots in a plant are exposed to mechanical forces. These growing tips are called shoot meristems, and the stem cells they contain create all the aboveground organs of the plant ( stems, leaves and flowers etc. ). In each meristem, a boundary forms between the slow-growing stem cells at its centre and the fast-growing organs that form around them. Because these plant cells are both stuck together by their cell walls and growing at different rates, strong mechanical stresses are created causing this boundary to fold. A key regulator of the meristem is a protein called STM, but it remains unclear whether mechanical signals are involved in the control of this protein. To investigate this, Landrein et al. tracked where the gene for the STM protein was switch on in shoot meristems in a plant called Arabidopsis, and found that it is highly active at the boundary. Analysing STM in different mutant plants combined with advanced imaging techniques revealed that STM activity correlates with the extent of creasing at this boundary. The STM protein is also required at the boundary to ensure that developing organs separate out. These findings suggest that boundary folding might somehow create signals that activate STM. One candidate signal was the plant hormone called auxin because reduced levels of this hormone were previously associated with boundary formation. However, in further experiments, Landrein et al. ruled out auxin\u2019s involvement in this process. So do mechanical signals activate STM at the boundary ? To test this, the mechanical forces in the meristem were altered by compressing the growing shoot meristems in miniature vices and by killing a few stem cells at the meristem centre. Both of these actions triggered the production of STM in the meristem, consistent with its activity being altered by mechanical stress. Landrein et al. propose that the mechanical regulation identified acts in parallel to auxin signalling, providing robustness to the regulation of gene activity in the shoot meristem. In other words, tissue folding can guide gene expression, via the production of mechanical signals. But how shoot meristem cells respond at a molecular level to mechanical stress awaits future work. Finally, proteins related to STM can be found in all biological kingdoms, including some proteins that regulate important process in animal development. Whether the activity of these related proteins is also regulated by mechanical forces remains to be investigated ."}

To discover regulatory mechanisms in canonical WNT signaling, we conducted a systematic forward genetic analysis through reporter-based screens in haploid human cells. Comparison of screens for negative, attenuating and positive regulators of WNT signaling, mediators of R-spondin-dependent signaling and suppressors of constitutive signaling induced by loss of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli or casein kinase 1\u03b1 uncovered new regulatory features at most levels of the pathway. These include a requirement for the transcription factor AP-4, a role for the DAX domain of AXIN2 in controlling \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity, a contribution of glycophosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis and glypicans to R-spondin-potentiated WNT signaling, and two different mechanisms that regulate signaling when distinct components of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex are lost. The conceptual and methodological framework we describe should enable the comprehensive understanding of other signaling systems.  Cellular signaling systems have evolved complex circuitry involving multiple layers of regulation, making their comprehensive characterization a major challenge. Forward genetics in model organisms has been a general and unbiased way to identify new components in signaling pathways and to map their connectivity. However, since signaling pathways have often diverged between humans and these simpler model systems, their analysis in human cells becomes an important goal. Indeed, our ability to identify the best therapeutic strategy or to predict the effectiveness of drugs targeting specific proteins is often hampered by an incomplete understanding of signaling circuitry in human cells ( Lito et al., 2013 ). Recent methodological advances have enabled the interrogation of biological processes in human cells through powerful genome-wide screens that overcome many of the limitations associated with previous platforms ( Carette et al., 2009; Gilbert et al., 2014; Shalem et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014 ). Yet, inferring functional relationships in complex pathways from such screens remains a major obstacle that has only recently began to be addressed ( Bassik et al., 2013; Blomen et al., 2015; Parnas et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015 ). Genetics has long relied on the use of sensitized backgrounds, modifier screens and synthetic effects to uncover the myriad layers of regulation in signaling pathways. We reasoned that one way to discover both epistatic relationships on a genome scale and unique context-specific requirements would be through the quantitative comparison of genome-wide screens in which the pathway is activated by different ligands, and of suppressor screens following targeted disruption of critical nodes. We took advantage of two methodologies to conduct a systematic genetic analysis of WNT signaling in human cells: forward genetics in haploid cells using gene trap ( GT ) -based insertional mutagenesis ( Carette et al., 2009 ), and targeted genome engineering by clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) /CRISPR-associated protein 9 ( Cas9 ) ( Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013 ). The WNT pathway is a fundamental signaling system that plays central roles in embryonic development, regeneration and cancer ( reviewed in Hoppler and Moon, 2014 ). During development, WNT signaling orchestrates transcriptional programs that regulate cell proliferation and survival, cell fate determination, and tissue patterning. In adults, WNT signaling is instrumental in defining stem cell niches in multiple organs, which\u00a0maintain tissue homeostasis during routine turnover or following injury. Overactive WNT signaling can be oncogenic, driving both the initiation and maintenance of various types of cancer, most notably colorectal cancer ( CRC ). While the pathway has been studied intensively ( we provide a snapshot in Figure 1A and refer readers to the legend for details ), critical steps remain poorly understood even 34 years after the discovery of \u2018int1\u2019, as mammalian WNT was initially called ( Nusse and Varmus, 1982 ). The complex circuitry of the pathway may mask unknown regulatory mechanisms overlaid on the core module, making it an ideal system for an in-depth, methodical genetic dissection, extending a rich tradition of genetic studies ( N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980 ). Known pathway components would serve to benchmark any new discoveries, and new discoveries would likely have important therapeutic implications due to the pathway\u2019s direct relevance to stem cell biology and cancer. 10. 7554/eLife. 21459. 003Figure 1. Reporter-based, forward genetic screens in haploid human cells identify negative, attenuating and positive regulators of WNT signaling. ( A ) Schematic model of canonical\u00a0WNT signaling, highlighting the main pathway components and regulatory events in the absence ( left panel ) and presence ( center panel ) of ligands, and other known regulators relevant to this work ( right panel ). When the pathway is off, the transcriptional co-activator \u03b2-catenin ( CTNNB1 ) is constitutively targeted for proteasomal degradation by the destruction complex, composed of the scaffold proteins adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) and AXIN, and the kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) and casein kinase 1\u03b1 ( CSNK1A1 ). The T-cell-specific transcription factor ( TCF ) /lymphoid enhancer-binding factor ( LEF ) family of transcription factors, together with transducin like enhancer of split ( TLE ) and histone deacetylases ( HDAC ), repress WNT target genes. Binding of WNT to its co-receptors frizzled ( FZD ) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 ( LRP6 ) leads to the assembly of a receptor complex that inactivates the destruction complex through a mechanism involving recruitment of AXIN by LRP6 and the adapter protein dishevelled ( DVL ). Consequently, CTNNB1 accumulates in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus and promotes WNT target gene transcription in cooperation with TCF/LEF and other co-activators such as CREB-binding protein ( CREBBP ) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9 protein ( BCL9 ). R-spondins ( RSPOs ) are secreted proteins that potentiate the response of stem cells to WNT ligands by blocking the degradation of FZD and LRP6 receptors. RSPO binds to leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors ( LGRs ) and neutralizes two transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases, ZNRF3\u00a0and\u00a0RNF43, that clear WNT receptors from the cell surface. Other regulatory mechanisms include modulation of AXIN levels by the poly ADP-ribosylation-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146, and recruitment of DOT1L and MLLT10, two proteins involved in histone H3 K79 methylation, to WNT target genes.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 21459. 004 We initially probed the intact pathway through genome-wide, forward genetic screens for negative, attenuating and positive regulators to define the basic set of genes required for signaling in haploid human cells. We identified many of the known core pathway components and found a new requirement for the transcription factor AP-4 ( TFAP4 ). Unexpectedly, these screens uncovered a dominant allele of AXIN2 that dissociated \u03b2-catenin ( CTNNB1 ) protein stabilization, considered the decisive event in WNT signaling, from its transcriptional activity. To find factors required for amplification of WNT responses by R-spondins ( RSPOs, Figure 1A ), we devised a sensitized screen for RSPO-enhanced WNT signaling and uncovered a requirement for the glycophosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor biosynthetic machinery and glypicans. Finally, we searched for mutations that could suppress constitutive signaling in cells with compromised function of the CTNNB1 destruction complex, recapitulating the most common defect in oncogenic WNT signaling. Suppressor screens in cells lacking adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) or casein kinase 1\u03b1 ( CSNK1A1 ), the two rate-limiting negative regulators of the pathway in haploid cells, revealed two distinct mechanisms that regulate CTNNB1 abundance and transcriptional\u00a0activity, respectively. One mechanism was specific to cells lacking CSNK1A1, but not APC, suggesting that different components of the destruction complex have different functions in WNT signaling beyond their common function controlling CTNNB1 protein abundance. Through a quantitative comparative analysis across seven screens, we confirmed epistatic relationships for known regulators and predicted them for new ones. The combined results of these screens provide a comprehensive resource for understanding the\u00a0regulation of canonical WNT signaling.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: When an embryo is developing, its cells must communicate with one another to coordinate the processes that shape the body\u2019s tissues and organs. Cells often communicate by releasing signaling molecules that engage with proteins called receptors on the surface of other cells. This triggers a series of events that sends the signal along a \u201cpathway\u201d of biochemical reactions inside the receiving cell and leads to the activation of genes. One such signaling pathway is triggered by the WNT proteins and is used extensively in all animals. The WNT pathway instructs cells to grow and divide, establishes the identity of specific cell types and maintains populations of stem cells that can regenerate tissues in adulthood as well. The WNT pathway must be carefully regulated because various types of cancer can develop if the pathway becomes too active. Some signaling pathways are well conserved between different animals. Many genetic studies into the WNT pathway have focused on animals that are easier to work with in the laboratory, like worms or flies. However, there may be differences in the way these pathways are regulated between these model animals and humans. Therefore, to understand how the WNT pathway operates in humans, it was important to study it in human cells too. Lebensohn et al. have now carried out a series of genetic screens in human cells that contain only one copy of each gene instead of the usual two. These cells \u2013 referred to as haploid cells \u2013 are ideal for genetic studies because only a single copy of a gene has to be disrupted in order to analyze the consequences of that gene\u2019s loss. The screens searched for genes that regulate WNT signaling: those that keep the pathway \u201coff\u201d in the absence of WNT and those that turn the pathway \u201con\u201d in response to WNT. By comparing the outcomes of these screens, Lebensohn et al. identified previously unknown regulators and uncovered new roles for known regulators of the WNT pathway. For instance, a regulator called TFAP4, which had not previously been linked to the pathway, was shown to activate WNT signaling. In another case, enzymes that make molecules called glycophosphatidylinositol anchors, and cell-surface proteins that are modified with those anchors, were found to amplify WNT signaling. Lebensohn et al. also identified genes that were needed to sustain the uncontrolled WNT signaling in cells that carried cancer-causing mutations in this pathway. Further studies could now explore if drugs can target these genes, or the molecules encoded by them, to treat cancers in which the WNT pathway is excessively activated. Other studies could also use the same methods to explore more signaling pathways and gain new insights into important biological processes in human cells ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nPathogens rely on proteins embedded on their surface to perform tasks essential for host infection. These obligatory structures exposed to the host immune system provide important targets for rational vaccine design. Here, we use a systematically designed series of multi-domain constructs in combination with small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS ) to determine the structure of the main immunoreactive region from a major antigen from Leptospira interrogans, LigB. An anti-LigB monoclonal antibody library exhibits cell binding and bactericidal activity with extensive domain coverage complementing the elongated architecture observed in the SAXS structure. Combining antigenic motifs in a single-domain chimeric immunoglobulin-like fold generated a vaccine that greatly enhances leptospiral protection over vaccination with single parent domains. Our study demonstrates how understanding an antigen\u2019s structure and antibody accessible surfaces can guide the design and engineering of improved recombinant antigen-based vaccines.  The molecular details of how surface antigens of a pathogen are exposed to the host\u2019s defenses are highly relevant to rational vaccine development ( Rappuoli et al., 2016; Dormitzer et al., 2012; Dormitzer et al., 2008 ). The structural context of immunologically accessible epitopes allows for the redesign of recombinant vaccine scaffolds to display the most antigenic surfaces ( Correia et al., 2014; Malito et al., 2014 ). The exploration of recombinant strategies can be particularly fruitful when classical vaccine strategies provide weak protection. Currently available inactivated vaccines against leptospirosis, the most common bacterial zoonosis ( Picardeau, 2017 ), are inadequate because of the severe side-effects and lack of cross-protection among pathogenic Leptospira species ( Grassmann et al., 2017; Adler, 2015 ). Because the estimated worldwide burden of leptospirosis is over 1 million severe cases and\u00a0~60, 000 deaths per year, advances in recombinant leptospiral vaccines are desperately needed and are likely to benefit from a structure-based antigen design strategy ( Picardeau, 2017; Costa et al., 2015 ). While several leptospiral antigens have been explored for use in vaccines, the most promising candidates have been derived from the Leptospira immunoglobulin-like ( Lig ) protein family ( Ko et al., 2009; Grassmann et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2007 ). Lig proteins are present in only pathogenic species with LigB ( but not LigA or LigC ) being found in all pathogenic Leptospira genomes ( McBride et al., 2009; Matsunaga et al., 2003 ), LigB\u2019s expression during host invasion further suggests an important role in virulence ( Lessa-Aquino et al., 2017; Choy et al., 2007 ). To promote infection, LigB can bind multiple blood factors and extracellular matrix molecules ( ECMs ) to facilitate immune system evasion and tissue colonization ( Choy, 2012; Vieira et al., 2014; Figueira et al., 2011 ). The persistence and exposure of LigB on the leptospiral outer membrane during infection leaves an exploitable vulnerability. Recently, a hamster immunization study has suggested that LigB-derived vaccines have the potential to confer sterile immunity against leptospiral challenge ( Conrad et al., 2017 ). The new study ( Conrad et al., 2017 ) is inconsistent with earlier LigB vaccine studies which only confer partial protection ( Yan et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2007 ) and raises the possibility of further improvements in LigB-derived vaccine efficiency through rational design. Our understanding of the LigB structure is limited to the NMR structure of the individual Lig protein Ig-like domain ( Ptak et al., 2014 ). LigB is attached to the leptospiral outer surface by a short N-terminal anchor, which is followed by a stretch of twelve consecutive Ig-like domains, and flanked at its C-terminus by an additional non-Ig-like domain ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ). Most host interactions with Lig protein have been identified within the Ig-like domain regions and previously reported LigB-based vaccines have targeted the Ig-like domain region ( Yan et al., 2009; Conrad et al., 2017; Breda et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2009a ). A more comprehensive understanding of the domain arrangement would provide a picture of the most accessible antigenic regions and a guide for structure-based vaccine design. In this study, small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS ) ( Skou et al., 2014 ) was used to obtain a low-resolution solution structure of the Ig-like domain region\u2019s architecture. The full LigB Ig-like domain region\u2019s extended arrangement with notable bends encouraged the exploration of the highly-exposed surface for immunoreactivity with a library of anti-LigB monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ). The capability of these mAbs to bind antigen and to adhere to the surface of pathogenic Leptospira was then correlated with their ability to kill these bacteria in the presence of serum complements. Finally, the identified mAb-reactive domains and previously obtained LigB12 ( LigB 12th Ig-like domain ) NMR structure informed the generation of chimeras on single Ig-like domain scaffolds capable of eliciting an immune response with either side of the \u03b2-sandwich domain. To illustrate the potential for rationally engineered antigens, a vaccine containing the chimera LigB10-B7-B7, which displays identified mAb-interacting surfaces from LigB7 and LigB10, offered greatly improved protection over LigB7 and LigB10 against leptospiral lethal challenge in hamsters. These findings provide a blueprint for combining immunoreactivity mapping from an mAb library and high-resolution structural information from NMR to engineer epitopes and improve the efficacy of LigB vaccines as well as recombinant vaccines from other pathogens.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Vaccines encourage the immune system to develop a protection against disease-causing bacteria and viruses. Some types of immune cells release antibodies, which recognize particular proteins on the surface of the invading microbe. A vaccine that contains these surface proteins allows immune cells to develop the antibodies that can help to fight off an infection at a later date. Studying the shape and structure of the surface proteins can reveal how they are detected by our immune systems and can further be used to design more effective vaccines. Leptospirosis is the most common bacterial disease to affect both humans and animals. The symptoms of the disease include fever, muscle pain and bleeding from the lungs. New vaccines against leptospirosis are desperately needed because current ones have severe side effects and do not fully protect against the disease. The most promising new vaccine candidates are the Lig proteins, which are found on the surface of leptospirosis causing bacteria cells, but little was known about their molecular structure. The region of the Lig protein that is recognized by the immune system consists of a series of twelve connected \u2018immunoglobulin-like\u2019 domains. Hsieh, Ptak et al. used X-ray scattering to determine the structure of this region and found that the protein is highly elongated. Additional experiments showed that the individual domains provoke immune responses to different extents. Antibodies that can interact more strongly with the Lig protein were also better able to kill the bacteria. Based on this information, Hsieh, Ptak et al. combined parts of the individual domains that bind strongly to antibodies to design a new protein that, when used as a vaccine, protected hamsters against leptospirosis much better than other Lig protein-based vaccines. Further engineering and testing are required to develop an optimized, commercial leptospirosis vaccine, but the work of Hsieh, Ptak et al. shows the effectiveness of structure-based vaccine design methods. In the future, similar methods could be used to develop better vaccines and treatments for other infectious diseases ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe dynamic assembly of multi-protein complexes underlies fundamental processes in cell biology. A mechanistic understanding of assemblies requires accurate measurement of their stoichiometry, affinity and cooperativity, and frequently consideration of multiple co-existing complexes. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation equipped with fluorescence detection ( FDS-SV ) allows the characterization of protein complexes free in solution with high size resolution, at concentrations in the nanomolar and picomolar range. Here, we extend the capabilities of FDS-SV with a single excitation wavelength from single-component to multi-component detection using photoswitchable fluorescent proteins ( psFPs ). We exploit their characteristic quantum yield of photo-switching to imprint spatio-temporal modulations onto the sedimentation signal that reveal different psFP-tagged protein components in the mixture. This novel approach facilitates studies of heterogeneous multi-protein complexes at orders of magnitude lower concentrations and for higher-affinity systems than previously possible. Using this technique we studied high-affinity interactions between the amino-terminal domains of GluA2 and GluA3 AMPA receptors.  The dynamic formation of multi-protein complexes is a key step in the assembly of supramolecular structures and in the regulation of many cellular processes ( Wu, 2013; Li et al., 2012; Gavin et al., 2002; Krogan et al., 2006; Wu and Fuxreiter, 2016 ). For example, in immunological signal transduction the assembly of adaptor protein complexes into micro-clusters after T-cell activation plays a critical role in the sensitivity and specificity of activation ( Sherman et al., 2011; Dustin and Groves, 2012 ). Another well-known multi-protein complex is the post-synaptic density, a large structure assembled via interactions between many different scaffolding proteins, signaling proteins and ligand gated ion channels, that regulates postsynaptic neurotransmission and plasticity ( Kennedy, 2000; Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2007; Kumar and Mayer, 2012 ). Many of the protein interactions involved in the assembly of such molecular machinery are multivalent ( Li et al., 2012; Houtman et al., 2006; Coussens et al., 2013 ). This often allows structurally polymorph complexes to co-exist ( Wu and Fuxreiter, 2016 ), posing formidable challenges for any biophysical method to elucidate basic architectural principles and driving forces, which requires the study of reversible interactions of multiple protein components with multiple states. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation ( SV ) is a classical technique that allows determination of the number, size, and shape of reversibly formed protein complexes, and provides information on their affinity, stoichiometry and binding kinetics ( Schuck, 2013, 2015 ). Though a long established technique, it is worth recapitulating the basic principles of SV ( Figure 1 ). In SV the spatio-temporal evolution of macromolecular concentration profiles in a sample solution after application of a strong centrifugal field is optically monitored in real-time. SV has unique opportunities for studying protein interactions, since\u2014different from separation techniques\u2014faster sedimenting protein complexes will always remain in a bath of slower-sedimenting constituent components, such that the association/dissociation of non-covalent complexes is maintained throughout the experiment ( Figure 1 ). Since sedimentation takes place free in solution, the analysis can be based on first principles and mathematical models for the sedimentation/diffusion process, and modern size-distribution analysis results in sedimentation coefficient distributions with high hydrodynamic resolution. Thus, SV has emerged as a powerful technique in the study of the solution state behavior of complex interacting systems of macromolecules, including ion-channels, adaptor proteins, membrane proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates ( Kumar and Mayer, 2012; Houtman et al., 2005; le Maire et al., 2008 Niewiarowski et al., 2010; Padrick and Brautigam, 2011; Harding et al., 2015; Jose et al., 2012 ). Extended to multi-signal analysis SV can distinguish different sedimenting components from characteristic extinction properties, directly revealing binding stoichiometries and resolving co-existing complexes ( Houtman et al., 2006; Coussens et al., 2013; Padrick and Brautigam, 2011; Balbo et al., 2005; Barda-Saad et al., 2010 ). For example, through applications of this approach an essential mechanism for the formation of signaling particles in T-cell activation ( Houtman et al., 2006; Coussens et al., 2013; Barda-Saad et al., 2010 ) was discovered to be the multivalent intracellular oligomerization of LAT via three-component adaptor protein complexes ( Houtman et al., 2006 ). Such biophysical multi-protein solution studies naturally complement super-resolution fluorescence imaging and co-localization studies of live cells ( Sherman et al., 2011; Houtman et al., 2006; Coussens et al., 2013; Barda-Saad et al., 2010 ). But, unfortunately, traditional SV is limited in several ways by optical detection systems that generally require the use of micromolar concentrations of purified proteins. 10. 7554/eLife. 17812. 003Figure 1. Concentration profiles in a sedimentation velocity experiment. Two different macromolecular components are depicted ( blue and red ) reversibly forming a complex ( magenta ). As a result of centrifugal force at 200, 000\u2013300, 000 g, macromolecules sediment at a rate determined by their mass, density, and Stokes radius ( or translational friction coefficient ) ( Svedberg and Rinde, 1924 ). The velocity of sedimentation normalized relative to the centrifugal field strength is expressed in the molecular sedimentation coefficient s. With time, transport clears the region of the solution column closest to the center of rotation and a moving front is formed -- the sedimentation boundary \u2013 that separates the cleared zone from a zone of constant concentration named the solution plateau region. While the boundary moves with time ( dashed vs solid line ), the concentration in the plateau region continuously decreases, solely due the radial geometry of sedimentation resulting in an increase in intermolecular distances ( for a detailed description, see Schuck et al., 2015 ). If protein interactions cause complexes to form, these generally sediment faster and therefore migrate through a bath of slower sedimenting free constituent components. This allows association/dissociation reactions to continuously occur in a way that reflects equilibrium and kinetic properties of the interaction, at the same time as the complex boundaries are hydrodynamically resolved ( Schuck, 2010 ). The temporal evolution of the boundary shapes is governed by macromolecular diffusion and polydispersity, and the latter can be extracted by mathematical modeling of experimental data in form of sedimentation coefficient distributions ( Schuck, 2000 ). DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 17812. 003 Recently, analytical ultracentrifugation was enhanced by the availability of a commercial fluorescence optical detection system ( FDS ), that uses confocal detection radially scanning the sample in the spinning rotor ( MacGregor et al., 2004 ) ( Figure 2a ). After accounting for characteristic data features, the FDS allows highly quantitative analyses of the sedimentation process ( Zhao et al., 2013b ), extending the sensitivity of SV by several orders of magnitude into the low picomolar range ( Zhao et al., 2014a; Le Roy et al., 2015 ). This enables the measurement of binding energies in self- and hetero-association with very high affinity ( Zhao et al., 2012; 2013a; 2014a ), and also makes it possible to study proteins that are relatively scarce, not well purified, and in some cases even in cell extracts ( Le Roy et al., 2015; Polling et al., 2013; Kingsbury and Laue, 2011; Kokona et al., 2015 ). Unfortunately, these advantages come with a drawback of having only a single excitation wavelength, either 488 nm or 561 nm, due to the technical constraints of accommodating a moveable confocal optical system inside the evacuated rotor chamber of the ultracentrifuge. Thus, spectral discrimination of multiple components is not available in AUC fluorescence detection, which significantly limits the study of multi-protein complexes. 10. 7554/eLife. 17812. 004Figure 2. Principle of fluorescence detected sedimentation velocity and optical switching of psFPs. ( a ) Schematic setup: A rotating sample solution is scanned radially in a confocal configuration with 488 nm excitation ( 13 mW unless mentioned otherwise ), inducing slow photoswitching of psFPs. Centrifugal forces cause strongly size-dependent migration, as depicted in Figure 1. Optionally, localized exposure at 488 nm or uniform illumination at 405 nm can further modulate the spatio-temporal signal. ( b-f ) Radial fluorescence scans ( dots, color indicating times in order purple-blue-green-yellow-red; every 2nd scan shown ) during sedimentation at 50, 000 rpm and 20\u00b0C for different fluorophores and illumination conditions. More detailed inspection of the data is possible from the associated movies. Solid lines are the best-fit with a single-species ( c to f ) or distribution ( b ) model for the sedimentation/diffusion/photoswitching process; residuals are shown in the lower panels. ( b ) For DL488-GluA2 ( 5 nM ) only a small depletion of plateau signal with time occurs, due to sample dilution as geometrically predicted from radial migration in the sector-shaped sample solution. ( see Video 1 ) ( c ) rsEGFP ( 30 nM ) exhibits an exponential depletion of the sedimentation signal ( see Video 2 ). ( d ) Exposure in the scanning beam causes Padron ( 20 nM ) to switch from predominantly dark to a fluorescent state, causing an exponentially saturating signal increase with time ( see Video 3 ). ( e ) The sedimentation of 10 nM rsEGFP2-GluA3 is recorded with a 25 mW scanning beam, interrupted by 120 s\u00a0exposures with 405 nm light at time points 40 min ( prior to the purple scans ), 64 min ( prior to the blue scans ), and 102 min ( prior to the green scans ), each time switching fluorophores from dark state back to the fluorescent state ( see Video 4 ). ( f ) 5 min into the sedimentation run of 5 nM rsEGFP2-GluA3, a localized initial trough was generated by holding the scanning beam stationary at 6. 5 cm for 20 min, locally causing strong conversion of fluorophores into the dark state. Standard scans of the sedimentation process follow, highlighting diffusion into the trough superimposed by migration and slow switching off ( see Video 5 ). DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 17812. 004 In the present work, we embark on a different approach for multi-component analysis based on photophysical properties of photoswitchable fluorescent proteins ( psFPs ). The psFPs make up a class of fluorescent proteins that can be actively switched between fluorescent and non-fluorescent states using different wavelengths of illumination. While they have been engineered for entirely different purposes in nanoscience and fluorescence imaging, we have previously observed that under the illumination conditions of FDS-SV they are induced to slowly switch by virtue of the excitation light when radially scanning the spinning sample ( Zhao et al., 2014b ). Even though the mechanism of photoswitching in psFPs generally may involve multiple states, in the low-power exposure that occurs during sedimentation using the FDS the process is quantitatively modeled very well as a single exponential. This is exploited and further developed in the present work. Different classes of psFPs exhibit different time-courses of photoswitching in FDS-SV, and may be switched on to a fluorescent state or switched off to a dark state. We show that this process is highly quantitative, and how this signal change can be manipulated spatially and temporally during sedimentation. The new spatio-temporal signal dimension is folded into the computational analysis of the sedimentation process, and thus offers an avenue for monochromatic multi-component ( MCMC ) detection. Using existing commercial FDS instrumentation, the MCMC approach allows us to simultaneously determine separate sedimentation coefficient distributions for each class of fluorophore, which can be used to determine the identity and binding stoichiometry of hydrodynamically resolved complexes of psFP-tagged proteins. We first demonstrate experimental proof of principle of exploiting the photo-switching kinetics as a novel aspect of fluorophore analysis. Using psFPs commonly employed in super-resolution microscopy, we show an example for the identification of binding partners in a three-component protein mixture. We then use this approach to study the high-affinity interactions of glutamate receptor GluA2 and GluA3 amino terminal domains, which engage in competitive homo-dimerization and hetero-dimerization processes that are thought to control the combination of receptor subtypes into diverse homomeric and heteromeric ion channel tetramers with different gating properties ( Kumar and Mayer, 2012; Rossmann et al., 2011; Herguedas et al., 2016 ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Many proteins in cells combine to form molecular machines or complexes that carry out specific processes inside cells. Analytical ultracentrifugation is a technique commonly used to explore the physical properties of proteins and their complexes and in this way to gain insights into the biological roles of these molecules. The technique involves spinning a sample containing the molecules to generate a strong centrifugal force, while monitoring the movement of the molecules. Under these conditions, molecules with different sizes and masses sink \u2013 or \u201csediment\u201d \u2013 at different rates, so individual proteins and their complexes can be clearly distinguished. Analytical ultracentrifugation was recently extended to make it possible to detect fluorescent tags added on to proteins. This advance allowed researchers to study more dilute samples or complexes that are held together especially tightly. However, only tags of a single color can be detected because of physical constraints of the fluorescent detection system. This meant that only one kind of fluorescent signal could be tracked at any one time. However, a group of fluorescent tags called photoswitchable fluorescent proteins ( psFPs ) offer new opportunities for detecting multiple signals. This is because these psFPs switch between fluorescent and non-fluorescent states while being detected in the ultracentrifuge. Zhao et al. have now exploited this unique photoswitching property by accurately measuring how fast a number of psFPs switched between fluorescent and non-fluorescent states while they were sedimenting. Each different psFPs switched in a distinct way, even for psFPs of the same color, meaning that each psFP could be identified from its switching rate, similar to identifying a person from their fingerprints. This discovery allowed Zhao et al. to distinguish different psFPs in a mixed sample as if they had different colors. Further experiments went on to demonstrate that this approach could identify the binding proteins in a protein mixture made of three components, and be used to study a biologically important protein complex that can itself exist in two distinct forms. The approach will therefore provide a valuable tool to observe different components in a complex individually and will provide researchers the opportunity to study how mixed protein complexes form at very low concentrations. Future developments of the approach may make it possible to study other properties of protein complexes such as their overall shape and their behavior under conditions that mimic those inside the cell ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nAlthough aging-regulating pathways were discovered a few decades ago, it is not entirely clear how their activities are orchestrated, to govern lifespan and proteostasis at the organismal level. Here, we utilized the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to examine whether the alteration of aging, by reducing the activity of the Insulin/IGF signaling ( IIS ) cascade, affects protein SUMOylation. We found that IIS activity promotes the SUMOylation of the germline protein, CAR-1, thereby shortening lifespan and impairing proteostasis. In contrast, the expression of mutated CAR-1, that cannot be SUMOylated at residue 185, extends lifespan and enhances proteostasis. A mechanistic analysis indicated that CAR-1 mediates its aging-altering functions, at least partially, through the notch-like receptor glp-1. Our findings unveil a novel regulatory axis in which SUMOylation is utilized to integrate the aging-controlling functions of the IIS and of the germline and provide new insights into the roles of SUMOylation in the regulation of organismal aging.  The view that aging is solely driven by stochastic events has changed as mounting evidences showed that certain, apparently independent, genetic and metabolic modulations, slow aging and extend lifespans of various organisms. Dietary restriction ( DR ), reduced activity of the insulin/IGF signaling pathway ( IIS ) or of the mitochondrial electron transport chain ( ETC ), and removal of germ cells ( Kenyon, 2005 ), all slow the pace of aging. Among these, most prominent is IIS reduction, which extends lifespan and elevates stress resistance of worms ( Kenyon et al., 1993 ), mice ( Holzenberger et al., 2003 ), and presumably humans ( Suh et al., 2008 ). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ), the sole insulin/IGF receptor, DAF-2, initiates a signaling cascade that negatively regulates the activity of at least three transcription factors by modulating phosphorylation. Direct phosphorylation of DAF-16/FOXO ( Lee et al., 2001 ) and of SKN-1/NRF ( Tullet et al., 2008 ) prevents these factors from entering the nucleus and from regulating their target genes. Similarly, the IIS inhibits the phosphorylation of DDL-1, which retains the Heat Shock Factor 1 ( HSF-1 ) in the cytosol ( Chiang et al., 2012 ). Thus, IIS reduction by daf-2 RNA interference ( RNAi ) or by mutation, hyperactivates its downstream transcription factors, creating long-lived worms ( Kenyon, 2005 ). IIS reduction also elevates resistance to a variety of stresses including heat ( Lithgow et al., 1995 ), ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation ( Murakami and Johnson, 1996 ), and pathogenic bacteria ( Singh and Aballay, 2006 ). In addition, IIS reduction protects worms and mice from toxic aggregation ( proteotoxicity ) of various neurodegeneration-causing proteins ( reviewed in Carvalhal Marques et al., 2015 ). Finally, IIS reduction also modulates reproduction and egg-laying patterns, as knocking down daf-2 by RNAi, reduces the worm\u2019s brood size but extends the reproduction period ( Dillin et al., 2002 ). Although it was shown that the IIS is locally neutralized in germ cells ( Narbonne et al., 2015 ) and that DAF-2 responds to food availability by modulating oogenesis through RAS-ERK signaling ( Lopez et al., 2013 ), whether changes in post-translational modifications are involved in the IIS-mediated control of reproduction, is only partially understood. Moreover, despite the evidences that the ablation of germ cells extends lifespan ( Hsin and Kenyon, 1999 ) and promotes proteostasis in C. elegans ( Shemesh et al., 2013 ), it is unclear how the aging-regulating mechanisms downstream of the IIS and those that are activated by the reproduction system are linked, and whether post-translational modifications play roles in the orchestration of these mechanisms. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification involving a reversible covalent attachment of a small ubiquitin-like modifier ( SUMO ) to specific lysine residues of proteins ( Melchior, 2000 ). While mammals ubiquitously express three forms of SUMO ( SUMO-1, 2, and 3 ), C. elegans expresses only one SUMO-encoding gene, smo-1 that encodes a polypeptide of 91 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 10. 2 kDa ( Choudhury and Li, 1997 ). SUMOylation controls various biological processes and plays important roles in development and survival ( Johnson, 2004 ). Among other functions, smo-1 is critically needed for germline development and fertility of the nematode ( Broday, 2017 ). Here, we examined whether IIS activity controls SUMOylation of C. elegans\u2019 proteins and if this post-translational modification plays roles in aging-associated functions of this pathway. To address this, we compared global SUMOylation patterns of proteins that were extracted from untreated and from daf-2 RNAi-treated animals, and found that among other modulations, IIS reduction lowers the SUMOylation rate of the protein CAR-1 ( Cytokinesis/Apoptosis/RNA-binding protein 1 ) but has no effect on the expression level of car-1. CAR-1 is an RNA-binding protein, which acts in association with the RNA helicase, CGH-1 in the germline ( Audhya et al., 2005 ). The knockdown of car-1 increases the levels of GLP-1 during late oogenesis ( Noble et al., 2008 ), thereby leading to germ cell death and to defective embryonic cytokinesis ( Boag et al., 2005; Squirrell et al., 2006 ). We show that knocking down car-1 shortens lifespan and enhances proteotoxicity in model worms. On the contrary, the expression of a mutant CAR-1, which cannot be SUMOylated on lysine residue 185 ( K185 ), extends lifespan and promotes proteostasis. These effects are conferred, at least partially, through the GLP-1 axis in a DAF-16-dependent manner, but probably also through an additional, DAF-16-independent pathway. Interestingly, we found that GLP-1 positively controls the expression of car-1 establishing a regulatory circuit. Our findings unveil a novel link between the reproductive system and the IIS, demonstrating that one downstream arm of this pathway regulates certain aspects of aging through the SUMOylation of CAR-1.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Aging may seem inescapable, but there are many factors, from diet to genetic mutations, that can affect this process. In fact, scientists have started to uncover the mechanisms that control and influence this slow decline. For example, in the small worm Caenorhabditis elegans, removing the germs cells \u2013 which give rise to eggs \u2013 extends the lifespan. Similarly, interfering with the activity of the Insulin/IGF-1 signaling ( IIS ) pathway leads to a longer life for the animals. However, it is unclear whether these two mechanisms work together, or if they operate in parallel. To explore this, Moll, Roitenberg et al. first looked at how the IIS pathway regulates a type of protein modification known as SUMOylation in C. elegans. Reducing the activity of the IIS pathway slowed down aging in the worms. It also decreased the levels of SUMOylation of certain proteins, including CAR-1, which is found in the structures that produce germ cells. Further experiments showed that stopping the SUMOylation of CAR-1 extended the lifespan of the animals. In fact, replacing the protein with a mutated version of CAR-1 that cannot accept the SUMO element makes the worms live longer and resist a toxic protein that causes Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans. These results therefore show that, in C. elegans, the IIS pathway and a mechanism that involves CAR-1 in germ cells work together to determine the pace of aging. Further studies are now needed to dissect how the IIS pathway influences SUMOylation, and whether the findings hold true in mammals ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nNonribosomal peptides represent a large class of metabolites with pharmaceutical relevance. Pteridines, such as pterins, folates, and flavins, are heterocyclic metabolites that often serve as redox-active cofactors. The biosynthetic machineries for construction of these distinct classes of small molecules operate independently in the cell. Here, we discovered an unprecedented nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like-pteridine synthase hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster in Photorhabdus luminescens using genome synteny analysis. P. luminescens is a Gammaproteobacterium that undergoes phenotypic variation and can have both pathogenic and mutualistic roles. Through extensive gene deletion, pathway-targeted molecular networking, quantitative proteomic analysis, and NMR, we show that the genetic locus affects the regulation of quorum sensing and secondary metabolic enzymes and encodes new pteridine metabolites functionalized with cis-amide acyl-side chains, termed pepteridine A ( 1 ) and B ( 2 ). The pepteridines are produced in the pathogenic phenotypic variant and represent the first reported metabolites to be synthesized by a hybrid NRPS-pteridine pathway. These studies expand our view of the combinatorial biosynthetic potential available in bacteria.  Nonribosomal peptides are a structurally and functionally privileged class of natural products constructed from a highly diverse pool of potential proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acid building blocks ( Walsh et al., 2013; Walsh, 2016 ). Members of the family include well-known pharmacologically relevant agents, such as vancomycin, daptomycin, penicillin, cyclosprin, and many others. The core catalytic domains of a minimal nonribosomal peptide synthetase ( NRPS ) extender module include condensation ( C ), adenylation ( A ), and peptidyl-carrier protein ( PCP, a. k. a., thiolation, T ) domains. The NRPS first selects its cognate amino acid from the available substrate pool, a step controlled by the selectivity of the A domain, activates it as an aminoacyl adenylate, and subsequently loads it onto the PCP domain. The C domain then typically catalyzes the formation of a trans-amide bond establishing individual peptide backbone linkages through nucleophilic attack of the free amino group present on a downstream aminoacyl-PCP on the upstream peptidyl-PCP. NRPSs can also engage in \u2018hybrid\u2019 pathways to dramatically expand their biocatalytic capabilities. Of\u00a0note\u00a0are the NRPS-polyketide synthase ( PKS ) hybrid pathways, which produce important molecules, including rapamycin, bleomycin, epothilone, colibactin, and\u00a0others. In contrast to the \u2018assembly line\u2019 logic of the majority of NRPSs, pteridines, such as the cofactors biopterin and folate, are derived from guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) ( Brown, 2006 ). Pteridines are composed of fused pyrimidine and pyrazine rings, and natural pteridines are typically functionalized at the C-6 position of the pteridine core ( vide infra ). The electronic properties of this scaffold underlie its role in redox active cofactors critical to a host of metabolic transformations, such as hydroxylation of aromatic compounds and generation of the neurotransmitter nitric oxide ( Groehn et al., 2000 ). Additionally, functionalized pteridines serve as reactants in a number of one-carbon group transfer reactions in metabolism and, more recently, were implicated in catalysis of 1, 3-dipolar cycloaddition-mediated decarboxylation reactions ( Payne et al., 2015; White et al., 2015 ). The\u00a0increase\u00a0in genomic sequence information from diverse microbial sources\u00a0has\u00a0highlighted enormous untapped metabolic potential for discovery of novel nonribosomal peptides and pteridines among other metabolite groups, including groups synthesized by new enzyme classes ( Cimermancic et al., 2014 ). As a result of horizontal gene transfer events during evolution, it is known that the bacterial secondary metabolic pathways encoding many of these metabolites often reside on genomic islands ( Shankar et al., 2006; Penn et al., 2009; Ziemert et al., 2014 ). Genome synteny analyses platforms enable in silico visualization of co-localized genetic loci among phylogenetically\u00a0related organisms and represent general tools to aid in identifying genomic islands. We have previously used genome synteny analysis to aid in identification of \u2018atypical pathways\u2019 and to\u00a0determine the biocatalytic functions of hypothetical proteins located on genomic islands ( Guo and Crawford, 2014; Vizcaino et al., 2014b ). Here, we employ genome synteny analysis to identify a genomic island in the entomopathogen Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 harboring an unprecedented combination of nonribosomal peptide synthetase ( NRPS ) -like and pteridine synthase biosynthetic machineries, suggesting a novel type of hybrid pathway. We demonstrate that this pathway encodes new metabolites dependent on the hybrid enzymatic machinery, the pepteridines. P. luminescens is a Gram-negative Gammaproteobacterium that undergoes stochastic phenotypic variation, and through the use of genetically \u2018locked\u2019 variants ( Somvanshi et al., 2012 ), we show that the pepteridines are produced in a specific variant associated with pathogenesis. Allelic-exchange mutagenesis in P. luminescens and comparative quantitative proteomic analysis further reveal that the genetic locus affects production of several groups of proteins related to the biosynthesis of known quorum sensing and secondary metabolite systems.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Many bacteria produce small molecules that can be used as a basis for developing new drugs. The instructions for the pathways that make these molecules are stored in the genome \u2013 the complete set of genetic material \u2013 of the bacteria. With the advancements in genome sequencing over the last decade, these instructions are becoming much more readily available in sequence databases. \u201cGenome mining\u201d is a strategy that involves searching these databases to identify unknown biochemical pathways and help to characterize them. This strategy could help us to discover many more ecologically and medically relevant molecules. A bacterium called Photorhabdus luminescens produces many antibiotics and other molecules that play a variety of roles in the bacterium\u2019s lifecycle. The bacteria live in the gut of roundworms, and the two species have a mutually beneficial relationship where they help each other to acquire food. However, the bacteria are less friendly to the insects that the roundworms infect. When P. luminescens is released into the body of an insect, it takes on a disease-causing form and releases toxic molecules that kill the insect. Park, Perez et al. have now used genome mining to identify a biochemical pathway in P. luminescens that combines the pathways used to create two different types of small molecules produced by the bacteria. This \u201chybrid\u201d pathway produces a new set of molecules \u2013 called pepteridines \u2013 that are released by the disease-causing form of the bacteria. Park, Perez et al. also identified a regulator protein that controls the hybrid pathway. This regulator is known to help the bacteria to change into the form that kills insects. The pathway also affects the production of proteins known to be involved in \u201cquorum sensing\u201d. In this process, bacteria use a diverse set of chemical signals to report how many other bacteria are nearby, which enables the bacteria to launch coordinated biological responses \u2013 for example, releasing toxic molecules \u2013 when their numbers are great enough. In the future, further experiments will be pursued to rigorously characterize how the components of the new hybrid pathway work together. While the hybrid pathway responsible for the production of the pepteridines serves as one example of the utility of genome mining, there is still much room for further discovery. Applying a similar strategy to different organisms has the potential to uncover other pathways of biomedical relevance ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMany pathogens possess the capacity for sex through outcrossing, despite being able to reproduce also asexually and/or via selfing. Given that sex is assumed to come at a cost, these mixed reproductive strategies typical of pathogens have remained puzzling. While the ecological and evolutionary benefits of outcrossing are theoretically well-supported, support for such benefits in pathogen populations are still scarce. Here, we analyze the epidemiology and genetic structure of natural populations of an obligate fungal pathogen, Podosphaera plantaginis. We find that the opportunities for outcrossing vary spatially. Populations supporting high levels of coinfection \u2013a prerequisite of sex \u2013 result in hotspots of novel genetic diversity. Pathogen populations supporting coinfection also have a higher probability of surviving winter. Jointly our results show that outcrossing has direct epidemiological consequences as well as a major impact on pathogen population genetic diversity, thereby providing evidence of ecological and evolutionary benefits of outcrossing in pathogens.  Many pathogens possess the capacity for sex \u2013 here defined in its broadest sense as the coming together of genes from different individuals ( Lehtonen and Kokko, 2014 ) \u2013 despite being able to reproduce also asexually and/or via selfing. Individuals that undergo sexual reproduction transmit only half their genome per offspring produced in contrast to asexual and selfing individuals ( Lehtonen et al., 2012 ) and hence, understanding the maintenance of sex is one of the fundamental challenges in evolutionary biology. To counteract this two-fold cost of sex, sexual outcrossing is assumed to provide both ecological and evolutionary advantages ( Otto, 2009 ). The Red Queen Hypothesis predicts sexual reproduction to be advantageous in the presence of coevolving parasites, as offspring that are genetically different from their parents should have higher fitness than non-sexual offspring ( Bell, 1982; Hamilton, 1980; Lively, 2010 ). In support of this prediction, empirical studies have demonstrated parasite mediated selection to explain the observed distribution of outcrossing in hosts ( King et al., 2011; Wilson and Sherman, 2013; Lively, 1987 ). Just as sexual reproduction is expected to be selected for in hosts to evade parasitism, parasites should equally be under selection to generate novel genetic variation to infect their ever-changing host populations. Indeed, theoretically it has been possible to identify a parameter space where coevolution with the host favors sexual reproduction in the parasite ( Howard and Lively, 2002; Galvani et al., 2003; Salath\u00e9 et al., 2008 ). However, the empirical evidence for such advantages of sex in parasite populations are still few and conflicting ( Gouyon and de Vienne, 2015 ). Sexual reproduction may also confer ecological advantages by bridging unfavorable seasons or habitats. In free-living facultatively sexual organisms that alternate between asexual and sexual reproduction, the sexual offspring are often the dormant or dispersing life stages ( Stelzer and Lehtonen, 2016; Simon et al., 2002 ). Similarly, in some of the most devastating fungal pathogens of crops, the spores that are produced via outcrossing are also those that are suitable for long-distance dispersal ( Rieux et al., 2014 ), or provide means of surviving unfavorable environmental conditions ( Billiard et al., 2012; Burt, 2000; Saleh et al., 2012 ). While sexual offspring do not contribute to current local population growth, the ability to outcross may be a key determinant of both the numeric and genetic composition of the next season\u2019s epidemic ( Penczykowski et al., 2015; Tack and Laine, 2014 ). For such strategies where outscrossing is timed with low potential asexual growth, for example due to seasonality, the cost of sex is expected to be reduced ( Gerber et al., 2018 ). Homothallic species, where a haploid individual may mate with other haploid individuals of its species, as well as with itself, may be considered a special case of facultative outcrossing. Here, the maintenance of outcrossing is particularly puzzling given that the offspring produced via haploid selfing are expected to yield the same ecological functions as those produced by outcrossing. Nonetheless, there is evidence of high rates of outcrossing in homothallic species ( Billiard et al., 2012 ). To date the relevance of these short-term ecological processes in favoring selfing vs. outcrossing in pathogens populations has remained largely unknown. Even when outcrossing is expected to provide short- or long-term advantages, maintenance of selfing may be favored when mate availability is spatially and/or temporally variable ( Jarne and Charlesworth, 1993 ). For many pathogens, coinfection is the ecological prerequisite of sexual recombination, as outcrossing and hybridization take place during active infection of the same host individual by different strains ( Froissart et al., 2005 ). With molecular tools becoming increasingly available for pathogens, we are beginning to unravel the spatio-temporal distribution of coinfection as well as the ecological outcomes, which may range from facilitation to competition ( Tollenaere et al., 2016 ). Although coinfections have been widely reported for different pathogens, remarkably little is understood of the determinants of coinfection ( Tollenaere et al., 2016 ). Identifying factors that increase the probability of coinfection also shed light on where we expect to see outcrossing in pathogens with mixed mating strategies. Mixed reproductive strategies have been described for a wide range of pathogen species ( Billiard et al., 2012; Billiard et al., 2011 ). However, the sexual stage is methodologically notoriously difficult to study in many pathogens given their microscopic size and the fact that mating types cannot be identified morphologically. Moreover, sexual reproduction may take place inside the host, and may be triggered by specific environmental cues that are difficult to mimic under controlled experimental conditions ( Billiard et al., 2012; Tack and Laine, 2014 ). Hence, remarkably little is understood of this critical life-history stage. To understand why outcrossing is broadly maintained in pathogens despite the costs, here we investigate the ecological and genetic consequences of putative outcrossing in a large natural pathogen metapopulation. Our analysis is based on data collected from Podosphaera plantaginis, a specialist powdery mildew fungus naturally infecting Plantago lanceolata. The visually conspicuous symptoms caused by P. plantaginis enable accurate tracking of infection in the wild. Long-term epidemiological data across approximately 4000 local plant populations in the \u00c5land Islands, southwest of Finland, have demonstrated this pathogen to persist as a highly dynamic metapopulation with frequent extinctions and ( re ) colonizations of local populations ( Jousimo et al., 2014 ). Overwinter survival of local pathogen populations has proven to be the vulnerable life-history stage of P. plantaginis in \u00c5land with a high fraction of the local pathogen populations going extinct ( Jousimo et al., 2014 ). The pathogen survives the winter in resting structures, chasmothecia ( Tack and Laine, 2014 ). These resting structures are produced through sexual reproduction as the hyphal cells of one ( selfing ) or two strains ( outcrossing ) fuse when infecting the same host plant. The resulting diploid zygote undergoes meiotic division to yield haploid ascospores that develop inside the chasmothecium. At the onset of the growing season these chasmothecia rupture, releasing the ascopores that initiate new infections ( Tollenaere and Laine, 2013 ). Here, we ( i ) determine how coinfection - the pre-requisite for sexual outcrossing - varies in natural pathogen populations. We then measure whether ( ii ) putative outcrossing ( i. e. coinfection ) is associated with the generation of novel pathogen multilocus genotypes, and ( iii ) increased pathogen population overwintering success ( Jousimo et al., 2014 ). We\u2019ve surveyed and sampled all found pathogen populations in the \u00c5land Islands for four consecutive years, and we use Spatial Bayesian models ( Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation; INLA; Lindgren and Rue, 2015 ) to analyse data on disease dynamics and genotypic diversity from the natural metapopulation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The existence of sex \u2013 broadly defined as the coming together of genes from different individuals \u2013 is one of the big evolutionary puzzles. Reproduction allows an organism to pass on its genes to future generations. However, while asexual and self-fertilizing individuals transmit all of their genes to their offspring, individuals that reproduce through sex transmit only half of their genome. This is considered the cost of sex. Many pathogens reproduce through sex, despite often also being able to reproduce asexually or by self-fertilization. Typically a pre-requisite of sex in pathogens is for at least two different strains to infect the same host. Aside from this limitation, little is known about when, where and why pathogens have sex. It has been tricky to study due to the microscopic size of pathogens and the difficulties of identifying different sexes. Moreover, sexual reproduction may be triggered by environmental cues that are difficult to mimic under controlled experimental conditions. Are there any benefits associated with pathogen sex ? To find out, Laine et al. analyzed data collected over the course of four years from thousands of populations of a powdery mildew fungus that infected plants across the \u00c5land islands. This revealed that the opportunities for pathogen sex vary in different locations. Areas where multiple strains of the fungus commonly infect the same plants result in hotspots of new genetic diversity. These mixed populations are also more likely to survive winter. This demonstrates the potential for pathogen sexual reproduction to provide an ecological benefit. Identifying areas and populations where pathogens have sex can help to identify when and where new strains are most likely to emerge. In the future, studies that use similar methods to Laine et al. could help to predict where infections and diseases are highly likely to arise ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nIdentification of the host genetic factors that contribute to variation in vaccine responsiveness may uncover important mechanisms affecting vaccine efficacy. We carried out an integrative, longitudinal study combining genetic, transcriptional, and immunologic data in humans given seasonal influenza vaccine. We identified 20 genes exhibiting a transcriptional response to vaccination, significant genotype effects on gene expression, and correlation between the transcriptional and antibody responses. The results show that variation at the level of genes involved in membrane trafficking and antigen processing significantly influences the human response to influenza vaccination. More broadly, we demonstrate that an integrative study design is an efficient alternative to existing methods for the identification of genes involved in complex traits.  Influenza remains one of the major threats to human health worldwide and is responsible for an estimated 250, 000\u2013500, 000 deaths each year ( World Health Organization, 2009 ). Attempts at immunization pre-dated the isolation of the virus from humans in 1933 ( Smith et al., 1933 ) and vaccination remains the cornerstone of prevention strategies. Since 1977, strains of influenza A ( H3N2 ), influenza A ( H1N1 ), and influenza B have been responsible for the majority of documented human infections and trivalent vaccines are updated annually to contain the circulating strains. Animal models have demonstrated that immune responses and susceptibility to influenza infection can be strongly influenced by host genetic factors ( Trammell and Toth, 2008; Srivastava et al., 2009 ). As with viral infection, variability in the immune response to vaccination is likely to be influenced by genotype. Accordingly, twin and sibling studies have shown heritability estimates as high as 45% for a varicella vaccine ( Klein et al., 2007 ) and 90% for a measles vaccine ( Tan et al., 2001 ). Studies investigating influenza vaccine immunogenicity in humans have consistently shown large inter-individual variability, but the genetic contribution to this variability remains poorly understood. Gene expression is strongly controlled by common genetic variants ( Morley et al., 2004; Stranger et al., 2007 ) with both broad ( Bullaughey et al., 2009 ) and tissue-specific effects ( Innocenti et al., 2011; Rotival et al., 2011 ), referred to as expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ). Moreover, genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of variants associated with human disease risk that are also eQTL, implying that the mechanism by which they influence risk involves variation in transcriptional responses ( Emilsson et al., 2008; Cookson et al., 2009; Naukkarinen et al., 2010; Nicolae et al., 2010; Rotival et al., 2011; Barreiro et al., 2012 ) Finally, integrative genomic studies in model organisms ( Schadt et al., 2005; Amit et al., 2009 ) have demonstrated that the combination of genetic and transcriptional information can allow direct tests of causal mechanisms in controlled experiments. We hypothesized that integrating genome-wide genotype data with serial measurements of the transcriptional and humoral responses to an influenza vaccine in a clinical study could be used to identify loci that influence vaccine responsiveness and subsequent immunity to influenza in humans. We immunized an ethnically homogeneous group of 119 healthy adult male volunteers with licensed trivalent influenza vaccine. DNA was obtained from peripheral blood and genome-wide SNP genotyping was performed. We also measured global transcript abundance in peripheral blood RNA specimens before and at three time points ( days 1, 3, and 14 ) after vaccination. Type-specific antibody measurements ( H1N1, H3N2, and FluB ) were made in serum samples before and at two time points ( days 14 and 28 ) after vaccination. An identical study was then carried out with an independent validation cohort of 128 ethnically homogeneous healthy adult female volunteers. This experimental design allowed us to search for loci that show evidence of a transcriptional response to vaccination, genetic regulation of gene expression ( cis-acting eQTL ), and correlation between gene expression and the magnitude of the antibody response.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Vaccines increase resistance to disease by priming the immune system to respond to specific viruses or microorganisms. By presenting a weakened ( or dead ) form of a pathogen, or its toxins or surface proteins, to the immune system, vaccines trigger the production of antibodies against the virus or microorganism. If a vaccinated individual then encounters the pathogen, their immune system should be able to recognize and destroy it. Many vaccines also include a secondary agent, known as an adjuvant, to further stimulate the immune response. Influenza, an RNA virus commonly referred to as the \u2018flu\u2019, is an infectious disease that affects both birds and mammals. Seasonal epidemics occur each year affecting 2\u20137% of the population. According to the World Health Organization, influenza leads to nearly 5 million hospitalizations each year and causes up to half a million deaths. Vaccination is a primary strategy for the prevention of seasonal influenza, but responses to the vaccine vary markedly, partly because of variation in the genetic makeup or genotype of individuals. However, the details of how genes influence response to vaccination, and indeed susceptibility to influenza, remain unclear. To investigate the genetic basis of variation in the immune response of healthy adults to the seasonal influenza vaccine, Franco et al. combined information about the genotypes of individuals with measurements of their gene transcription and antibody response to vaccination. They identified 20 genes that contributed to differential immune responses to the vaccine. Almost half of these encode proteins that are not specifically associated with the immune system, but have more general roles in processes such as membrane trafficking and intracellular transport. Focusing on these genes may enable researchers to spot those individuals who are less likely to respond to a vaccine. It could also open up new avenues of research for vaccine development: rather than designing adjuvants that target known immune mechanisms, researchers should develop adjuvants that target the proteins encoded by these 20 genes ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nHow mammalian tissues maintain their architecture and tissue-specificity is poorly understood. Previously, we documented both the indispensable role of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) protein, laminin-111 ( LN1 ), in the formation of normal breast acini, and the phenotypic reversion of cancer cells to acini-like structures in 3-dimensional ( 3D ) gels with inhibitors of oncogenic pathways. Here, we asked how laminin ( LN ) proteins integrate the signaling pathways necessary for morphogenesis. We report a surprising reciprocal circuitry comprising positive players: laminin-5 ( LN5 ), nitric oxide ( NO ), p53, HOXD10 and three microRNAs ( miRNAs ) \u2014 that are involved in the formation of mammary acini in 3D. Significantly, cancer cells on either 2-dimensional ( 2D ) or 3D and non-malignant cells on 2D plastic do not produce NO and upregulate negative players: NF\u03baB, EIF5A2, SCA1 and MMP-9 \u2014 that disrupt the network. Introducing exogenous NO, LN5 or individual miRNAs to cancer cells reintegrates these pathways and induces phenotypic reversion in 3D. These findings uncover the essential elements of breast epithelial architecture, where the balance between positive- and negative-players leads to homeostasis.  p53 is an extensively characterized regulator of gene expression in the\u00a0context of malignant transformation and is aberrant in almost all cancer types. Many\u00a0p53 studies have been performed in cells cultured in 2D conditions. Despite the extensive\u00a0literature on p53 and its myriad of functions, little is known about what regulates p53 activity in higher organisms in vivo or about\u00a0how p53 might regulate physiological tissue functions in 3D cultures ( Barcellos-Hoff et al., 1989;\u00a0Petersen et al., 1992; Bissell et al., 2005;\u00a0Lee et al., 2007 ). ECM proteins, in particular LNs ( Miner and Yurchenco, 2004 ), compose another important class of regulators that play a role in glandular tissue morphogenesis. Whether or how these two crucial regulators of gene expression intersect in tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis has not been examined. To explore the possibility of such an interaction as an element of tissue-specificity, we utilized the HMT3522 cancer progression series of human mammary epithelial cells ( MECs ) ( Briand et al., 1987;\u00a0Briand et al., 1996; Rizki et al., 2008 ). This unique series comprise both\u00a0primary normal epithelial cells or non-malignant cells ( S1 ) derived from reduction mammoplasty, and their\u00a0malignant counterpart ( T4-2 ), which were derived without external oncogenic agents after prolonged cultivation in defined medium that\u00a0lacked epidermal growth factor ( EGF ), followed by xenografts in animals ( Briand et al., 1987 ). Non-malignant and malignant MECs and\u00a0organoids\u00a0are readily distinguished by their colony structures in 3D\u00a0LN1-rich ECM gels ( lrECM ) ( Petersen et al., 1992 ). Non-malignant mammary\u00a0cells form polarized colonies resembling normal acini of the breast ( Barcellos-Hoff et al., 1989 ), whereas\u00a0malignant cells form disorganized, tumor-like structures ( Petersen et al., 1992; Lee et al., 2007;\u00a0Rizki et al., 2008 ). However, if the\u00a0architecture of colonies is restored in LN1 gels by downmodulating receptors such as integrins and EGFR, or other involved oncogenic pathways to a level found in normal cells, every single malignant cell would form polarized growth-arrested colonies \u2013 by a process we call phenotypic reversion \u2013 through a novel movement we have termed \u2018coherent angular motion\u2019 ( CAMo ) ( Tanner et al., 2012 ). Here, we aimed to delineate core regulators of proper ECM-chromatin communications that establish normal breast acinar architecture, a\u00a0feature\u00a0that is aberrant in cancer cells in 3D. Using S1\u00a0cells, T4-2 cells\u00a0and T4-2 cells reverted to \u2018normal\u2019 phenotype ( T4-2 Rev ) by five different signaling inhibitors, we identified a subset of 60 genes that had similar expression patterns in\u00a0S1 and in\u00a0all of\u00a0the T4-2\u00a0Rev cells ( Bissell et al., 2005; Becker-Weimann et al., 2013 ), as well as 10 miRNAs that could potentially target these 60 genes. Among\u00a0the 10 miRNAs, we specifically focused on miR-34c-5p, \u221230e, and \u2212144, which are dramatically downmodulated in\u00a0many breast tumors ( Lu et al., 2005 ). Restoration of the miRNA caused phenotypic reversion of T4-2 cells in lrECM. While studying the signaling cascades that involve these three miRNAs, we identified a reciprocal regulatory network\u00a0\u2013 comprising LN1\u00a0and\u00a0LN5, NO, p53, HOXD10, NF\u03baB, the three miRNAs, EIF5A2, SCA1, and\u00a0MMP-9\u00a0\u2013 which connects the ECM-laminins and the nuclear transcription factors ( TFs ), most possibly via a newly discovered nuclear tunnel ( Jorgens et al., 2017 ), to execute breast morphogenetic programs. Our results shed light on a completely novel and intricate reciprocal loop for breast acinar morphogenesis through a reiterative activation and suppression of regulatory molecules necessary to maintain the differentiated state in 3D and to prevent malignant conversion.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Most animal cells can secrete molecules into their surroundings to form a supportive meshwork of large proteins, called the extracellular matrix. This matrix is connected to the cell membrane through receptors that can transmit signals to the cell nucleus to change the levels of small RNA molecules called microRNAs. These, in turn, can switch genes on and off in the nucleus. In the laboratory, cells that build breast tissue and glands can be grown in gels containing extracellular matrix proteins called laminins. Under these conditions, \u2018normal\u2019 cells form organized clusters that resemble breast glands. However, if the communication between healthy cells and the extracellular matrix is interrupted, the cells can become disorganized and start to form clumps that resemble tumors, and if injected into mice, can form tumors. Conversely, if the interaction between the extracellular matrix and the cells is restored, each single cancer cell can \u2013 despite mutations \u2013 be turned into a healthy-looking cell. These cells form a normal-looking tissue through a process called reversion. Until now, it was not known which signals help normal breast tissue to form, and how cancerous cells revert into a \u2018normal\u2019 shape. To investigate this, Furuta et al. used a unique series of breast cells from a woman who underwent breast reduction. The cells taken from the discarded tissue had been previously grown by a different group of researchers in a specific way to ensure that both normal and eventual cancer cells were from the same individual. Furuta et al. then put these cells in the type of laminin found in extracellular matrix. The other set of cells used consisted of the same cancerous cells that had been reverted to normal-looking cells. Analysis of the three cell sets identified 60 genes that were turned down in reverted cancer cells to a level found in healthy cells, as well as 10 microRNAs that potentially target these 60 genes. A database search suggested that three of these microRNAs, which are absent in cancer cells, are necessary for healthy breast cells to form organized structures. Using this as a starting point, Furuta et al. discovered a signaling loop that was previously unknown and that organizes breast cells into healthy looking tissue. This showed that laminins help to produce nitric oxide, an important signaling molecule that activates several specific proteins inside the breast cells and restores the levels of the three microRNAs. These, in turn, switch off two genes that are responsible for activating an enzyme that can chop the laminins. Since the two genes are deactivated in the reverted cancer cells, the laminins remain intact and the cells can form organized structures. These findings suggest that if any of the components of the loop were missing, the cells would start to form cancerous clumps again. Reverting the cancer cells in the presence of laminins, however, could help cancer cells to form \u2018normal\u2019 structures again. These findings shed new light on how the extracellular matrix communicates with proteins in the nucleus to influence how single cells form breast tissues. It also shows that laminins are crucial for generating signals that regulate both form and function of specific tissues. A better understanding of how healthy and cancerous tissues form and re-form may in the future help to develop new cancer treatments ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nStress is known to exert its detrimental effects not only by enhancing fear, but also by impairing its extinction. However, in earlier studies stress exposure preceded both processes. Thus, compared to unstressed animals, stressed animals had to extinguish fear memories that were strengthened by prior exposure to stress. Here, we dissociate the two processes to examine if stress specifically impairs the acquisition and recall of fear extinction. Strikingly, when fear memories were formed before stress exposure, thereby allowing animals to initiate extinction from comparable levels of fear, recall of fear extinction was unaffected. Despite this, we observed a persistent increase in theta activity in the BLA. Theta activity in the mPFC, by contrast, was normal. Stress also disrupted mPFC-BLA theta-frequency synchrony and directional coupling. Thus, in the absence of the fear-enhancing effects of stress, the expression of fear during and after extinction reflects normal regulation of theta activity in the mPFC, not theta hyperactivity in the amygdala.  Accumulating evidence from animal models shows that stress elicits divergent patterns of plasticity across brain regions ( Chattarji et al., 2015 ). For instance, repeated stress causes loss of dendrites and spines in the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) ( Shansky and Morrison, 2009 ). In the basolateral amygdala ( BLA ), by contrast, chronic stress strengthens the structural basis of synaptic connectivity through dendritic growth and spinogenesis ( Chattarji et al., 2015 ). Physiological and molecular measures of synaptic plasticity also exhibit these contrasting features. As useful as these studies have been in examining the effects of stress across biological scales, much of this evidence was gathered from postmortem analyses ( Chattarji et al., 2015 ). Less is known about how stress affects neural activity in the intact brain of behaving animals. Further, in many of these studies, stress-induced plasticity was viewed as stand-alone effects intrinsic to individual brain areas, despite extensive interconnections between them. Indeed, interactions between these brain areas together give rise to behaviors that are affected by stress ( Quirk and Mueller, 2008 ). One such behavior involves the expression of fear memories, various facets of which depend on both the BLA and mPFC ( Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011 ). Repeated stress has been shown to enhance fear memories, as well as impair their extinction ( Miracle et al., 2006; Suvrathan et al., 2014 ). These studies, however, first exposed animals to stress, and then subjected them to fear conditioning followed by extinction ( Izquierdo et al., 2006; Miracle et al., 2006 ). In other words, these studies analyzed the impact of stress on both the formation and extinction of fear memories, not the latter alone. This experimental design has led to two broad classes of findings. In a majority of these studies, stress did not necessarily lead to higher freezing levels during fear recall. Even though expression of fear was not elevated by prior exposure to stress, it was resistant to subsequent extinction in stressed animals ( Noble et al., 2017; Zhang and Rosenkranz, 2013 ). In a few studies, however, the behavioral data suggest that prior exposure to stress may have also led to stronger fear memories manifested as higher levels of freezing in stressed animals at the beginning of extinction training ( Chauveau et al., 2012; Hoffman et al., 2014; Miracle et al., 2006 ). This too could have contributed to the subsequent deficit in fear extinction recall. An alternative strategy to test if stress impairs the extinction of fear memories would be for animals to form fear memories before stress exposure, thereby dissociating the effects of stress on acquisition versus extinction of conditioned fear. This would offer an opportunity to examine how stress specifically affects expression of fear during and after extinction, without the confounds of stronger fear memories caused by prior exposure to stress. Hence, the present study combines simultaneous behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological analyses to address this question.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Patients with stress-related psychiatric disorders experience debilitating emotional symptoms, including excessive fear that they are unable to control. Decades of research have shown that such disorders have opposite effects on two key structures in the brain. Normally, a region called the amygdala helps to form fear-related memories, while the prefrontal cortex helps control these memories and eliminate them through a process called extinction. But brain imaging on patients with stress-related psychiatric disorders reveals a smaller prefrontal cortex, and an overactive amygdala. Animal studies confirm that chronic stress shrinks brain cells in the prefrontal cortex, but grows them bigger in the amygdala. These and other studies have led scientists to believe that stress causes people to both form stronger fear memories and then have difficulties getting rid of such memories. These include studies in which stressed animals were trained to fear a sound, and then followed while they learned to overcome that fear. One problem with many of these studies is that the animals were repeatedly stressed before the fear memory was formed. This made it hard to tease apart whether the strength of the fear memory itself or a problem extinguishing the fear memory were to blame for the animals\u2019 difficulties overcoming their fear. Now, Rahman et al. address this problem by exploring how the timing of chronic stress affects how well an animal can overcome fear memories. In the experiments, some rats learned to fear a sound before exposure to chronic stress, while a second group was exposed to chronic stress first then learned to fear the sound. When the animals were stressed after they learned to fear the sound, they could still eliminate their fear. But the animals stressed before exposure to the fear-inducing sound struggled to extinguish the fear. Recordings of the brain activity in the rats that were exposed to stress after learning to fear the sound showed the amygdala remained overly active even after these animals overcame their fear. However, the stress did not seem to disrupt the normal activity of the prefrontal cortex in these rats. This shows that memories formed before stress reflect normal activity in the prefrontal cortex and not the abnormally high activity in the amygdala. Exposure therapy helps people overcome stress-disorder related fears. For the therapy to work, the prefrontal cortex must be able to extinguish fear. Rahman et al. show that this is possible when the fear-enhancing effects of prior stress are not in play. More studies exploring why prior stress makes fears stronger and harder to overcome may help scientists develop ways to make therapies for stress disorders more effective ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nEpithelial cells and their underlying basement membranes ( BMs ) slide along each other to renew epithelia, shape organs, and enlarge BM openings. How BM sliding is controlled, however, is poorly understood. Using genetic and live cell imaging approaches during uterine-vulval attachment in C. elegans, we have discovered that the invasive uterine anchor cell activates Notch signaling in neighboring uterine cells at the boundary of the BM gap through which it invades to promote BM sliding. Through an RNAi screen, we found that Notch activation upregulates expression of ctg-1, which encodes a Sec14-GOLD protein, a member of the Sec14 phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein superfamily that is implicated in vesicle trafficking. Through photobleaching, targeted knockdown, and cell-specific rescue, our results suggest that CTG-1 restricts BM adhesion receptor DGN-1 ( dystroglycan ) trafficking to the cell-BM interface, which promotes BM sliding. Together, these studies reveal a new morphogenetic signaling pathway that controls BM sliding to remodel tissues.  The basement membrane ( BM ) is a cell-associated, dense, sheet-like form of extracellular matrix that underlies all epithelia and endothelial tissue, and surrounds muscle, fat, and Schwann cells ( Halfter et al., 2015; Yurchenco, 2011 ). BMs are built on polymeric laminin and type IV collagen networks that arose at the time of animal multicellularity, and may have been required for the evolution of complex tissues ( Hynes, 2012; Ozbek et al., 2010 ). Consistent with this idea, BMs provide tissues with mechanical support, barrier functions, and cues for polarization, differentiation and growth ( Breitkreutz et al., 2013; Hay, 1981; Poschl et al., 2004; Rasmussen et al., 2012; Suh and Miner, 2013; Yurchenco, 2011 ). Although it was generally thought that cell-BM interactions are static, live imaging studies have revealed that cell-BM interfaces are highly dynamic ( Morrissey and Sherwood, 2015 ). One of the most dramatic examples of this mobility is cell-BM sliding, during which epithelial cell layers and their underlying BM sheets move ( slide ) along one another independently to regulate tissue remodeling or renewal. Examples of cell-BM sliding are varied and include egg chamber rotation in Drosophila, where the follicle cells move along BM and deposit constricting strips of aligned type IV collagen, which direct egg elongation along the anterior-posterior axis ( Cetera and Horne-Badovinac, 2015; Haigo and Bilder, 2011 ). During salivary gland growth in vertebrates, the BM slides away from the bud tip toward the duct, allowing bud expansion while restricting growth at the duct ( Harunaga et al., 2014 ). Further, BM labeling and pulse chase experiments revealed that intestinal epithelial cells derived from the stem cell crypt slide along the BM towards the villus tips during differentiation to rapidly renew the gut epithelium ( Clevers, 2013; Trier et al., 1990 ). Cell-BM sliding may be a common morphogenetic process that regulates organ shaping during development, tissue homeostasis, and diseases such as cancer, where remodeling of cell-BM interfaces frequently occur ( Kelley et al., 2014; Rowe and Weiss, 2008 ). Because of the challenge of visualizing and experimentally examining dynamic cell-BM interactions in vivo, however, mechanisms controlling cell-BM sliding remain largely unknown. An experimentally tractable model to examine cell-BM sliding during tissue remodeling is uterine-vulval attachment in C. elegans ( Schindler and Sherwood, 2013 ), a developmental process that is necessary for effective mating and egg laying in the worm. During the mid-L3 larval stage, the uterine-vulval connection is initiated by a specialized uterine cell, the anchor cell ( AC ), that breaches the BM that separate these tissues and attaches to the underlying vulval cells. Following AC invasion, the gap in the BM widens further, which allows additional connection between uterine and vulval cells ( Ihara et al., 2011 ). BM gap widening does not involve BM degradation. Instead, optical highlighting of BM and manipulation of tissue dynamics has shown that growth and morphogenesis of the uterine and vulval tissues generate forces on the BM that drive BM sliding over the vulval and uterine cells to further expand the gap ( Ihara et al., 2011 ). The vulval cells have a key role in controlling the extent of BM movement. The centrally located vulval E and F cells, which contact the BM gap boundary, undergo precisely timed divisions to initiate BM sliding--cell rounding during divisions dramatically reduces cell contact with the BM and allows the BM to slide over the vulE and F cells ( Matus et al., 2014 ). The BM stops sliding on the non-dividing vulD cell, which concentrates the BM adhesion receptor INA-1/PAT-3 ( integrin ) to stabilize the BM gap boundary ( Ihara et al., 2011; Matus et al., 2014 ). While vulval cell divisions control BM sliding on the vulval side of the uterine-vulval connection, the role of the uterine \u03c0 cells, which flank the AC, and sit on the opposing side of the BM gap boundary, remain unclear. Many receptors bind BM components and are possible regulators of BM sliding. Two of the most prominent classes of adhesion receptors that link BM to the cytoskeleton are integrin family members and the receptor dystroglycan ( Bello et al., 2015; Kramer, 2005; Yurchenco, 2011 ). Most studies have focused on how these receptors are activated or upregulated to strengthen adhesion; however there is a growing appreciation of the importance of integrin and dystroglycan downregulation in morphogenetic, homeostatic, and disease processes ( Agrawal et al., 2006; Bouvard et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2015; Nakaya et al., 2013 ). Cells utilize a variety of mechanisms to reduce BM receptor adhesion. These include transcriptional downregulation, production of negative regulators that interfere with receptor activation, alterations in phosphorylation status, and changes in localization and trafficking ( Bouvard et al., 2013; Nakaya et al., 2013; Poulton and Deng, 2006 ). Whether these strategies are used to modulate adhesion to control BM sliding is unknown. To address how the uterine BM gap boundary cells control BM sliding during uterine-vulval attachment in C. elegans, we carried out a mutagenesis screen. Through this screen we identified a putative null mutant in the gene encoding the LIN-29 protein, which is a Kruppel-family EGR ( early growth response ) protein ( Harris and Horvitz, 2011 ), that is deficient in BM sliding. We show that LIN-29 is expressed and functions in the invading AC to promote BM sliding. We further find that LIN-29 regulates BM sliding through its role in maintaining AC expression of LAG-2, a transmembrane Notch ligand, which activates Notch signaling in the neighboring BM gap boundary cells, the uterine \u03c0 cells that sit on BM next to the nascent breach. Through a targeted uterine-specific RNAi screen of putative direct Notch targets, we find that Notch activation in these uterine cells upregulates ctg-1 expression, which encodes a Sec14-GOLD domain phosphatidylinositol transfer protein that belongs to a class of proteins implicated in regulating vesicle trafficking ( Grabon et al., 2015 ). Finally, using photobleaching, CRISPR/Cas-9 targeted knockout, and cell-specific rescue experiments, we demonstrate that CTG-1 functions in the uterine \u03c0 cells to limit the cell surface trafficking of DGN-1 ( dystroglycan ), and that reduction of DGN-1 is sufficient to promote BM sliding. Together these studies identify a new morphogenetic pathway\u2014from signaling mechanism to effector\u2014that promotes BM sliding, which can be used by invasive cells to enlarge BM openings and allow the direct interaction of cells between tissues.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: All tissues in the human body are encased with a thin, dense, web of proteins called the basement membrane. These membranes separate and help shape tissues, while protecting them from mechanical damage such as stretching. However, despite serving as important barriers, basement membranes must be rapidly removed at specific times and places to allow tissues to grow and change shape. This process also permits cells to enter and leave tissues, such as immune cells when they search for disease-producing agents. This creates a paradox: how does a tissue create a tough, impassable barrier that can also be rapidly removed at specific times and places ? Recent research has shown that basement membranes can slide over a tissue, and thus rapidly move the barriers to create openings for tissue growth and reshaping. However, it was not known how the cells within tissues that are normally firmly attached to basement membrane control when and where basement membrane can slide. Now, McClatchey, Wang et al. have carefully observed the tissues and basement membranes in a small worm called Caenorhabditis elegans under a microscope. This revealed that a single cell, called the anchor cell, relays a signal that instructs a group of neighboring cells to let go of the basement membrane at a specific time to allow tissue reshaping. Further experiments revealed that this signal causes cells to reduce the amount of a protein named dystroglycan at their surface. Dystroglycan is present in most tissues and helps stick the cells of tissues to basement membranes. The loss of dystroglycan was previously reported to promote the spread of cancer, although its role in cancer progression was not clear. The findings of McClatchey, Wang et al. now suggest that tumors that lose dystroglycan might allow the basement membranes surrounding them to slide, creating openings that allow the cancers to spread. Finally, McClatchey, Wang et al. also found that a protein named CTG-1, one of a family of proteins thought to regulate the movement of proteins within cells, restricts the levels of dystroglycan at cell surface. As such, the next challenge will be to understand exactly how CTG-1 limits the amount of dystroglycan at the cell surface ."}

Direct dating of Homo naledi fossils from the Dinaledi Chamber ( Berger et al., 2015 ) shows that they were deposited between about 236 ka and 335 ka ( Dirks et al., 2017 ), placing H. naledi in the later Middle Pleistocene. Hawks and colleagues ( Hawks et al., 2017 ) report the discovery of a second chamber within the Rising Star system ( Dirks et al., 2015 ) that contains H. naledi remains. Previously, only large-brained modern humans or their close relatives had been demonstrated to exist at this late time in Africa, but the fossil evidence for any hominins in subequatorial Africa was very sparse. It is now evident that a diversity of hominin lineages existed in this region, with some divergent lineages contributing DNA to living humans and at least H. naledi representing a survivor from the earliest stages of diversification within Homo. The existence of a diverse array of hominins in subequatorial comports with our present knowledge of diversity across other savanna-adapted species, as well as with palaeoclimate and paleoenvironmental data. H. naledi casts the fossil and archaeological records into a new light, as we cannot exclude that this lineage was responsible for the production of Acheulean or Middle Stone Age tool industries.  Geological evidence from the Dinaledi Chamber, including direct dating of the fossil hominin remains, places H. naledi in the later Middle Pleistocene. All considerations of the phylogenetic placement of H. naledi to\u00a0date agree that its branch on the hominin phylogeny must have originated earlier than 900 ka ( Dembo et al., 2016 ), and earlier branch points are credible ( Berger et al., 2015; Dembo et al., 2016; Thackeray, 2015 ). If H. naledi stems from a basal node within Homo, a\u00a0scenario\u00a0that is not rejected by phylogenetic analyses ( Dembo et al., 2016; Hawks and Berger, 2016 ), its branch may have originated much earlier, in the Pliocene. How did this H. naledi lineage fit into the hominin diversity of the Early and Middle Pleistocene, and is it possible that palaeoanthropologists may already have discovered\u2014but not recognized\u2014other fossils that represent this branch ? The hominin fossil record of the African Middle Pleistocene is extremely sparse ( Klein, 1973; Berger and Parkington, 1995; Gr\u00fcn et al., 1996; Stynder et al., 2001; Marean and Assefa, 2005; Klein et al., 2007a; Millard, 2008; Stringer, 2011; Wood, 2011; Smith et al., 2015 ). Fossils that putatively derive from this period between 780, 000 and 130, 000 years ago are limited and typically fragmentary ( Table 1; Figure 1 ). Only a small number are thought to come from the period before 200, 000 years ago. To this number, it is possible to add perhaps a half dozen partial mandibles and a somewhat greater number of postcranial fragments or dental remains. Many of these were found prior to 1960 and lack adequate provenience. Some have been \u2018dated\u2019 mainly by their morphological appearance, or by examination of vertebrate faunal remains that were not excavated together in association with the hominin specimen. Others have been subject to direct dating, but this\u00a0has\u00a0often been\u00a0reported in ways that do not reflect the full statistical uncertainty ( Millard, 2008 ). Among these finds, crania have been considered the most diagnostically important as indicators of the presence of archaic humans with large brain sizes in the Middle and Late Middle Pleistocene. 10. 7554/eLife. 24234. 003Figure 1.

We report here the widest range as reviewed by Mcbrearty and Brooks ( 2000 ), based on the paleomagnetic sequence. Only three of the fossil crania occur within 3, 000 km of the location of the Rising Star cave system. The cranium and mandible fragment from Elandsfontein, or Saldanha, South Africa derives from an open-air deposit with multiple depositions of faunal remains, which, by comparison with East African vertebrate assemblages, come from about 600, 000 to 1 million years ago ( Klein et al., 2007a ). However, the skull and mandible fragment are essentially surface finds. The Florisbad partial cranium from near Bloemfontein, South Africa, comes from mineral springs which accumulated fossils from around 40 ka to 400 ka; a direct electron spin resonance ( ESR ) assessment on a human M3 yielded an age estimate of 259\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035 ka ( Gr\u00fcn et al., 1996 ). This single tooth is assumed to be associated with the fossil hominin cranium. It is roughly 1 mm smaller in diameter than a sample of four H. naledi upper third molars, and lies within the size range of both\u00a0H. erectus and African modern human populations ( Smith et al., 2015 ). Although third molars vary substantially in humans and fossil Homo, this tooth does not resemble the morphology of known H. naledi maxillary third molars. The Kabwe, or Broken Hill, cranium from Zambia has no direct geological age assessment and its context is very poorly known. The vertebrate fauna in the cave sediments where the skull presumably originated is Middle Pleistocene in age ( Klein, 1973; Millard, 2008 ), although the context of the skull in relation to these faunal remains is not clear. Observing that the morphology of the skull is primitive compared to those\u00a0of\u00a0crania from early Late Pleistocene contexts, some workers have argued that the Kabwe skull may be 300 ka or earlier ( Br\u00e4uer, 2008 ), though more recent work suggests it may be of later middle Pleistocene age ( Stringer, 2011 ). The Lake Ndutu cranium is the only other subequatorial cranial specimen thought to be between 780, 000 and 200, 000 years old, but it also lacks secure provenience or a\u00a0direct geological age estimate. Teeth from Hoedjiespunt ( Berger and Parkington, 1995; Stynder et al., 2001 ) and the mandible from Cave of Hearths, South Africa, also provide evidence of hominins, probably of Middle Pleistocene age, but without further comparisons we cannot rule out the\u00a0possibility\u00a0that these fossils may themselves represent H. naledi. All of the cranial fossils discussed above\u00a0share substantially larger brain size than H. naledi but are morphologically diverse in comparison to each other. The uncertain provenience and inexact geological ages of these fossils limit our ability to test when and where the populations that they represent may have existed, and it is conceivable that some of the remains are not Middle Pleistocene at all. In addition to the crania, a few postcranial specimens document individuals with a larger body size than has yet been observed for H. naledi. The Kabwe hominin collection includes several postcranial elements, which are not associated with certainty with the cranium, but that\u00a0clearly represent individuals with a large body size. Also within the 3, 000 km radius are a large femur from Berg Aukas, Namibia ( Grine et al., 1995 ), presumed to be of Middle Pleistocene age, and a large tibia from Hoedjiespunt, South Africa ( Berger and Parkington, 1995; Stynder et al., 2001; Churchill et al., 2000 ) that is Middle Pleistocene in age. Earlier than these Middle Pleistocene fossil specimens, the sites of Olorgesailie and Olduvai Gorge both preserve evidence of hominin crania ( KNM-OL 45500, OH 12 ), which although fragmentary, clearly belonged to individuals that\u00a0had relatively small brain sizes comparable to some of the earliest H. erectus remains ( Potts et al., 2004; Ant\u00f3n, 2004 ). These have been called \u2018H. erectus-like\u2019, but they are different from contemporary fossil specimens attributed to H. erectus from further to the north, such as BOU-VP-2/66 calvaria from Daka, Ethiopia ( Asfaw et al., 2002; Gilbert et al., 2003 ), and the UA 31 cranium from Buia, Eritrea ( Abbate et al., 1998 ), both approximately 1 million years old. KNM-OL 45500 and OH 12 also differ from\u00a0the large and robust OH 9 cranium, which is likewise from Olduvai Gorge but earlier in time. The fossil sites from Lake Baringo southward to Olduvai Gorge lie at the hinge point separating subequatorial from northeast African populations of many living species of mammals. It is possible that fossils such as KNM-OL 45500, OH 12 and OH 28 represent northern excursions of a more diverse subequatorial hominin community that included H. naledi and its relatives. The great tropical forests of Africa pose a biogeographic barrier to species that are adapted to savanna and savanna-woodland-mosaic habitats. During the Pleistocene, these tropical forests repeatedly\u00a0expanded eastward along the equator. During these times, Equatorial East Africa broke into a mosaic of small savanna remnants, while a large and contiguous area of savanna and savanna-woodland mosaic stretched southward from the equatorial forest ( Lorenzen et al., 2012; Faith et al., 2016 ). During most of the Pleistocene, the area suitable for hominins located\u00a0to the south of the equatorial forests was\u00a0vastly larger\u00a0than that\u00a0to the north or east. During the last 1. 3 million years of this period, the Lake Malawi basin became increasingly moist with greater climate stability ( Johnson et al., 2016 ). The paleoclimate record for the Kalahari is not as deep, but during the last 200, 000 years, this area underwent both arid periods with dune formation and wetter periods with vast paleolakes ( Robbins et al., 2016 ), a pattern that likely held during earlier climate cycles. Hence the subequatorial area that\u00a0was\u00a0potentially suitable for hominins varied extensively, but may have been 5\u201315 times larger than the equivalent habitats in eastern Africa north of the equator. This biogeographic history is reflected in the phylogeography of savanna-adapted species today. Across several orders of savanna-adapted mammals, including ungulates, primates, and carnivores, a north\u2013south dichotomy can be observed in genetic patterning ( Bertola et al., 2016 ), and this is thought to be the result of past climate patterns. A comparison of 19 ungulate species shows that many have a \u2018suture zone\u2019 in the East African equatorial region, where relatively distinct mtDNA clades from eastern and southern parts of the species\u2019 range meet ( Lorenzen et al., 2012 ). In several species of ungulates, primates, and carnivores, today\u2019s East African populations were colonized from the large and more contiguous region to the south; in some other\u00a0species, East African diversity has been maintained through vicariance of populations in mosaic refugia within East Africa. A southern African origin is also inferred for baboons ( Papio ). Likemany savanna ungulates this\u00a0genus\u00a0manifests an mtDNA suture zone in equatorial East Africa, which\u00a0has\u00a0recently been\u00a0expanded by introgressive hybridization of a more southern mtDNA clade into P. cynocephalus ( Zinner et al., 2013 ). Similar to many other mammals in Africa, living humans carry a genetic legacy of greater subequatorial African diversity. Today, the human populations that\u00a0have the highest observed genetic diversity are the hunter-gatherers of southwestern Africa, followed by the Mbuti rainforest hunter-gatherers of north eastern Congo ( Mallick et al., 2016 ). Hadza and Sandawe people from Tanzania also draw ancestry from a diverse source population similar to today\u2019s southwestern African hunter-gatherers ( Pickrell et al., 2014 ). Today\u2019s populations are descendants of human populations that have been relatively large and stable across most of the past 200, 000 years. These\u00a0populations\u00a0did not undergo the population bottleneck evidenced in non-African populations and to a lesser degree in West African and northeastern African peoples ( Mallick et al., 2016 ). Additionally, the genomes of\u00a0Hadza, Sandawe, Biaka, Baka, and San people bear evidence of a small fraction of introgression from highly genetically divergent populations that no longer exist ( Hammer et al., 2011; Lachance et al., 2012; Beltrame et al., 2016; Hsieh et al., 2016 ). The implication of these observations is that tropical and subequatorial Africa were home to multiple genetically divergent populations of hominins. Some of these populations diverged in the Early Pleistocene, and\u00a0had genomes that\u00a0were\u00a0equally or more diverse than those of Neanderthals, Denisovans, or contemporary modern humans. Some of these populations survived and hybridized after the initial diversification of modern humans, perhaps as recently as 35, 000 years ago ( Hammer et al., 2011 ) or even into the early Holocene ( Hsieh et al., 2016 ). As other have noted ( Stringer, 2016 ), the fossil hominin record of the Middle and Late Pleistocene shows no simple linear progression towards modern humans, and different morphological forms overlapped in time. A small-brained hominin has been recognized from this time period in Asia on the island of Flores ( Brown et al., 2004 ), and\u00a0we now include a small-brained species of hominin from Africa in this recognized diversity. Modern H. sapiens is a phylogenetic relict. In biology, a relict is a species that remains from a clade that was more diverse in the past ( Grandcolas and Trewick, 2016 ). We have known for a long time that other hominin populations once inhabited Eurasia and island Southeast Asia, including the Neanderthals, Denisovans, and H. floresiensis ( Bocquet-Appel and Demars, 2000; Brown et al., 2004; Cooper and Stringer, 2013; Li et al., 2017 ). Genetic evidence shows that equally diverse populations of archaic humans once existed in subequatorial Africa ( Hammer et al., 2011; Stringer, 2011; Lachance et al., 2012 ), and although no fossil evidence can yet be associated with such evidence of genetic introgression, the Middle Pleistocene record of this region does speak to the presence of morphological diversity. Within this context, H. naledi provides fossil evidence of one subequatorial lineage, and we do not yet know whether it contributed to the modern human gene pool. Another implication of modern humans as a relict is that the features of today\u2019s humans give a biased and incomplete picture of the diversity of the Homo clade ( cf. Grandcolas et al., 2014 ). These biases have had enormous consequences for the historical development of paleoanthropology. One of the most persistent biases has been to conceive of postcranial and dental adaptations of Homo as mere adjuncts to the extraordinary increase in brain size evidenced in living humans. Poor fossil evidence once appeared to support the notion that human-like aspects of locomotor, manipulatory, and dietary strategy evolved in tandem with larger brains, and that H. erectus combined these for the first time ( Wood and Collard, 1999; Hawks et al., 2000 ). But newer evidence shows that some fossils attributed to H. erectus had a mosaic of human-like and primitive postcranial features ( Lordkipanidze et al., 2007 ), that some fossil samples of H. erectus had brain sizes equivalent to those\u00a0of\u00a0H. habilis and H. rudolfensis ( Lordkipanidze et al., 2013 ), and that H. habilis may be closer to Au. sediba than to other species of Homo ( Dembo et al., 2015, 2016 ). H. naledi shows that many human-like anatomical aspects of the hand, foot, lower limb, dentition and cranium, including some aspects that are not present in H. erectus, occurred in a species with a brain size equal to that of australopiths ( Berger et al., 2015 ). The full geographic extent of H. naledi is unknown, though aspects of its anatomy might be used to argue that\u00a0this\u00a0species is unlikely to be endemic only to the region where its fossils are presently found. With its human-like pattern of lower limb and foot anatomy ( Harcourt-Smith et al., 2015; Marchi et al., 2017 ), human-like stature ( Berger et al., 2015 ), and dental morphology consistent with reliance on a high-quality diet ( Berger et al., 2015 ), H. naledi appears to have used its environment in a similar way to H. erectus and H. sapiens. Indeed, even earlier small-bodied Australopithecus and Paranthropus have been inferred to be eurytopic, capable of using a wide range of habitats, and all well-sampled species are geographically widespread ( Wood and Strait, 2004; Behrensmeyer and Reed, 2013 ). Aside from these considerations, the hominin fossil sample is insufficient to support further conclusions about the geographic range of H. naledi. The late survival of H. naledi from origins deep in the Pleistocene up to the Dinaledi and Lesedi Chamber deposits is surprisingly unhelpful in testing hypotheses about its evolutionary origin or its morphological pattern. How the traits of H. naledi evolved does not depend on the geological age of the Dinaledi Chamber fossils, but on the phylogenetic position of H. naledi and the morphological patterns of other hominin taxa. Phylogenetic scenarios for H. naledi place its origin either: ( 1 ) somewhere among the poorly\u00a0resolved branches leading to H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, H. floresiensis and Au. sediba ( Berger et al., 2015; Dembo et al., 2016 ) ; Thackeray, 2015 ) : ( 2 ) as a sister to H. erectus and larger-brained Homo including H. sapiens ( Dembo et al., 2016 ) ; or ( 3 ) as a sister to a clade including H. sapiens, H. antecessor, and other archaic humans ( Dembo et al., 2016 ) ( Figure 2 ). Maximum parsimony analysis of a large dataset of cranial and dental traits supports scenario 1, placing H. naledi among the most basal nodes of the Homo phylogeny ( Dembo et al., 2016 ). Bayesian analysis of the same dataset supports scenario 3, placing H. naledi closer to modern humans than any H. erectus sample ( Dembo et al., 2016 ). An informal consideration of postcranial traits suggests that Dembo et al. ( 2016 ) analysis, if it included postcrania, might more likely support scenario 2. This\u00a0is\u00a0because H. naledi shares many derived features of the hand, foot, and lower limb with H. erectus and H. sapiens that are apparently absent from H. habilis, H. floresiensis, or Au. sediba, yet lacks several derived traits of the shoulder, trunk, and hip shared by H. erectus and H. sapiens ( Hawks et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2017; Marchi et al., 2017; Feuerriegel et al., 2017 ). However, the fossil record for these areas of anatomy in early hominins other than H. naledi is admittedly limited. 10. 7554/eLife. 24234. 005Figure 2. Phylogenetic scenarios for H. naledi. A simplified cladogram of Homo, with the\u00a0possible placements of H. naledi indicated. The cladogram places A. africanus as an outgroup to the Homo + Au. sediba clade, as consistent with nearly all phylogenetic analyses of these species ( Berger et al., 2010; Dembo et al., 2015, 2016 ). To simplify the tree, we have omitted H. antecessor, H. heidelbergensis and Neanderthals, which all phylogenetic analyses place\u00a0as sisters to H. sapiens relative to H. erectus. There is no present consensus about the branching order among H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, H. floresiensis and Au. sediba ( Dembo et al., 2015, 2016 ), and so these are depicted as a polytomy. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 24234. 005 No interpretation of this anatomy can eliminate the necessity of some reversals or parallelism. If H. naledi is a sister to H. sapiens ( scenario 3 ), then all of\u00a0the primitive traits it does not share with H. erectus, including its small brain size ( Berger et al., 2015 ), shoulder morphology ( Feuerriegel et al., 2017 ), ilium form ( VanSickle et al., personal communication ), long, anteroposteriorly flattened femur neck ( Marchi et al., 2017 ), thorax shape ( Williams et al., 2017 ), and markedly curved finger bones ( Kivell et al., 2015 ), might be interpreted as evolutionary reversals. If H. naledi is a sister taxon to a clade including H. habilis, H. rudolfensis and all other large-brained species of Homo, then the larger brain size of these other species of Homo could be homologous. But this scenario would require many parallel evolutionary developments in H. naledi and H. sapiens, including hand and wrist morphology ( Kivell et al., 2015 ), foot\u00a0morphology ( Harcourt-Smith et al., 2015 ), lower limb morphology ( Marchi et al., 2017 ), and some cranial and dental morphologies ( Laird et al., 2017; Schroeder et al., 2017 ). Some of these derived traits are also shared with H. erectus, others are not evidenced in any known H. erectus fossils. Whatever phylogenetic scenario we accept, H. naledi is not unique in demonstrating homoplasy ( Wood and Harrison, 2011 ), but it does present a uniquely strong postcranial record documenting its mosaic anatomy. The long evolutionary branch leading to H. naledi as represented in the Rising Star cave system may have implications for its mosaicism, at least with respect to cranial and mandibular form. Much of the evolution of cranial form among species of Homo in the Pleistocene appears to be consistent with neutral evolution by genetic drift, with a few features showing evidence of adaptive evolution ( Ackermann and Cheverud, 2004; Weaver et al., 2007; Schroeder et al., 2014 ). If the correlations among some aspects of H. naledi cranial anatomy were not constrained by selection, then a long evolutionary branch would create substantial opportunity for divergence over time by drift. Such non-adaptive evolution, combined with the\u00a0adaptive evolution of some traits, might create a unique pattern in this species ( Laird et al., 2017 ), although it seems likely that postcranial features would be subject to greater adaptive constraints. An alternative hypothesis for the homoplastic appearance of H. naledi is hybridization among two or more hominin lineages. As ancient DNA evidence has grown, it has become clear that hybridization among genetically distant human lineages occurred many times ( Kuhlwilm et al., 2016; Meyer et al., 2012; Pr\u00fcfer et al., 2014 ), as is the case in chimpanzees and bonobos ( de Manuel et al., 2016 ) and in\u00a0many other mammalian lineages ( Schaefer et al., 2016 ). The mosaic anatomy of H. naledi, which\u00a0includes many shared derived characters of modern humans and H. erectus, might suggest the hypothesis that H. naledi resulted from the hybridization of a more human-like population and a late-surviving australopith. This hypothesis remains untestable with the current evidence, although it seems more parsimonious to suggest that H. naledi itself survived from an early period of diversification of Homo. Morphology does not rule out\u00a0the\u00a0possibility that H. naledi originated in the Early Pleistocene as a result of the\u00a0hybridization of different populations, and persisted long after this hybrid speciation. The evidence of genetic mixture among more recent hominins makes this hypothesis seem reasonable, but again it is untestable unless genetic material is obtained from the fossils. Attempts to obtain aDNA from H. naledi remains have thus far proven unsuccessful. In\u00a0addition, we have reported several apparent autapomorphies that\u00a0are\u00a0present across the skeleton of H. naledi. These include the morphology of the thumb, aspects of the morphology\u00a0of the spine, and aspects of the morphology of the proximal femur ( Berger et al., 2015; Kivell et al., 2015; Marchi et al., 2017 ). Unfortunately, the Pliocene hominin record is poor, and without clearly understanding the ancestral lineage of H. naledi, and whether we have in fact already\u00a0discovered its ancestors, we cannot know whether such features may have been present in the last common ancestor ( LCA ) of H. naledi and other hominin species, and are thus actually primitive in H. naledi\u2019s lineage rather than uniquely derived. Therefore, the importance of these apparent autapomorphies in establishing the origins of H. naledi remain unresolved. Until now, palaeoanthropologists and archaeologists have generally assumed that morphologically primitive hominins such as H. naledi did not survive into the later parts of the Pleistocene in Africa. This assumption has guided the interpretation of fossil discoveries with poor geological or stratigraphic context, including the many surface finds that make up the majority of the record from ancient lacustrine and riverine deposits ( e. g. Taieb et al., 1976; Yuretich, 1979; Kalb et al., 1982; Tiercelin, 1986; Ward et al., 1999; WoldeGabriel et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2003; Gathogo and Brown, 2006; McDougall and Brown, 2006; Campisano and Feibel, 2008; Campisano, 2012 ). These and other studies have shown that in many African sedimentary contexts, Pliocene or Early Pleistocene sediments are overlain by deposits of Middle or Late Pleistocene age or even by\u00a0Holocene-aged deposits. It is common knowledge that fragmentary fossils of Plio-Pleistocene age occur ex situ on the surface with Middle Stone Age ( MSA ), Later Stone Age ( LSA ), or historic artifacts;\u00a0in the absence of in situ association, anthropologists often rely upon a fossil\u2019s morphology as an indicator of its age. The discovery of H. naledi provided a natural experiment to test whether anthropologists can reliably establish the approximate age of hominin fossil fragments from their morphology. Before the publication of a geological age for H. naledi, many anthropologists examined its entire morphological pattern and concluded that the species must date to more than 1. 5 million years ago. This includes one formal morphological study ( Thackeray, 2015 ) and many other published comments by experts. A second study concluded that\u00a0the Dinaledi hominin sample could be 930, 000 years old, though the confidence interval on this estimate ranged from the present to c. 2. 5 Ma ( Dembo et al., 2016 ). These examples show that expert intuition about the ages of fossil samples is likely to be wrong when based on their morphology alone. We must therefore demand fuller information about the geological context both of surface finds and of finds that are reported as in situ. If fragments of H. naledi had been found in isolation\u2014instead of in the cohesive assemblage of the Dinaledi Chamber\u2014many parts of its anatomy individually may have been confused for hominin material of Pliocene age. As we have noted, parts of the H. naledi cranial vault, dentition, shoulder, manual phalanges, pelvis and proximal femur would be easily misattributed to Australopithecus. Other parts of the hand, dentition, foot, and lower limb exhibit morphology similar to that\u00a0of\u00a0modern humans or H. erectus. As we know neither the origination point nor the extinction time of H. naledi, it is conceivable that fragments from this species have already been misattributed to other hominin taxa. H. naledi has traits that\u00a0were\u00a0long considered to be adaptations for creating material culture. Its wrist, hand and fingertip morphology share several derived features with Neanderthals and modern humans that are absent in H. habilis, H. floresiensis, and Au. sediba ( Kivell et al., 2015 ). If these features evolved to support habitual tool manufacture in Neanderthals and modern humans, then it is reasonable to conclude that H. naledi was also\u00a0fully competent in\u00a0using\u00a0tools. The use of tools and the consumption of higher-quality foodstuffs including meat and processed plant resources have been hypothesized as evolutionary pressures leading to dental reduction in hominins ( Zink and Lieberman, 2016 ). The small dentition of H. naledi manifests this adaptive strategy to a greater extent than H. habilis, H. rudolfensis and most H. erectus samples ( Berger et al., 2015; Hawks et al., 2017 ), though without the predicted encephalization. What tools did H. naledi make ? Its lineage may have existed across much or all of the time during\u00a0which\u00a0African hominin populations were manufacturing Acheulean and possibly even Oldowan assemblages ( e. g. Mcbrearty and Brooks, 2000 ). The H. naledi lineage also existed during at least the first half of the MSA, which as an archaeological category seems to have commenced more than 400 ka in several instances in subequatorial and northeastern Africa ( Dusseldorp et al., 2013; Wilkins and Chazan, 2012; McBrearty and Tryon, 2006; Mcbrearty and Brooks, 2000 ). Many previous workers have grappled with the question of which hominin species were the makers of Early Stone Age industries ( e. g. Foley, 1987; Susman, 1991; Domalain et al., 2016 ). A key part of these considerations has been the role of brain size and behavioural ecology in sustaining traditions, which have supported the role of larger-brained H. habilis and H. erectus as toolmakers and have\u00a0downplayed the possibility that small-brained Paranthropus may likewise have innovated ( e. g. Hopkinson et al., 2013; Domalain et al., 2016 ). With some exceptions ( e. g. Stringer, 2011 ), there has been a widespread assumption that MSA traditions were made by modern humans or their ancestors, whether denoted as \u2018archaic H. sapiens\u2019 or as\u00a0a precursor such as \u2018H. helmei\u2019 ( Mcbrearty and Brooks, 2000; Lahr and Foley, 2001; Stringer, 2002; Henshilwood and Marean, 2003; Henshilwood and Marean, 2006; Dusseldorp et al., 2013 ). MSA variants are characterized by the manufacture of blades, by\u00a0the\u00a0presence of the Levallois flaking technique and of hafted implements, at some locations\u00a0by the use of pigments, and by\u00a0a lack of emphasis on large cutting tools such as the handaxes and cleavers of the Acheulean industry ( e. g. Mcbrearty and Brooks, 2000; Henshilwood and Marean, 2003; Marean and Assefa, 2005; Henshilwood and Marean, 2006 ). Some of these technical innovations have even been considered as markers of modern human behaviour. However, it is now clear that the populations of subequatorial Africa had deep prehistoric divisions ( Stringer, 2016; Lachance et al., 2012; Hsieh et al., 2016 ) and that multiple genetically and morphologically divergent hominin populations probably created Acheulean and MSA archaeological traditions. This situation is paralleled outside of Africa, where most of the manufacturing techniques that characterize the MSA were also mastered by Neanderthals and possibly by\u00a0Denisovans ( Roebroeks and Soressi, 2016;\u00a0d\u2019Errico and Banks, 2013 ). These archaic populations diverged from African populations well before the appearance of such techniques either in Africa or in\u00a0Eurasia ( Meyer et al., 2016 ), so these techniques must either have been invented independently multiple times or have been transferred by long-distance exchange of ideas across long-separated hominin populations. H. naledi existed contemporaneously with MSA archaeological industries across subequatorial and northeastern Africa ( Mcbrearty and Brooks, 2000; Henshilwood and Marean, 2003, Marean, 2006;\u00a0Marean and Assefa, 2005; Henshilwood and Marean, 2006; McBrearty and Tryon, 2006; Wilkins and Chazan, 2012; Dusseldorp et al., 2013; Wurz, 2013 ). Excavations in the Rising Star cave system have not yet uncovered artifacts in direct association with H. naledi. But considering the weak nature of the fossil hominin record, H. naledi may be the only hominin definitely\u00a0known to be present during at least the early part of the MSA in the highvelt region of southern Africa ( Dusseldorp et al., 2013 ). Considering the context, it is possible that H. naledi sustained MSA traditions. Without extraordinary evidence, we cannot uncritically accept that such a broadly defined archaeological tradition was the exclusive product of a single population across Africa. Did H. naledi deliberately deposit bodies within the Rising Star cave system ? With respect to the deposition of the fossil material, it is appropriate to adopt a null hypothesis that the remains entered the Dinaledi and Lesedi Chambers without intentional hominin mediation, and to\u00a0see whether the evidence can reject that hypothesis. We have previously examined depositional scenarios on the basis of evidence from the Dinaledi Chamber ( Dirks et al., 2015, 2016; Randolph-Quinney et al., 2016 ). The discovery of hominin material in the Lesedi Chamber adds a second instance of deposition of hominin skeletal material within the cave system. Some other cave systems in the Cradle of Humankind area likewise present evidence of multiple episodes of the deposition of hominin remains. Swartkrans has a complex series of infills that contain hominin and a broad array of macrofaunal remains, many of which bear evidence of carnivore or scavenger activity representing multiple accumulating agents ( Pickering et al., 2004a ). Further, evidence of cutmarks, percussion marks, and burned bone show that hominins were an accumulating agent of some Swartkrans faunal remains ( Pickering et al., 2005 ). Sterkfontein is another cave system that\u00a0has a complex series of infills, in which much bone material bears traces of carnivore and scavenger activity. Within Sterkfontein, the Silberberg Grotto is a deep chamber that contains one hominin skeleton ( StW 573 ) together with faunal remains that appear to have fallen from above; it\u00a0is\u00a0a death trap ( Pickering et al., 2004a ). Also within the Sterkfontein system, the Jacovec Cavern breccia presents some evidence for water transport of material from the surface and water sorting of bone ( Kibii, 2007 ). These examples provide several hypotheses for the deposition of hominin skeletal remains that do not involve intentional behaviour by the hominins themselves, and we have previously examined whether the Dinaledi Chamber evidence is compatible with any of them ( Dirks et al., 2015, 2016 ). While geological and sedimentological studies of the Lesedi Chamber are still ongoing, we can consider how its taphonomic situation resembles the Dinaledi Chamber material. In the Dinaledi Chamber, the skeletal material showed invertebrate surface modification but a complete lack of markings from carnivores, scavengers, or hominins ( Dirks et al., 2015, 2016 ). The Lesedi Chamber hominin material likewise presents no evidence of cutmarks, tooth marks, scoring, puncture marks, gnawing or bone cylinders, and only shows surface markings consistent with abrasion or pitting, many after the deposition of manganese and iron oxide coatings on the bones ( Hawks et al., 2017 ). These observations seem to exclude carnivores and scavengers as the\u00a0primary accumulating agents for the assemblages. The Dinaledi Chamber is enormously challenging to reach today, and both sedimentological and geological evidence supports the hypothesis that the chamber itself and the entry chute from the neighboring Dragon\u2019s Back Chamber had substantially the same configuration at the time at\u00a0which\u00a0the\u00a0H. naledi skeletal remains entered ( Dirks et al., 2015, 2016 ). Some have questioned whether one or more alternative entrances to the Dinaledi Chamber may once have existed, which might have made the physical situation much easier for H. naledi to enter the chamber from the outside ( Val, 2016; Thackeray, 2015 ). But any such entrance would have needed to replicate most of the constraints of the present entrance, or else it would not produce the sedimentological distinctiveness of the Dinaledi Chamber or the lack of non-hominin macrofauna ( Dirks et al., 2016; Randolph-Quinney et al., 2016 ). The situation in the Lesedi Chamber\u00a0makes these constraints of the Dinaledi Chamber even more apparent. The Lesedi Chamber is similarly situated deep inside the cave system, far inside the dark zone, with no nearby surface entrance ( Hawks et al., 2017 ). However, no strong physical constraint prevents macrofauna, at least those smaller than humans, from\u00a0entering. Faunal material in the chamber demonstrates that at least the remains of small carnivores and smaller fauna did enter the Lesedi Chamber, even though it is deep in the cave, well within the dark zone. Although we do not know the timing or manner in which these faunal elements entered the Lesedi Chamber, their presence reinforces the importance of physical constraints in\u00a0impeding entry into the Dinaledi Chamber, where no such faunal remains have been found ( Dirks et al., 2015 ). Further sedimentological and geological assessment of the Lesedi Chamber, and direct dating of the faunal and hominin remains, may clarify the relation of faunal and hominin remains. Val ( 2016 ) proposed that the hominin skeletal material from the Dinaledi Chamber may have been transported from another location within the cave system, which we have not located, but which might itself have been consistent with carnivore accumulation or a death trap from the surface. In Sterkfontein, there may have been redeposition of sediments from higher chambers into the Silberberg Grotto ( Kramers and Dirks, 2017 ), providing a possible example a process driven by gravity from above, although the StW 573 skeleton itself appears to be in near-primary context. No openings in the ceilings above the Dinaledi or Lesedi Chambers appear consistent with\u00a0the gravity-driven transport of material from directly above. The Dinaledi Chamber skeletal material shows no evidence of high-energy fluvial transport, which would have been necessary to move such a quantity of bone any horizontal distance through the cave ( Dirks et al., 2015, 2016 ). The same is true of the remains within the Lesedi Chamber ( Hawks et al., 2017 ). In both deposits, there is evidence of postdepositional reworking of sediments, but in both deposits, some articulated remains have been recovered, and neither the skeletal element representation nor the\u00a0physical condition of the remains are consistent with wholesale secondary redeposition of the hominin assemblages from any third location ( Dirks et al., 2016;\u00a0Hawks et al., 2017 ). We consider it untenable to hypothesize that both the Dinaledi Chamber and the Lesedi Chamber were accidental death trap situations. We have previously written ( Dirks et al., 2015, 2016 ) that the accidental death trap hypothesis was one that the physical evidence from the Dinaledi Chamber might not reject. Still, the evidence that hominin individuals of all ages were deposited in the chamber over some period of time, as well as the sediment composition within the chamber itself, led us to view that hypothesis as less likely. Other cave systems in the region have been hypothesized as death-trap situations, including Malapa ( Dirks et al., 2010; L'Abb\u00e9 et al., 2015; Val et al., 2015 ) and the Silberberg Grotto of Sterkfontein ( Pickering et al., 2004a ). In these instances, a relatively direct vertical route existed either from the surface or from cave chambers above;\u00a0furthermore, other non-cryptic macrofauna were\u00a0present\u00a0among the fossil remains, externally derived sediments\u00a0were\u00a0abundant, and ( in the case of Malapa ) plant remains were also present. No such evidence occurs in the Dinaledi Chamber. As we continue to study the geological history of the Rising Star system, it is possible that we will find that H. naledi or small carnivores accessed the Lesedi Chamber differently than excavators today, but we have found no evidence of a nearby vertical entry that would accommodate hominins. The presence of two such situations in the same cave system, with no remaining evidence of a death trap other than the hominin remains, would be unlikely. The evidence in its entirety appears incompatible with the hypothesis of accumulation in both the DInaledi and Lesedi Chambers without some hominin agency. However, with a later Middle Pleistocene date for the Dinaledi Chamber material, we must also consider the suggestion that modern humans or their immediate predecessors were accumulating agents for the H. naledi skeletal material ( e. g., C. Marean, quoted in Gibbons ( 2015]. This hypothesis would require that the modern humans left no cutmarks or tooth marks on the H. naledi material, and that they treated H. naledi remains differently than those of any other species, including modern humans themselves. Also, although it is possible that H. naledi may have existed in contact with ancestors of modern humans, we have as yet no evidence of this. We will continue to explore the possible interactions of H. naledi and other hominin populations, but they do not appear to be a likely explanation for the deposition of skeletal remains in the Rising Star cave system. We propose that funerary caching by H. naledi is a reasonable explanation for the presence of remains in the Dinaledi and Lesedi Chambers. Mortuary behaviours, while culturally diverse, are universal among modern human cultural groups ( Pettitt, 2010 ). Such behaviours are not seen in living non-human primates or in\u00a0other social mammals, but many social mammals exhibit signs of grief, distress, or other emotional response when other individuals within their social group die ( King, 2013 ). We have no information about whether H. naledi was a symbolic species, although with the possibility that it manufactured MSA toolkits, we do not rule out such abilities. But symbolic cognition is not likely to have been necessary to sustain a repeated cultural practice in response to the physical and social effects of the\u00a0deaths of group members ( Pettitt, 2010 ). Such behaviour may have many different motivations, from the removal of decaying bodies from habitation areas, to the prevention of scavenger activity, to social bonding, which are not mutually exclusive. We suggest only that such cultural behaviour may have been within the capabilities of a species that otherwise presents every appearance of technical and subsistence strategies that were common across the genus Homo. Fossil and genetic evidence shows that subequatorial Africa was home to diverse populations of hominins throughout the Pleistocene. The expansive savanna and open woodland habitats of this region have driven biodiversity in many mammals and birds that\u00a0have similar habitat preferences to hominins ( e. g. Bannerman and Burns, 1953; Kingdon, 2015; Payne, 2013 ). We suggest that for hominin populations too, subequatorial Africa appears to have been a source of biological diversity and innovation. No paleoanthropologist anticipated that a species like H. naledi existed in this region during the late Middle Pleistocene. However, considering a broad array of biogeographic, phylogenetic, and genetic evidence from humans and other mammals, the discovery of more members of a diverse community of hominin populations in this vast region should no longer be a surprise. This hypothesis should provoke greater examination of the paleoenvironments and regional paleoclimate across this region of Africa. Further, the presence of a diversity of hominin populations throughout most of the Pleistocene must lend caution to how we examine fragmentary specimens. Many of these populations and species are indistinguishable from each other in many parts of the skeleton, despite being very different in others. In\u00a0particular, we must apply renewed caution to behavioural inferences. The transition to early MSA industries is likely to have involved a broad array of hominin populations and/or species that possibly interacted with each other. Is H. naledi the direct ancestor of humans or of\u00a0any other hominins ? The later Middle Pleistocene age of the Dinaledi Chamber assemblage is substantially later than the date presently recognized for the first appearance of H. erectus some 1. 8 million years ago. The Dinaledi occurrence of H. naledi is later in time than the hypothesised genetic divergence of Neanderthal and modern human populations more than 500, 000 years ago ( Meyer et al., 2016 ). But a paleontological view recognizes that any particular set of fossils does not represent the entire time depth of a species or its relationships, and phylogenetic analyses of H. naledi show that the species and its branch must have existed much earlier than the Dinaledi fossils ( Dembo et al., 2016; Hawks and Berger, 2016;\u00a0Thackeray, 2015 ). One analysis of craniodental evidence places H. naledi amid the branches leading to H. habilis, Au. sediba, and H. rudolfensis, suggesting that its anatomical pattern may have been present from the earliest origin of Homo. Another analysis has placed H. naledi as a sister taxon to archaic species of Homo and modern humans, closer to living humans than H. erectus ( Dembo et al., 2016 ). If this is true, an early H. naledi population may have been the ancestor of humans, placing H. erectus as a side branch. H. naledi is clearly a primitive species within the genus Homo, despite sharing many derived features with archaic and modern humans. The fossil record for other species attributed to early Homo is presently too incomplete to ascertain whether these species also show such mosaicism, or whether they express different manifestations of primitive and derived morphological patterns. A species like H. naledi might well have given rise repeatedly to other branches of Homo, each derived in a somewhat different way. A fresh look at the hominin fossil record, setting aside a history of linear assumptions about the evolution of H. erectus and H. sapiens, may set a new context for further fossil discoveries. Better analytical techniques, and increased knowledge provided by aDNA, may shed further light on these questions . [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Species of ancient humans and the extinct relatives of our ancestors are typically described from a limited number of fossils. However, this was not the case with Homo naledi. More than 1, 500 fossils representing at least 15 individuals of this species were unearthed from the Rising Star cave system in South Africa between 2013 and 2014. Found deep underground in the Dinaledi Chamber, the H. naledi fossils are the largest collection of a single species of an ancient human-relative discovered in Africa. After the discovery was reported, a number of questions still remained. H. naledi had an unusual mix of ancient and modern traits. For example, it had a small brain like the most ancient of human-relatives, yet its wrists looked much like those of a modern human. This raised the question: where does H. naledi fit within the scheme of human evolution ? Now, Berger et al. \u2014who include many of the researchers who were involved in the discovery of H. naledi\u2014reconsider this question in the light of new findings reported in two related studies. First, Dirks et al. provide a long-anticipated estimate for the age of the fossils at between 236, 000 and 335, 000 years old. Second, Hawks et al. report the discovery of more H. naledi fossils from a separate chamber in the same cave system. These estimated dates fall in a period called the late Middle Pleistocene, and mean that H. naledi possibly lived at the same time, and in the same place, as modern humans. Berger et al. explain that the existence of a relatively primitive species like H. naledi living this recently in southern Africa is at odds with previous thinking about human evolution. Indeed, all other members of our family tree known from the same time had large brains and were generally much more evolved than our most ancient relatives. However, Berger et al. argue that we have only an incomplete picture of our evolutionary past, and suggest that old fossils might have been assigned to the wrong species or time period. Reassessing the old fossils might lead the scientific community to rethink what kinds of human-relative were around in southern Africa at different times, and what those ancient species were capable of. For example, archeologists had previously thought that modern humans made all the stone tools dating from around the late Middle Pleistocene found in southern Africa, but now we must consider whether some of them could have been made by H. naledi ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nEmerging evidence suggests that dopamine may modulate learning and memory with important implications for understanding the neurobiology of memory and future therapeutic targeting. An influential hypothesis posits that dopamine biases reinforcement learning. More recent data also suggest an influence during both consolidation and retrieval. Eighteen Parkinson\u2019s disease patients learned through feedback ON or OFF medication, with memory tested 24 hr later ON or OFF medication ( 4 conditions, within-subjects design with matched healthy control group ). Patients OFF medication during learning decreased in memory accuracy over the following 24 hr. In contrast to previous studies, however, dopaminergic medication during learning and testing did not affect expression of positive or negative reinforcement. Two further experiments were run without the 24 hr delay, but they too failed to reproduce effects of dopaminergic medication on reinforcement learning. While supportive of a dopaminergic role in consolidation, this study failed to replicate previous findings on reinforcement learning.  Phasic changes in dopamine level are believed to encode the reward prediction error ( RPE ), which measures the difference between the reward expected after an action, and the reward actually received ( Schultz et al., 1993, Schultz et al., 1997 ). In turn the RPE guides reinforcement learning ( RL ) such that behaviour is adapted to changing surroundings. Several studies have taken advantage of the dopaminergic depletion in Parkinson\u2019s disease ( PD ) in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area ( Agid et al., 1989; Shulman et al., 2011 ). PD patients are frequently treated with dopamine replacement therapy ( levodopa and dopamine agonists ), and thus by comparing patients in ON and OFF medication states the effects of dopamine depletion can be investigated. One influential study using such a procedure found that dopaminergic state modulated RL from positive and negative feedback ( Frank et al., 2004 ). This study used the Probabilistic Selection Task ( PST ), in which participants see two Japanese Hiragana symbols on the screen at the same time, and must pick one, receiving either \u2018Correct\u2019 or \u2018Incorrect\u2019 feedback ( see Figure 1 ). This feedback is determined probabilistically, so that card A in pair AB is given positive feedback on 80% of trials, and negative feedback on 20%, and vice versa for card B. Pairs CD and EF have probabilities 70\u201330% and 60\u201340%, respectively. During the learning trials, if a participant chooses card A over card B, this could be because they have learned that card A is more often rewarded and should be chosen, or that card B is more often punished and should be avoided \u2013 one cannot tell these apart from this choice. So, a novel pairs test is given where all the cards are shown in all possible combinations ( e. g. AB, AC, AD, AE\u2026 ), without feedback, and from this the percentage of times that card A is chosen, and card B avoided, can be used as benchmarks for positive and negative reinforcement, respectively. 10. 7554/eLife. 26801. 003Figure 1. Diagram of the learning trials of the Probabilistic Selection Task. In each pair one card is more likely to be rewarded ( shown \u2018Correct\u2019 feedback ) than the other, with card A in pair AB rewarded 80% of trials, and card B on 20% of trials. For pairs CD and EF, the probabilities are 70\u201330% and 60\u201340%. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 26801. 003 PD patients chose A more and avoided B less when ON medication, and vice versa for OFF medication ( Frank et al., 2004 ). This suggested better learning from positive reinforcement and poorer negative reinforcement ON medication, while patients OFF showed the opposite pattern. Importantly, patients OFF medication were better at negative reinforcement than healthy age-matched controls ( HC ), suggesting that PD actually improved some aspect of RL. The explanation for these effects was provided with a model of the basal ganglia. In the Go-NoGo model, the two main pathways from the striatum are proposed to underlie positive and negative reinforcement. The direct pathway, which is mainly activated by striatal neurons containing dopamine D1 receptors and therefore is activated by a dopamine increase during a positive RPE, underlies positive reinforcement. The indirect pathway which is inhibited by D2 receptors, and therefore activated when a dopamine decrease signals a negative RPE, allows negative reinforcement. When PD patients are ON medication, the higher dopamine levels activate D1 receptors and inhibit D2 receptors, thus biasing towards the direct pathway, improving positive reinforcement. When OFF medication, the lower dopamine levels mean less D1 activation, and less D2 inhibition, thus increasing indirect pathway activity, and improving negative reinforcement. While this view is persuasive, some more recent studies have cast doubts on the extent to which dopamine is involved in the learning part of RL, and how much is the expression of that learning. In Frank et al. ( 2004 ) study, the RL test was given immediately after learning, and it was only in this test that the effects were seen. However, as patients were ON for both learning and testing, or OFF for both, it meant that the dopaminergic effects could have occurred at either point. One study attempted to correct for this by adding a one hour delay between learning and testing, allowing PD patients to learn OFF medication, then be tested ON medication ( along with ON-ON and OFF-OFF conditions ) ( Shiner et al., 2012 ). It was found that being ON medication at the time of testing produced greater expression of positive reinforcement than being OFF, while it had no effect during learning. Additionally, RPE signals in the striatum during learning were not affected by medication state, but ventromedial PFC and nucleus accumbens signals in the test phase only tracked the value of the stimuli when patients were ON medication. This suggests that dopamine may not play as much of a role in learning, but instead influence the choices made after the expected rewards have been learnt. Other studies have also shown dopaminergic D2 receptor effects mainly on the expression rather than learning ( Eisenegger et al., 2014; Pessiglione et al., 2006 ). The direct link between dopamine and RL, as opposed to expression of information, was further questioned by another study, which found that dopaminergic effects could be shown even when rewards were not actually given during learning ( Smittenaar et al., 2012 ). Participants received one of two shapes, probabilistically, after selecting a stimulus, and only after the learning trials were they told that one shape corresponded to winning money, and one to losing money. Thus, the reward/monetary associations were created separately to the stimulus-outcome associations. However, they still found that PD patients ON medication during testing ( after finding out about the money ), showed higher accuracy on the most rewarded stimulus, and lower accuracy on the most punished stimulus. This shows that it is possible to generate this effect without any reinforcement learning actually taking place, suggesting dopamine influences value-based decision making. A recent extension to standard RL models offers a mechanism by which dopamine may influence expression of learning. The OpAL model ( Collins and Frank, 2014 ) has separate learning rates and choice parameters for the direct and indirect pathways, which learn from positive and negative reinforcement, respectively. By allowing dopamine to affect the choice parameter, it can bias towards choosing the stimulus that learned mainly from the direct pathway, or from the indirect pathway, thus lending more weight to the positive or negative reinforcement the stimulus received. In addition to evidence of dopamine affecting expression of learned values, there is also evidence of it affecting consolidation. PD patients ON medication showed an increase in accuracy on an RL task after a 20 min delay, while those OFF medication showed a large decrease ( Coulthard et al., 2012 ). This was despite all PD patients showing the same behaviour during the learning trials. It is still possible that this is a retrieval effect, and that it was simply not seen during the learning trials as the values were still being updated, but it is also possible that the dopaminergic medication preserved the synaptic weight changes induced during learning, thus improving memory for the learned items. This explanation ties in nicely with models of synaptic consolidation based on the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis ( Clopath et al., 2008; Frey and Morris, 1998; Redondo and Morris, 2011 ). In these models, early synaptic changes are induced during learning, but decay away unless actively prolonged, which is achieved by the changes setting a \u2018tag\u2019 which plasticity-related proteins ( PRPs ) must act on to make the changes permanent. Dopamine is hypothesised to set the threshold for the synthesis of these PRPs, so that higher levels of dopamine mean a lower threshold. Thus, PD patients OFF medication would have a higher PRP threshold, and therefore lower consolidation of early synaptic changes, leading to a delayed impairment of memory, as seen in Coulthard et al. ( 2012 ). Here, we sought to investigate the hypotheses that: These hypotheses were tested in experiment 1 where surprisingly we did not show the expected effects of dopamine on novel pairs choices. We undertook a further two experiments to investigate the effects of dopamine and delays on RL, and the effects of procedural changes to the PST.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Brain cells release a naturally occurring chemical called dopamine. The release of this chemical affects how people respond to their ever-changing environment, including how they learn from rewards and punishments. Parkinson\u2019s disease is a condition where the brain cells that make dopamine start to die, and so the levels of dopamine in the brain begin to drop. Parkinson\u2019s disease patients are routinely given drugs to bring their dopamine levels back up to near-normal levels. About 13 years ago, researchers found that when patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease were given dopamine-medication they were better at learning from rewards and worse at learning from punishments. If the patients were withdrawn from their dopamine-medications they were worse at learning from rewards but better at learning from punishments. However, it was not clear if this was because the dopamine affects the learning process, or if it affects how people remember what they learned and how they make choices later on. To better understand how dopamine is involved in learning in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, Grogan et al. looked at the effects of dopamine on memory over a timescale of 24 hours. People with Parkinson\u2019s disease and healthy volunteers were shown a choice of symbols and given the chance to learn which gave a reward \u2013 a picture of a smiling face \u2013 and which gave a punishment \u2013 a frowning face. If the Parkinson\u2019s disease patients had taken their dopamine-medication before learning the task, their memory did not worsen over the next 24 hours. This suggests that having dopamine in the brain around the time of learning helped the patients to store the memory. The patients, however, were not any better at learning from rewards when taking their medication, which contradicts some earlier studies. To explore this further, Grogan et al. copied the exact same task from the 13-year-old study, and still did not find that patients were better at learning from reward when taking dopamine. These findings could help scientists to better understand what dopamine does during learning and memory, and how the brain normally works. Finally, Parkinson\u2019s disease causes problems with memory.

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nChemical synaptic transmission relies on the Ca2+-induced fusion of transmitter-laden vesicles whose coupling distance to Ca2+ channels determines synaptic release probability and short-term plasticity, the facilitation or depression of repetitive responses. Here, using electron- and super-resolution microscopy at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction we quantitatively map vesicle:Ca2+ channel coupling distances. These are very heterogeneous, resulting in a broad spectrum of vesicular release probabilities within synapses. Stochastic simulations of transmitter release from vesicles placed according to this distribution revealed strong constraints on short-term plasticity; particularly facilitation was difficult to achieve. We show that postulated facilitation mechanisms operating via activity-dependent changes of vesicular release probability ( e. g. by a facilitation fusion sensor ) generate too little facilitation and too much variance. In contrast, Ca2+-dependent mechanisms rapidly increasing the number of releasable vesicles reliably reproduce short-term plasticity and variance of synaptic responses. We propose activity-dependent inhibition of vesicle un-priming or release site activation as novel facilitation mechanisms.  At chemical synapses, neurotransmitters ( NTs ) are released from presynaptic neurons and subsequently activate postsynaptic receptors to transfer information. At the presynapse, incoming action potentials ( APs ) trigger the opening of voltage gated Ca2+\u00a0channels, leading to Ca2+ influx. This local Ca2+\u00a0signal induces the rapid fusion of NT-containing synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) at active zones ( AZs ) ( S\u00fcdhof, 2012 ). In preparation for fusion, SVs localize ( dock ) to the AZ plasma membrane and undergo functional maturation ( priming ) into a readily releasable pool ( RRP ) ( Kaeser and Regehr, 2017; Verhage and S\u00f8rensen, 2008 ). These reactions are mediated by an evolutionarily highly conserved machinery. The SV protein VAMP2/Synaptobrevin and the plasma membrane proteins Syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 are essential for docking and priming and the assembly of these proteins into the ternary SNARE complex provides the energy for SV fusion ( Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012 ). The SNARE interacting proteins ( M ) Unc18s and ( M ) Unc13s ( where \u2018M\u2019 indicates mammalian ) are also essential for SV docking, priming and NT release ( Rizo and S\u00fcdhof, 2012; S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009 ), while Ca2+ triggering of SV fusion depends on vesicular Ca2+\u00a0sensors of the Synaptotagmin family ( Littleton and Bellen, 1995; S\u00fcdhof, 2013; Walter et al., 2011; Yoshihara et al., 2003 ). Cooperative binding of multiple Ca2+ ions to the SV fusion machinery increases the probability of SV fusion ( pVr ) in a non-linear manner ( Bollmann et al., 2000; Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967; Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000 ). A distinguishing feature of synapses is their activity profile upon repeated AP activation, where responses deviate between successive stimuli, resulting in either short-term facilitation ( STF ) or short-term depression ( STD ). This short-term plasticity ( STP ) fulfils essential temporal computational tasks ( Abbott and Regehr, 2004 ). Postsynaptic STP mechanisms can involve altered responsiveness of receptors to NT binding, while presynaptic mechanisms can involve alterations in Ca2+ signalling and \u2013sensitivity of SV fusion ( von Gersdorff and Borst, 2002; Zucker and Regehr, 2002 ). Presynaptic STD is often attributed to high pVr synapses, where a single AP causes significant depletion of the RRP. In contrast, presynaptic STF has often been attributed to synapses with low initial pVr and a rapid pVr increase during successive APs. This was often linked to changes in Ca2+ signalling, for instance by rapid regulation of Ca2+ channels ( Borst and Sakmann, 1998; Nanou and Catterall, 2018 ), saturation of local Ca2+ buffers ( Eggermann et al., 2012; Felmy et al., 2003; Matveev et al., 2004 ), or the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ which may increase pVr either directly or via \u2018facilitation sensors\u2019 ( Jackman and Regehr, 2017; Katz and Miledi, 1968 ). Alternatively, fast mechanisms increasing the RRP were proposed ( Fioravante and Regehr, 2011; Gustafsson et al., 2019; Pan and Zucker, 2009; Pulido and Marty, 2017 ). The coupling distance between Ca2+ channels and primed SVs is an important factor governing pVr ( B\u00f6hme et al., 2018; Eggermann et al., 2012; Stanley, 2016 ). Previous mathematical models describing SV fusion rates from simulated intracellular Ca2+ transients have in many cases relied on the assumption of uniform ( or near uniform ) distances between SV release sites surrounding a cluster of Ca2+ channels and such conditions were shown to generate STF ( B\u00f6hme\u00a0et al., 2016; Meinrenken et al., 2002; Nakamura et al., 2015; Vyleta and Jonas, 2014 ). However, alternative SV\u00a0release site:Ca2+ channel topologies have been proposed, including two distinct perimeter distances, tight, one-to-one connections of SVs and channels, or random placement of either the channels, the SVs, or both ( He et al., 2019;\u00a0B\u00f6hme et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2015; Guerrier and Holcman, 2018; Keller et al., 2015; Shahrezaei et al., 2006; Stanley, 2016; Wong et al., 2014 ). So far, the precise relationship between SV release sites and voltage gated Ca2+ channels on the nanometre scale is unknown for most synapses, primarily owing to technical difficulties to reliably map their precise spatial distribution. However, ( M ) Unc13 proteins were recently identified as a molecular marker of SV release sites ( Reddy-Alla et al., 2017; Sakamoto et al., 2018 ) and super-resolution ( STED ) microscopy revealed that these sites surround a cluster of voltage gated Ca2+ channels in the center of AZs of the glutamatergic Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) ( B\u00f6hme et al., 2016; B\u00f6hme et al., 2019 ). Here, by relying on the unique advantage of being able to precisely map SV\u00a0release site:Ca2+\u00a0channel topology we study its consequence for short-term plasticity at the Drosophila NMJ. Topologies were measured using electron microscopy ( EM ) following high pressure freeze fixation ( HPF ) or STED microscopy of Unc13 which both revealed a broad distribution of Ca2+ channel coupling distances. Stochastic simulations were key to identify facilitation mechanisms in the light of heterogenous SV\u00a0release\u00a0site:Ca2+ channel distances. Contrasting these simulations to physiological data revealed that models explaining STF through gradual increase in pVr ( from now on called \u2018pVr-based models\u2019 ) are inconsistent with the experiment while models of activity-dependent regulation of the RRP account for STP profiles and synaptic variance.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells in the nervous system of all animals communicate by releasing and sensing chemicals at contact points named synapses. The \u2018talking\u2019 ( or pre-synaptic ) cell stores the chemicals close to the synapse, in small spheres called vesicles. When the cell is activated, calcium ions flow in and interact with the release-ready vesicles, which then spill the chemicals into the synapse. In turn, the \u2018listening\u2019 ( or post-synaptic ) cell can detect the chemicals and react accordingly. When the pre-synaptic cell is activated many times in a short period, it can release a greater quantity of chemicals, allowing a bigger reaction in the post-synaptic cell. This phenomenon is known as facilitation, but it is still unclear how exactly it can take place. This is especially the case when many of the vesicles are not ready to respond, for example when they are too far from where calcium flows into the cell. Computer simulations have been created to model facilitation but they have assumed that all vesicles are placed at the same distance to the calcium entry point: Kobbersmed et al. now provide evidence that this assumption is incorrect. Two high-resolution imaging techniques were used to measure the actual distances between the vesicles and the calcium source in the pre-synaptic cells of fruit flies: this showed that these distances are quite variable \u2013 some vesicles sit much closer to the source than others. This information was then used to create a new computer model to simulate facilitation. The results from this computing work led Kobbersmed et al. to suggest that facilitation may take place because a calcium-based mechanism in the cell increases the number of vesicles ready to release their chemicals. This new model may help researchers to better understand how the cells in the nervous system work. Ultimately, this can guide experiments to investigate what happens when information processing at synapses breaks down, for example in diseases such as epilepsy ."}

Here we identify an asymmetry in pH between mother and daughter cells that underlies aging and rejuvenation. Cytosolic pH increases in aging mother cells, but is more acidic in daughter cells. This is due to the asymmetric distribution of the major regulator of cytosolic pH, the plasma membrane proton ATPase ( Pma1 ). Pma1 accumulates in aging mother cells, but is largely absent from nascent daughter cells. We previously found that acidity of the vacuole declines in aging mother cells and limits lifespan, but that daughter cell vacuoles re-acidify. We find that Pma1 activity antagonizes mother cell vacuole acidity by reducing cytosolic protons. However, the inherent asymmetry of Pma1 increases cytosolic proton availability in daughter cells and facilitates vacuole re-acidification and rejuvenation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Aging is a part of life\u2014but its biological basis and, in particular, how aged cells give rise to young offspring ( or progeny ) has not been clearly established for any organism. Budding yeast is a microorganism that is a valuable model to understand aging in more complex organisms like humans. Budding yeast cells undergo a process called \u2018replicative aging\u2019, meaning that each yeast mother cell produces a set number of daughter cells in her lifetime. However, when daughter cells arise from an aging mother cell, the daughter's age is \u2018reset to zero\u2019. How mother cells age, and how their daughters are rejuvenated, are questions that have been studied for decades. Previously, researchers discovered that a mother cell's vacuole ( an acidic compartment that stores important molecules that can become toxic ) becomes less acidic as the mother cell ages. Daughter cells, on the other hand, have very acidic vacuoles, which was linked to their renewed lifespans. However, the mechanism behind this difference in the acidity of the vacuole between mother and daughter cells was unknown. Now, Henderson et al. have found that a protein ( called Pma1 ), which is found at the cell surface and pumps protons out of the cell, is present in mother cells but not in their newly-formed daughter cells. Furthermore, the Pma1 protein also accumulates as mother cells age. By pumping protons out of the cell, Pma1 effectively reduces the number of protons available to acidify the vacuole in the mother cell. However, because at first the daughter does not have Pma1, there are still plenty of protons inside the cell to acidify the vacuole. When Henderson et al. reduced the activity of Pma1 in mother cells, the entire cell became more acidic, and so did their vacuoles. Conversely daughter cells engineered to have more Pma1 were less acidic and had less acidic vacuoles than normal. Henderson et al. next asked whether reducing Pma1 activity to create a more acidic cell, could extend the lifespan of cells, and found that indeed cells with less Pma1 activity lived longer. As such, these findings indicate that an asymmetry in the acidity of the cell\u2014caused by unequal levels of the Pma1 protein\u2014contributes to reducing the lifespan of the mother cell and to rejuvenating the daughter cell. Thus Henderson et al. have identified one of the earliest events in the cellular aging process in budding yeast. Their findings suggest that an imbalance in an activity that is normally essential for cell survival ( in this case, the activity of Pma1 ) can have long-term consequences for the cell that lead to aging ."}

Varenicline reduced nicotine upregulation of \u03b14\u03b22-type nicotinic receptors ( \u03b14\u03b22Rs ) in live cells and neurons, but not for membrane preparations. Effects on upregulation depended on intracellular pH homeostasis and were not observed if acidic pH in intracellular compartments was neutralized. Varenicline was trapped as a weak base in acidic compartments and slowly released, blocking 125I-epibatidine binding and desensitizing \u03b14\u03b22Rs. Epibatidine itself was trapped; 125I-epibatidine slow release from acidic vesicles was directly measured and required the presence of \u03b14\u03b22Rs. Nicotine exposure increased epibatidine trapping by increasing the numbers of acidic vesicles containing \u03b14\u03b22Rs. We conclude that varenicline as a smoking cessation agent differs from nicotine through trapping in \u03b14\u03b22R-containing acidic vesicles that is selective and nicotine-regulated. Our results provide a new paradigm for how smoking cessation occurs and suggest how more effective smoking cessation reagents can be designed.  Tobacco continues to be widely used world-wide, primarily via cigarette smoking, and is the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States ( National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion ( US ) Office on Smoking and Health, 2014 ). The currently approved treatments for smoking cessation are nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline ( Chantix ). While varenicline is\u00a0the most effective, successful quit rates only reach\u00a0~50% of smokers ( Agboola et al., 2015 ). Other therapies or novel approaches are clearly needed to increase rates of smoking cessation, and the design of smoking cessation reagents would be greatly aided with a mechanistic understanding of how the reagents act. Nicotine binds to high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) in the brain, and binding initiates its addictive effects. nAChRs are members of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels, all of which are pentameric neurotransmitter receptors ( Karlin, 2002; Albuquerque et al., 2009 ). In the mammalian CNS, these critical binding sites are nAChRs composed of \u03b12 -\u00a0\u03b16 and \u03b22 -\u00a0\u03b24 subunits; the most predominant contains \u03b14 and \u03b22 subunits ( Lindstrom, 1996; McGehee and Role, 1995 ). The \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR subtype ( \u03b14\u03b22R ) is closely linked to nicotine addiction ( Govind et al., 2009; Vezina et al., 2007; Lewis and Picciotto, 2013 ). Loss of either subunit in\u00a0\u03b14 or \u03b22 subunit knockout mice reduces the pharmacological and behavioral effects of nicotine ( Picciotto et al., 1998; Marubio et al., 2003 ). In addition, targeted expression of\u00a0\u03b22 subunits in the brain ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) of\u00a0\u03b22-knockout mice rescues nicotine-seeking behavior and nicotine-induced dopamine release ( Maskos et al., 2005 ). Varenicline is a high-affinity partial agonist for \u03b14\u03b22R. The rationale for its design as a smoking cessation reagent was predicated on the idea that a partial agonist could compete for and reduce cell-surface \u03b14\u03b22R activation by nicotine, reduce dopamine overflow in the mesolimbic reward system and thereby reduce the reward sensation of smoking ( Rollema et al., 2007 ). Varenicline does indeed reduce the rapid effects of nicotine on \u03b14\u03b22Rs in VTA dopaminergic neurons and acutely reduces nicotine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens ( Rollema et al., 2007 ). How varenicline alters the longer-lasting effects of nicotine is less clear, however. Nicotine upregulation of nAChRs is linked to different processes in nicotine addiction, including sensitization ( Govind et al., 2009; Vezina et al., 2007 ) and withdrawal ( De Biasi et al., 2011 ) and is the only effect of nicotine on nAChRs that lasts longer than a few minutes. Upregulation occurs when nicotine exposure increases high-affinity nicotine-binding sites in brain, measured by radiolabeled agonists such as nicotine ( Marks et al., 1983; Schwartz and Kellar, 1983; Benwell et al., 1988; Breese et al., 1997 ) or epibatidine ( Perry et al., 1999 ). Chronic varenicline exposure in mice induces upregulation to the same degree, or even more than, chronic nicotine exposure when measured using 3H-epibatidine binding to membrane preparations from different brain regions ( Hussmann et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2011 ). Recent studies using PET imaging in humans found that reversal of \u03b14\u03b22R upregulation was correlated with less smoking relapse ( Brody et al., 2013; Staley et al., 2006; Cosgrove et al., 2009 ). Thus, the observation that varenicline induced upregulation like nicotine was surprising and difficult to reconcile with its smoking cessation actions. In this study, we describe novel, long-lasting changes in nicotine upregulation by varenicline and other \u03b14\u03b22R ligands. The weak base nature of varenicline and other \u03b14\u03b22R ligands was fundamental to this action on upregulation. Nicotinic receptor ligands that are weak bases have two states, the membrane permeable uncharged state and the membrane impermeable protonated state. Nicotine accumulates in intracellular acidic compartments of cells and neurons because it is more highly protonated at the lower pH ( Brown and Garthwaite, 1979; Bhagat, 1970; Putney and Borzelleca, 1971 ), which leads to \u2018trapping\u2019 in these compartments in Xenopus oocytes expressing \u03b14\u03b22Rs. After removal of extracellular nicotine, nicotine slowly leaks from the intracellular compartments and causes \u03b14\u03b22R desensitization at the plasma membrane ( Jia et al., 2003 ). However, an analogous phenomenon was not observed in mammalian cells heterologously expressing \u03b14\u03b22Rs ( Jia et al., 2003 ), raising questions as to its relevance to neuronal adaptations to chronic nicotine exposure. Here we find that varenicline, as well as lobeline and epibatidine, are trapped as weak bases within acidic vesicles of live mammalian cells and neurons; in contrast, nicotine rapidly exits these vesicles. The trapping is selective depending on ligand pKa and affinity for \u03b14\u03b22Rs in acidic vesicles. Using 125I-epibatidine binding, we directly measured trapping and slow release from acidic vesicles and found it required \u03b14\u03b22R expression and increased with nicotine upregulation. Using pH-sensitive, pHluorin-tagged\u00a0\u03b14 subunits, we found that nicotine increased the numbers of acidic vesicles containing \u03b14\u03b22Rs, thereby promoting accumulation of 125I-epibatidine. Our results provide a new paradigm for how smoking cessation occurs and suggests how more effective smoking cessation reagents can be designed.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Tobacco continues to be widely used worldwide, primarily via cigarette smoking, and is a leading cause of preventable deaths. Stopping smoking is difficult because the nicotine in tobacco is highly addictive, and so several drugs have been developed to help people break their addiction. Varenicline ( also known by the trade name Chantix ) is a commonly prescribed anti-smoking drug, but it is not fully understood how it works. Nicotine affects the brain by binding to proteins called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) that sit on the surface of neurons. This binding releases a number of chemical signals, including some that produce feelings of pleasure. Over time, the receptors become less sensitive to nicotine and produce more \u201chigh-affinity\u201d binding sites for nicotine to bind to. This adaptation is one reason why stopping smoking can produce strong feelings of withdrawal. Previously, varenicline was thought to partially activate nAChRs, preventing nicotine from binding to the receptors. However, this can only explain how varenicline counteracts the rapid-acting effects of nicotine, not nicotine\u2019s longer-term effects. Furthermore, it was not known how nAChR signaling responds to long-term exposure to a combination of both drugs ( as occurs when people try to quit smoking with the aid of varenicline ). Now, Govind et al. reveal how varenicline reverses the effect of long-term nicotine exposure on nAChR signaling. Both varenicline and nicotine accumulate in acidic compartments \u2013 called vesicles \u2013 inside cells, where they become charged and less able to move through the cell membrane. When the vesicles also contain high-affinity nAChRs, varenicline becomes trapped inside them and is only slowly released. By contrast, nicotine is not trapped because it exits the vesicles more rapidly. Long-term exposure to nicotine greatly increased the number of vesicles that contained high-affinity nAChRs, thereby trapping more varenicline. One consequence of trapping varenicline was that the activity of the nAChRs on the surface of the neuron was diminished, apparently through the slow release of the trapped varenicline from the acidic vesicles. This slow release causes the receptors to enter a \u201cdesensitized\u201d state in which they do not signal. Understanding how varenicline counteracts the long-term effects of nicotine on nAChR signaling will help us to design more effective anti-smoking drugs. Govind et al. also found that compounds similar to varenicline become trapped in vesicles, but it is not clear how the degree of trapping of a compound correlates with how effectively it combats nicotine addiction. The results may also help us to understand and treat addictions to other drugs of abuse, such as opioids, amphetamines and cocaine, which have chemical properties that mean they might also be selectively trapped in acidic vesicles ."}

However, the in vivo distribution and function of gap junctions remain poorly understood, partly due to the lack of non-invasive tools with both cell-type specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we developed PARIS ( pairing actuators and receivers to optically isolate gap junctions ), a new fully genetically encoded tool for measuring the cell-specific gap junctional coupling ( GJC ). PARIS successfully enabled monitoring of GJC in several cultured cell lines under physiologically relevant conditions and in distinct genetically defined neurons in Drosophila brain, with ~10 s temporal resolution and sub-cellular spatial resolution. These results demonstrate that PARIS is a robust, highly sensitive tool for mapping functional gap junctions and study their regulation in both health and disease.  Gap junctions are intercellular channels that are expressed in virtually all tissue types in both vertebrates and invertebrates. They allow direct transfer of small molecules such as ions, metabolites and second messengers between connected cells, thereby playing essential roles in various physiological processes, including embryo development, metabolic coordination of avascular organs, tissue homeostasis and synchronizing electrical activity in excitable tissues ( Bennett and Zukin, 2004; Kumar and Gilula, 1996 ). Defects of gap junction function are linked with a wide array of diseases, including myocardial infarction, hearing loss and hypomyelinating disorder ( Jongsma and Wilders, 2000; Laird, 2010; S\u00f6hl et al., 2005 ). Studying gap junction coupling ( GJC ) under physiological or disease conditions in complex systems such as the nervous system requires a non-invasive method with both cell-type specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Current methods used to monitor GJC include paired electrophysiological recordings ( Bennett et al., 1963; Furshpan and Potter, 1959 ), dye microinjection ( Stewart, 1978 ), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) ( Wade et al., 1986 ), and local activation of molecular fluorescent probes ( LAMP ) ( Dakin et al., 2005 ), all of which are either invasive and/or lack cell-type specificity, thus limiting their use in heterogeneous tissues. Recently, hybrid approaches have been developed in which genetically encoded hydrolytic enzymes or promiscuous transporters are used to introduce small molecule substrates or peptides tagged with a fluorescent label in specific cells ( Qiao and Sanes, 2015; Tian et al., 2012 ). Although these methods might provide cell-type-specific investigation of GJC, the requirement of exogenous substrate and the background generated by endogenous enzymes or transporters still make them difficult to apply in vivo. In addition, dye diffusion is an irreversible process and thus these methods are difficult to be applied to examine the same gap junctions repeatedly in order to measure their dynamics, regulations and plasticity ( Dong et al., 2018 ). To overcome these limitations, we developed an all-optical approach named PARIS ( pairing actuators and receivers to optically isolate gap junctions ) in which we express an optically\u00a0controlled actuator in one cell, to generate an electrochemical gradient of specific molecules between two connected cells, and a fluorescent receiver in the adjacent cell, to detect the movement of the molecules across the gap junctions. GJC between the actuator cell ( i. e. expressing actuators ) and the receiver cell ( i. e. expressing receivers ) is detected by a fluorescence increase in the receiver following the optical activation of the actuator ( Figure 1A ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: For the tissues and organs of our bodies to work properly, the cells within them need to communicate with each other. One important part of cellular communication is the movement of signals \u2013 usually small molecules or ions \u2013 directly from one cell to another. This happens via structures called gap junctions, a type of sealed \u2018channel\u2019 that connects two cells. Gap junctions are found throughout the body, but investigating their precise roles in health and disease has been difficult. This is due to problems with the tools available to detect and monitor gap junctions. Some are simply harmful to cells, while others cannot be restricted to specific cell populations within a tissue. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to study gap junctions in the brain, where it is important to understand the connectivity patterns between distinct types of nerve cells. Wu et al. wanted to develop a new, non-harmful method to track gap junctions in distinct groups of cells within living tissues. To do this, Wu et al. devised PARIS, a two-part, genetically encoded system. The first part comprises a light-sensitive molecular \u2018pump\u2019, which can only be turned on by shining a laser onto the cell of interest. When the pump is active, it transports hydrogen ions out of the cell. The second part of the system is a fluorescent sensor, present inside \u2018receiving\u2019 cells, which responds to the outcoming hydrogen ions ( small enough to pass through gap junctions ). If an illuminated \u2018signaling\u2019 cell is connected via gap junctions to cells containing the fluorescent sensor, they will light up within seconds, but other cells not connected through gap junctions will not. The researchers first tested PARIS in cultured human and rat cells that had been genetically engineered to produce both components of the system. The experiments confirmed that PARIS could both detect networks of gap junctions in healthy cells and reveal when these networks had been disrupted, for instance by drugs or genetic mutations. Experiments using fruit flies demonstrated that PARIS was stable in living tissue and could also map the gap junctions connecting specific groups of nerve cells. PARIS is a valuable addition to the toolbox available to study cell communication. In the future, it could help increase our understanding of diseases characterized by defective gap junctions, such as seizures, cardiac irregularities, and even some cancers ."}

However, little is known about the involvement of mC in response to environmental cues. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of mC in rice grown under phosphate starvation and recovery conditions, we identified widespread phosphate starvation-induced changes in mC, preferentially localized in transposable elements ( TEs ) close to highly induced genes. These changes in mC occurred after changes in nearby gene transcription, were mostly DCL3a-independent, and could partially be propagated through mitosis, however no evidence of meiotic transmission was observed. Similar analyses performed in Arabidopsis revealed a very limited effect of phosphate starvation on mC, suggesting a species-specific mechanism. Overall, this suggests that TEs in proximity to environmentally induced genes are silenced via hypermethylation, and establishes the temporal hierarchy of transcriptional and epigenomic changes in response to stress.  Phosphorus ( P ) is one of the most important macronutrients for all living organisms, being a key component of nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids, as well as being an essential element for energy-mediated metabolic processes. Plants preferentially absorb this nutrient as inorganic phosphate ( Pi ), a form of P with low availability and mobility in the soil ( Poirier and Bucher, 2002 ). As a consequence, Pi is one of the most limiting nutrients for plant growth and development in most agricultural soils. To overcome these issues, application of large quantities of Pi fertilizers has been the primary strategy to maintain crop yields. Yet, this approach is increasingly economically and environmentally unsustainable, with the reserves of Pi rocks greatly diminishing. It is therefore critical to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in Pi homeostasis in order to generate plants with increased P acquisition and use efficiency, associated with sustained yields that will contribute to improve global food security. Plants have developed a wide set of sophisticated responses aimed at acquiring and utilizing Pi efficiently in order to maintain cellular Pi homeostasis even under Pi limiting conditions ( \u2212Pi ) ( Rouached et al., 2010; Chiou and Lin, 2011; Peret et al., 2011 ). In \u2212Pi, the expression level of genes encoding high affinity Pi transporters ( PTs ) in the roots increases in order to increase Pi uptake, as well as inducing and secreting acid phosphatases and ribonucleases to mobilize organically bound P. In contrast, the levels of P-containing intermediates such as nucleotides, RNA and phospholipids are dramatically reduced under \u2212Pi, with phospholipids being replaced with sulpho- and galactolipids. As a consequence, genes involved in sulpho- and galactolipids synthesis, such as sulpholipid synthases ( SQDs ) and monogalactosyl diacylglycerol synthases ( MGDs ) are highly up-regulated in \u2212Pi conditions ( Misson et al., 2005; Secco et al., 2013a ). Members of the SPX-domain containing protein family ( e. g., SPX, PHO1 and NLA ) have also been shown to be key regulators of Pi homeostasis, being involved in Pi transport and signaling ( Wang et al., 2009; Rouached et al., 2010; Kant et al., 2011; Secco et al., 2012; Secco et al., 2013a; Puga et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014 ). In addition to the complex regulation observed at the transcriptome level, studies have shown that Pi homeostasis is also regulated by several post-transcriptional mechanisms involving non-coding RNAs, such as miR827, miR399 and IPS1 ( Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007; Chiou and Lin, 2011 ) as well as post-translational changes ( Bayle et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2013; Park et al., 2014 ). However, only a limited number of studies have assessed the potential involvement of altered DNA or histone modifications in response to Pi starvation, and stresses in general ( Sahu et al., 2013 ). Smith and colleagues previously reported that in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) the histone variant H2A. Z was deposited at a number of Pi starvation-induced ( PSI ) genes and that a loss H2A. Z resulted with their de-repression ( Smith et al., 2010 ). In addition, using low resolution, non-quantitative and locus-specific methods, several studies have shown the potential involvement of altered DNA methylation in response to stresses ( Labra et al., 2002; Chinnusamy and Zhu, 2009; Wang et al., 2011a, 2011b; Karan et al., 2012; Chen and Zhou, 2013; Sahu et al., 2013 ). Deep sequencing technologies now enable whole genome single base resolution analysis of DNA methylation ( Cokus et al., 2008; Lister et al., 2008 ), thus enabling global assessment of changes in DNA methylation in response to environmental and developmental cues. Indeed, Dowen et al. ( 2012 ) previously reported that biotic stress could induce dynamic changes in DNA methylation of repetitive sequences or transposons, often coupled to transcriptional changes of neighbouring genes ( Dowen et al., 2012 ). In addition, Zhong et al. ( 2013 ) recently reported that changes in DNA methylation patterns play a role in the process of tomato fruit ripening ( Zhong et al., 2013 ). Cytosine DNA methylation ( mC ) is involved in a range of important biological processes, including silencing of repetitive sequences and transposable elements ( TEs ), genomic imprinting, and stable gene silencing. In plants, DNA methylation exists in all sequence contexts ( CG, CHG, CHH, where H = A, C or T ) through the activity of multiple genetically distinct pathways ( Law and Jacobsen, 2010; Matzke and Mosher, 2014; Mirouze and Vitte, 2014 ). De novo DNA methylation is mediated by the RNA-directed DNA methylation ( RdDM ) pathways. In the canonical RdDM pathway, transcripts produced from the RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ) are then copied into dsRNAs by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RDR2 ) before being processed into 24-nucleotides ( nt ) small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) by DICER-LIKE 3 ( DCL3 ). These newly generated siRNAs are then loaded onto ARGONAUTE 4 ( AGO4 ) before being guided towards the nascent scaffold of RNAs transcribed by the RNA polymerase V ( Pol V ) through sequence complementarity. Finally, this complex recruits the DNA methyltransferase DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 ( DRM2 ) to perform de novo methylation in all sequence contexts ( Matzke and Mosher, 2014 ). Recently, another RdDM pathway, which is independent of Pol IV and DCL3, has been identified and is referred to as RDR6-RdDM ( Nuthikattu et al., 2013; Panda and Slotkin, 2013; Creasey et al., 2014; Matzke and Mosher, 2014; Bond and Baulcombe, 2015 ). In this pathway, Pol II derived transcripts are copied by RDR6 into dsRNAs before being processed into 21-22-nt siRNAs by DCL2 and DCL4. These siRNAs can then either induce post-transcriptional gene silencing ( PTGS ) when loaded onto AGO1 or initiate de novo DNA methylation when associated with AGO2, thus ultimately triggering the canonical RdDM pathway. Maintenance of DNA methylation through replication is mediated by METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 ( MET1 ) and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 ( CMT3 ) methyltransferases in the CG and CHG contexts, respectively, and are thus referred to as symmetrical methylation, while methylation in the non-symmetrical CHH context has to be established de novo after DNA replication and involves the activities of the DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 and 2 ( DRM1/DRM2 ) and CMT2 methyltransferases ( Finnegan et al., 1996; Du et al., 2012; Zemach et al., 2013 ). Within the plant species studied to date, the general methylation state of particular genomic features are relatively conserved, with TEs often highly methylated in all contexts, and CG methylation commonly located in gene bodies ( Feng et al., 2010; Zemach et al., 2010; Mirouze and Vitte, 2014 ). However, large differences in global DNA methylation levels can be observed amongst plant species potentially associated with different TE content in the various plant genomes. Indeed, the TE-rich genome ( \u223c40% ) of rice has a much higher aggregate level of DNA methylation than the TE-poor ( \u223c15% ) Arabidopsis genome ( Li et al., 2012; Ragupathy et al., 2013; Mirouze and Vitte, 2014 ). Given the paucity of past studies assessing the impact of abiotic stresses upon the plant DNA methylome and the temporal relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional changes, we performed a comprehensive spatio-temporal assessment of the impact of limiting a central plant macronutrient, Pi, upon DNA methylation patterns and transcription, in rice ( Oryza sativa ) and Arabidopsis. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, we identified species-specific, widespread and mitotically heritable changes in DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation that are particularly enriched at stress responsive genes. These changes in DNA methylation occur after changes in nearby gene expression, and are thus likely a consequence of induced transcription of nearby Pi responsive genes, as well as being largely independent of DCL3a. Altogether, we demonstrate a species-specific process in which Pi starvation causes highly localized changes in the genomic DNA methylation patterns in rice, which may act to repress the potentially deleterious activity of TEs located near genes that are highly induced upon stress.

This chemical group forms part of the backbone of DNA molecules, and has a crucial role in many chemical reactions that occur inside cells. Plants in particular need a source of phosphate to grow. This is why agricultural fertilizers are rich in phosphate, but unfortunately, the use of fertilizers is not sustainable. Many researchers are now looking for new ways to maintain high crop yields without chemical fertilizers, and understanding how crops are affected in times of shortage will be pivotal to achieving this goal. DNA contains coded information in the form of genes, which can either be switched on or off. Chemical marks added to the DNA can earmark genes for activation or inactivation, a bit like handwritten annotations in an instruction manual. One example is the addition of a chemical tag called a methyl group to one of the letters of the DNA code\u2014so-called \u2018cytosine methylation\u2019. However, little is known about how the pattern of these chemical marks on DNA changes in response to changes in the environment. Secco et al. investigated changes in cytosine methylation in both rice and Arabidopsis plants that had been deprived of phosphate. Arabidopsis, or thale cress, is a model plant that is often studied by plant biologists because it is small and grows quickly. The experiments showed that when rice plants were not given enough phosphate, the pattern of DNA methylation changed. This was particularly true around certain genes that help the plants survive in these difficult conditions. Notably, in the absence of phosphate, methylation also occurs more often in DNA sequences called transposable elements that sit close to these useful genes, and less often around other genes. Transposable elements, also known as \u2018jumping genes\u2019 can move within the genome and thus potentially have damaging effects through altering the DNA sequence. However, DNA methylation normally prevents this from happening. Therefore, the extra methylation observed by Secco et al. may be a cautionary measure to inactivate these transposable elements and limit their potential deleterious effects. Further experiments went on to show that these useful genes seem to be switched on before the DNA of these transposable elements is methylated, implying that the extra methylation observed in these transposable elements is a consequence of the activation of these nearby useful genes. By contrast, similar experiments performed in Arabidopsis reveal a very limited change in DNA methylation when the plants are grown under stressful conditions. This might be because Arabidopsis has considerably fewer transposable elements than rice. The next challenge will be to explore how significant the environmentally induced silencing of transposable elements is to the stress responses and genome integrity of crop plants ."}

In this study, we explored the role of the mechanical properties of the underlying matrix in the regulation of CM maturation. We show that rat and mouse neonatal CMs cultured on rigid surfaces exhibited increased myofibrillar organization, spread morphology, and reduced cell cycle activity. In contrast, compliant elastic matrices induced features of CM dedifferentiation, including a disorganized sarcomere network, rounding, and conspicuous cell-cycle re-entry. The rigid matrix facilitated nuclear division ( karyokinesis ) leading to binucleation, while compliant matrices promoted CM mitotic rounding and cell division ( cytokinesis ), associated with loss of differentiation markers. Moreover, the compliant matrix potentiated clonal expansion of CMs that involves multiple cell divisions. Thus, the compliant microenvironment facilitates CM dedifferentiation and proliferation via its effect on the organization of the myoskeleton. Our findings may be exploited to design new cardiac regenerative approaches.  During the early postnatal period, cardiomyocytes ( CMs ) undergo a switch from a proliferative, hyperplastic mode to non-proliferative, hypertrophic growth that persists throughout life ( Li et al., 1996; Soonpaa et al., 1996; Soonpaa and Field, 1998 ). This process is accompanied by multiple, highly synchronized cellular changes. The expression of cell-cycle and embryonic markers falls precipitously in CMs ( Walsh et al., 2010 ), while the expression of CM differentiation genes increases, along with the appearance of sarcomeres, contractile units that undergo cross-striation to form a functional myoskeletal system within CMs. Further, mechanical and electrical cell-to-cell communication between CMs is established via intercalated discs, containing gap junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes ( Noorman et al., 2009; Sheikh et al., 2009 ). In parallel, up-regulation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components, as well as increased cross-linking of matrix proteins, also occurs postnatally, leading to an overall stiffening of the heart tissue ( Janmey and Miller, 2011; Swift et al., 2013; Majkut et al., 2014 ). The mechanisms whereby these complex developmental processes are regulated and coordinated, and their putative effects on CM maturation, are yet enigmatic. Over the first week of postnatal life in mice, most CMs exit the cell cycle and differentiate ( Soonpaa et al., 1996 ), although some CMs undergo an additional burst of proliferation in the pre-adolescent period, driven by the thyroid hormone ( Naqvi et al., 2014 ). Mammalian CMs display distinct cycling phases: a fetal/neonatal phase in which nuclear division ( karyokinesis ) is immediately followed by cell division ( cytokinesis ), and a later neonatal phase, in which karyokinesis proceeds without cytokinesis, leading to binucleation ( Soonpaa et al., 1996; Li et al., 1997a, 1997b; Zebrowski and Engel, 2013 ). Binucleation, hypertrophic growth, increased myofibrillar organization, and cell cycle withdrawal are all manifestations of the differentiated state of adult CMs ( Ahuja et al., 2007; Naqvi et al., 2009; Zebrowski and Engel, 2013 ), while the \u2018terminal differentiation\u2019 state is yet uncertain. Naturally, there are physiological advantages in the postnatal maturation of CMs. Nonetheless, loss of the proliferative potential of differentiated CMs creates a major barrier to cardiac regeneration after injury. In humans, myocardial infarction ( MI ) is a life-threatening disease leading to permanent loss of hundreds of millions of CMs, followed by an inflammatory response and formation of scar tissue, that progressively lead to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure ( Virag and Murry, 2003; Ausoni and Sartore, 2009 ). Cardiac regeneration does exist in lower vertebrates such as newts and fish. The zebrafish heart, for example, is able to fully regenerate after injury, without scarring ( Poss et al., 2002 ). The lack of regenerative potential of the mammalian heart was challenged by Porrello and colleagues ( Porrello et al., 2011 ), who showed that the neonatal murine heart displays a transient regenerative phase that diminishes within the first week after birth. Both mammalian and zebrafish heart regeneration is characterized by increased CM proliferation associated with sarcomere disassembly, attributed to a CM dedifferentiation process ( Poss, 2007; Jopling et al., 2010, 2011; Porrello et al., 2011 ). Recent studies with diverse cell types indicate that the rigidity of the underlying ( or surrounding ) matrix strongly influences cell structure, cytoskeletal organization, migration, polarization, and regulation of gene expression and cell fate ( Pelham and Wang, 1997; Discher et al., 2005; Engler et al., 2006; Vogel and Sheetz, 2006; Engler et al., 2008; Geiger et al., 2009; Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2011; Shin et al., 2011 ). In particular, it was demonstrated that interaction with rigid surfaces ( hundreds of kPa and stiffer ) promotes the formation of large, integrin-mediated adhesions, and consequently, development of a well-organized and polarized cytoskeleton ( Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2011 ). Following this logic, we tested here the hypothesis that the decline in CM proliferative and regenerative capacities can be attributed to changes in the mechanical properties of the pericellular environment, which facilitate the assembly of a tightly organized myoskeletal structure. We hypothesize that matrix stiffening, which occurs in the heart after birth, and even more so following MI, is part of a mechanism that blocks CM cell cycle activity. In this study, we discovered that soft matrices promote CM dedifferentiation, as evidenced by CM rounding, myofibrillar disassembly, increased CM cell division, and clonal expansion. In contrast, a rigid matrix facilitates CM differentiation, characterized by tightly packed arrays of long and aligned sarcomeric bundles, cell cycle arrest, and binucleation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that matrix rigidity specifically affects CM cytokinesis, but not karyokinesis. We next demonstrated that disruption of the highly organized architecture of the CM myoskeleton, using the myosin-II inhibitor blebbistatin, induced CM cell cycle re-entry. We suggest that the mechanical properties of the postnatal heart play a key role in the acquisition of the fully differentiated phenotype, and inhibition of the specialized contractile system in CMs could be used to promote CM dedifferentiation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Heart muscle contracts and relaxes in a regular rhythm to pump blood around the body. Soon after birth, the cells that form our heart muscle stop multiplying. As we grow, these cells increase in size and their internal skeleton\u2014called myoskeleton\u2014becomes more complex, to withstand the demands of pumping more blood. However, because the cells can no longer divide, the body is unable to replace heart muscle cells that are damaged by a heart attack or other illness. This lack of ability to regenerate heart muscle is a major challenge for medicine. While researchers have documented many of the changes that occur in heart muscle cells ( known as cardiomyocytes ) after birth, it is not known exactly what triggers these changes. A network of proteins and other molecules\u2014also known as a matrix\u2014surrounds the cardiomyocytes and affects their behavior. Here, Yahalom-Ronen et al. investigated the degree to which the mechanical properties of this matrix affect the ability of cardiomyocytes to divide. In the experiments, cardiomyocytes from newborn rodents were grown on matrices with different rigidities. The cells grown on rigid matrices stopped dividing and became larger with a more robust myoskeleton. These cells also contained two nuclei, which indicates that these cells have become mature cardiomyoctyes. In contrast, heart cells grown on a softer matrix continued to multiply. These cells also began to lose some of the features that distinguish mature cardiomyocytes from the cardiomyocytes found in embryos. Next, Yahalom-Ronen et al. treated the cardiomyoctes with a drug that stops them from contracting, which led to increases in cell multiplication. Yahalom-Ronen et al. 's findings suggest that the stiffness of the matrix that surrounds heart muscle cells regulates their ability to divide and mature. In the future, these findings may pave the way towards the development of soft scaffolds that can stimulate the regeneration of adult human heart ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) and osteolineage cells contribute to the hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) niche in the bone marrow of long bones. However, their developmental relationships remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that different MSC populations in the developing marrow of long bones have distinct functions. Proliferative mesoderm-derived nestin\u2212 MSCs participate in fetal skeletogenesis and lose MSC activity soon after birth. In contrast, quiescent neural crest-derived nestin+ cells preserve MSC activity, but do not generate fetal chondrocytes. Instead, they differentiate into HSC niche-forming MSCs, helping to establish the HSC niche by secreting Cxcl12. Perineural migration of these cells to the bone marrow requires the ErbB3 receptor. The neonatal Nestin-GFP+ Pdgfr\u03b1\u2212 cell population also contains Schwann cell precursors, but does not comprise mature Schwann cells. Thus, in the developing bone marrow HSC niche-forming MSCs share a common origin with sympathetic peripheral neurons and glial cells, and ontogenically distinct MSCs have non-overlapping functions in endochondrogenesis and HSC niche formation.  Bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs ) are a heterogeneous population. The different mesenchymal cell types might either arise from a variety of resident progenitors or might ultimately be derived from a single population of rare MSCs ( Caplan, 1991 ). In adult mammals, a multiple origin of skeletal MSCs is suggested by the distinct germ layer derivation of different bone structures, with craniofacial bones generated by the neuroectoderm, whereas the axial and appendicular bones are respectively derived from paraxial and lateral mesoderm. Mesoderm generates chondrocytes, which are progressively replaced by osteoblasts through the process of endochondral ossification ( Olsen et al., 2000 ). MSCs share cell-surface markers and localization with pericytes, suggesting that some pericytes might be MSCs ( Crisan et al., 2008 ). However, it remains unclear whether the bone marrow hosts ontogenically distinct MSCs in the same bones and whether they are endowed with specific functions. In adult bone marrow, a variety of mesenchymal cells regulate HSCs ( Calvi et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003; Arai et al., 2004; Sacchetti et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2008; Naveiras et al., 2009; Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010; Omatsu et al., 2010; Raaijmakers et al., 2010 ). Nevertheless, the specialized functions and developmental origin of these cells are largely unknown. Adult HSCs are also regulated by certain other non-hematopoietic lineages, including endothelial cells ( Avecilla et al., 2004; Kiel et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2012 ), sympathetic neurons and associated non-myelinating Schwann cells ( Katayama et al., 2006; Spiegel et al., 2007; Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2008; Yamazaki et al., 2011 ), perivascular cells expressing the leptin receptor ( Ding et al., 2012 ) and mesodermal derivatives ( Greenbaum et al., 2013 ). However, the relationships and potential overlap among these populations remain unclear. It is also not known whether MSCs that form the HSC niche also generate other stromal cells or are a specialized population that arises earlier in embryogenesis and persists into adulthood. In this study, we investigated the developmental origin and functions of MSCs in the primordial marrow of long bones. We show that, like peripheral neural and glial cells, HSC niche-forming MSCs in perinatal bone marrow arise from the trunk neural crest and make only a modest contribution to endochondrogenesis. Thus, whereas mesoderm-derived MSCs are mostly involved in endochondral ossification, neural crest-derived cells have a specialized function in establishing the HSC niche in the developing marrow of the same bones. These results provide compelling evidence for functional segregation of MSCs derived from different germ layers. The data also show that three HSC niche components\u2014peripheral sympathetic neurons, Schwann cells, and MSCs\u2014share a common origin.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: During the earliest phases of development, the embryo is formed by groups of stem cells that can develop into all the different types of tissue in the body\u2014from bones to brain tissue. Later in life, small stockpiles of adult stem cells are found in various tissues and provide a reservoir of new cells available for replacing old or damaged cells. The most important source of blood stem cells is the bone marrow, which produces and stores cells that are capable of developing into blood and immune system cells. These processes are assisted by different bone marrow cells called stromal cells, which create a specialized local environment or \u2018niche\u2019. But are the stromal stem cells that form the skeleton the same ones that form this niche during development ? Or do the various types of stromal stem cells develop from distinct groups of cells in the embryo ? Furthermore, it is unclear which cells guide blood stem cells towards the forming bones. Other types of cells, including some of the cells of the nervous system, can communicate with the stem cells in the adult marrow and influence their behavior. This led scientists to wonder whether the stem cells in the bone marrow niche and the cells that communicate with them developed from the same type of embryonic stem cell. Isern et al. tracked down the developmental origins of different types of bone marrow stromal stem cells by examining the bone marrow from the long bones ( for example, the bones in the leg ) of unborn and infant mice. It turns out that not all stromal stem cells in the developing bone marrow are alike. In fact, one pool of stromal stem cells forms the skeleton and loses stem cell activity in the process. In contrast, a different population of stromal stem cells develops from the same group of embryonic cells that gives rise to the cells of the nervous system. The stromal stem cells in this second group function as a niche to recruit and store the incoming blood stem cells and retain their stem cell activity throughout life. The findings of Isern et al. help to explain why the nervous system is able to communicate with stem cells in the adult marrow, and provide a model for understanding how stem cell niches in organs that contain nerve tissue are established ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMany recent models study the downstream projection from grid cells to place cells, while recent data have pointed out the importance of the feedback projection. We thus asked how grid cells are affected by the nature of the input from the place cells. We propose a single-layer neural network with feedforward weights connecting place-like input cells to grid cell outputs. Place-to-grid weights are learned via a generalized Hebbian rule. The architecture of this network highly resembles neural networks used to perform Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ). Both numerical results and analytic considerations indicate that if the components of the feedforward neural network are non-negative, the output converges to a hexagonal lattice. Without the non-negativity constraint, the output converges to a square lattice. Consistent with experiments, grid spacing ratio between the first two consecutive modules is \u22121. 4. Our results express a possible linkage between place cell to grid cell interactions and PCA.  The system of spatial navigation in the brain has recently received much attention ( Burgess, 2014; Morris, 2015; Eichenbaum, 2015 ). This system involves many regions, which seem to divide into two major classes: regions such as CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus, which contain place cells ( O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978 ), vs. regions, such as the medial-entorhinal cortex ( MEC ), the presubiculum and the parasubiculum, which contain grid cells, head-direction cells and border cells ( Hafting et al., 2005; Boccara et al., 2010; Sargolini et al., 2006; Solstad et al., 2008; Savelli et al., 2008 ). While the phenomenology of those cells is described in many studies ( Derdikman and Knierim, 2014; Tocker et al., 2015 ), the manner in which grid cells are formed is quite enigmatic. Many mechanisms have been proposed. The details of these mechanisms differ, however, they mostly share in common the assumption that the animal\u2019s velocity is the main input to the system ( Derdikman and Knierim, 2014; Zilli, 2012; Giocomo et al., 2011 ), such that positional information is generated by the\u00a0integration of this input in time. This process is termed 'path integration' ( PI ) ( Mittelstaedt and Mittelstaedt, 1980 ). A notable exception to this class of models was suggested in a previous\u00a0paper by\u00a0Kropff and Treves ( 2008 ) ; and in a sequel to that paper ( Si and Treves, 2013 ), in which they demonstrated the emergence of grid cells from place cell inputs without using the rat's velocity as an input signal. We note here that generating grid cells from place cells may seem at odds with the architecture of the network, since it is known that place cells reside at least one synapse downstream of grid cells ( Witter and Amaral, 2004 ). Nonetheless, there is current evidence that the feedback from place cells to grid cells is of great functional importance. Specifically, there is evidence that inactivation of place cells causes grid cells to disappear ( Bonnevie et al., 2013 ), and furthermore, it seems that, in development, place cells emerge before grid cells do ( Langston et al., 2010; Wills et al., 2010 ). Thus, there is good motivation for trying to understand how the feedback from hippocampal place cells may contribute to grid cell formation. In the present paper, we thus investigated a model of grid cell development from place cell inputs. We showed the resemblance between a feedforward network from place cells to grid cells to a neural network architecture previously used to implement the PCA algorithm ( Oja, 1982 ). We demonstrated, both analytically and through simulations, that the formation of grid cells from place cells using such a neural network could occur given specific assumptions on the input ( i. e. zero mean ) and on the nature of the feedforward connections ( specifically, non-negative, or excitatory ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Long before the invention of GPS systems, ships used a technique called dead reckoning to navigate at sea. By tracking the ship\u2019s speed and direction of movement away from a starting point, the crew could estimate their position at any given time. Many believe that some animals, including rats and humans, can use a similar process to navigate in the absence of external landmarks. This process is referred to as \u201cpath integration\u201d. It is commonly believed that the brain\u2019s navigation system is based on such path integration in two key regions: the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. Most models of navigation assume that a network of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex processes information about an animal\u2019s speed and direction of movement. The grid cell network estimates the animal\u2019s future position and relays this information to cells in the hippocampus called place cells. Individual place cells then fire whenever the animal reaches a specific location. However, recent work has shown that information also flows from place cells back to grid cells. Further experiments have suggested that place cells develop before grid cells. Also, inactivating place cells eliminates the hexagonal patterns that normally appear in the activity of the grid cells. Using a computational model, Dordek, Soudry et al. now show that place cell activity could in principle trigger the formation of the grid cell network, rather than vice versa. This is achieved using a process that resembles a common statistical algorithm called principal component analysis ( PCA ). However, this only works if place cells only excite grid cells and never inhibit their activity, similar to what is known from the anatomy of these brain regions. Under these circumstances, the model shows hexagonal patterns emerging in the activity of the grid cells, with similar properties to those patterns observed experimentally. These results suggest that navigation may not depend solely on grid cells processing information about speed and direction of movement, as assumed by path integration models. Instead grid cells may rely on position-based input from place cells. The next step is to create a single model that combines the flow of information from place cells to grid cells and vice versa ."}

La-related protein-4 ( LARP4 ) binds poly ( A ) and PABP. LARP4 mRNA contains a translation-dependent, coding region determinant ( CRD ) of instability that limits its expression. Although the CRD comprises <10% of LARP4 codons, the mRNA levels vary >20 fold with synonymous CRD substitutions that accommodate tRNA dynamics. Separately, overexpression of the most limiting tRNA increases LARP4 levels and reveals its functional activity, net lengthening of the PATs of heterologous mRNAs with concomitant stabilization, including ribosomal protein ( RP ) mRNAs. Genetic deletion of cellular LARP4 decreases PAT length and RPmRNA stability. This LARP4 activity requires its PABP-interaction domain and the RNA-binding module which we show is sensitive to poly ( A ) 3'-termini, consistent with protection from deadenylation. The results indicate that LARP4 is a posttranscriptional regulator of ribosomal protein production in mammalian cells and suggest that this activity can be controlled by tRNA levels.  A key control element of the stability and translatability of eukaryotic mRNA is the 3' poly ( A ) tail ( PAT ) which can vary from\u00a0~25 to 250 nucleotides ( Mangus et al., 2003; Eliseeva et al., 2013 ), and accommodate multiple molecules of PABP ( Baer and Kornberg, 1980 ). PAT length is associated with translation efficiency in early development ( Subtelny et al., 2014 ), and for specific mRNAs in somatic cells ( Park et al., 2016 ). PABP interacts with multiple different proteins involved in mRNA translation and stability ( Mangus et al., 2003; Ivanov et al., 2016 ). Several of these proteins, among which are key factors involved in mRNA 3' exonucleolytic deadenylation, translation initiation and termination, share a similar peptide sequence termed PAM2 that interacts with the C-terminal domain of PABP ( Xie et al., 2014 ). Some proteins with a PAM2 sequence including Paips 1 and 2, LARPs 1, 4 and 4B, also harbor other regions that interact with PABP ( Yang et al., 2011; Tcherkezian et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2014; Fonseca et al., 2015 ). LARPs 1, 4 and 4B associate with translating polyribosomes ( Sch\u00e4ffler et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011; Tcherkezian et al., 2014; Fonseca et al., 2015 ). The 'La module' of the eukaryote-ubiquitous nuclear La protein is comprised of a La motif ( LaM ) followed by an RNA recognition motif ( RRM ) that cooperate to form a RNA binding pocket that recognizes the extreme UUU-3'OH termini of RNA polymerase III transcripts and protects them from 3' exonucleases ( Bayfield et al., 2010 ). The La module has been highly conserved by a few distinct La-related proteins ( LARPs ) that arose during eukaryotic evolution but diverged in other features of their structure and function ( Bousquet-Antonelli and Deragon, 2009; Maraia et al., 2017 ). Of these, LARPs 1, 4, 4B and 6 are mostly cytoplasmic and associated with mRNAs ( Maraia et al., 2017 ). Yet, except for vertebrate LARP6 which binds a highly conserved stem-bulge-loop found in the 5' UTRs of three \u03b1-collagen mRNAs ( Cai et al., 2010; Martino et al., 2015; Zhang and Stefanovic, 2016 ), details of RNA binding by the La modules of LARPs 1, 4 and 4B, and how such binding may contribute to their activities are largely unknown ( Maraia et al., 2017 ). The La module-containing N-terminal domain of LARP4 has been shown to bind homopoly ( A ) whereas its full length homolog, LARP4B has been shown to bind A-rich, U-containing RNA ( Yang et al., 2011; K\u00fcspert et al., 2015 ), consistent with key differences in their La motifs ( Bayfield et al., 2010; Maraia et al., 2017 ) ; their regulation also differs since LARP4 but not 4B mRNA is destabilized by TTP ( Mattijssen and Maraia, 2015 ). LARP1 appears to bind poly ( A ) and to stabilize mRNAs containing the 5' terminal oligo pyrimidine ( 5'TOP ) motif ( Aoki et al., 2013 ) which are comprised of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins ( RP ), translation factors, PABP and other proteins ( Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015 ). LARP1 is known to have two RNA-binding domains, a La module in its N-terminal half ( Nykamp et al., 2008 ) and a C-terminal HEAT motif that directly binds the 5' m7G cap and pyrimidine tract of the 5'TOP motif ( Lahr et al., 2017 ). LARP1 may regulate a number of transcripts in addition to the 5'TOP mRNAs ( Blagden et al., 2009; Tcherkezian et al., 2014; Fonseca et al., 2015; Mura et al., 2015 ). Coding region determinants ( CRD ) of instability have been found in a small number of mRNAs, including Fos and Myc ( Lemm and Ross, 2002; Chang et al., 2004 ) ( reviewed in Lee and Gorospe, 2011 ) and for Fos involves interactions with PABP, translating ribosomes, and deadenylation ( reviewed in Chen and Shyu, 2011 ). Accumulating evidence indicate that the overall fraction of optimal vs. suboptimal codons in a mRNA is a major determinant of mRNA decay in yeast ( Presnyak et al., 2015 ). A potential link between mRNA codon use and decay appears more complex in higher eukaryotic cells in which the relatively high content of 3\u2032 UTR-destabilizing elements is a confounding issue ( reviewed in Chen and Shyu, 2017 ). Unresolved issues include whether codon optimality plays a role in higher eukaryotes, and if so to what extent and to what degree do cellular tRNA dynamics including relative abundances as well as codon-anticodon restraints such as wobble decoding which slows translation elongation ( Stadler and Fire, 2011 ) vs. direct Watson:Crick ( W:C ) decoding, contribute ( Chen and Shyu, 2017 ). We compared expression in HEK293 cells of the open reading frames ( ORFs ) encoding several proteins and found LARP4 to be uniquely low. Detailed characterization revealed a codon-specific, translation-dependent CRD of mRNA instability that comprises\u00a0<10% of the LARP4 ORF that is a strong determinant of expression. We analyzed the unusual codon characteristics of this CRD and their matches to cellular tRNA levels which we determined for this study. Synonymous substitutions limited only to the CRD including wobble vs. W:C decoding were analyzed for effects on expression of full length LARP4 and correlations with cellular tRNA levels. The synonymous substitutions led to LARP4 expression levels over a\u00a0>20 fold range with excellent correlation with tRNA levels and codon-anticodon restraints ( R2\u00a0=\u00a00. 9 ). Furthermore, mild to modest overexpression of the most limiting cellular tRNA cognate to CRD codons increased LARP4 levels in a dose-dependent manner. For some CRD constructs, this tRNA led to increased LARP4 production without increasing mRNA levels, while for other, more codon-optimized constructs, it increased LARP4 protein as well as the mRNA levels. Increases in LARP4 levels by either synonymous codon swaps or tRNA overexpression revealed its dose-dependent activity to promote longer PATs on heterologous mRNAs with associated stabilization. These results and poly ( A ) binding data that indicate 3' end-specific recognition and suggest protection from deadenylation, point to mechanisms by which LARP4 promotes mRNA stability and potential control of RPmRNA by tRNA levels.

To build a protein, the code within a gene is copied into a molecule called a messenger RNA ( or mRNA short ). The letters of the genetic code are then read in groups of three, referred to as codons, by a molecular machine called a ribosome. Each codon corresponds to one of the building blocks of all proteins, known as amino acids. However, because there are 64 possible codons but only 20 or so amino acids found in proteins, different codons can encode for the same amino acid. In addition to determining the order of amino acids in a protein, the sequence of codons in an mRNA can have other effects too. Some sequences change how the mRNA binds with other molecules, while others affect how long the mRNA will last within the cell before it is broken down. In fact, the stability of an mRNA is an important way to control a gene\u2019s activity and genes that encode unstable mRNAs typically yield less protein. Understanding the full information potential of the DNA code is a major goal of many biologists. Much research in this field has focused on single-celled organisms such as yeast, yet the regulation of mRNAs in yeast is generally less complex than it is in humans. Mattijssen et al. have now asked how codons within the mRNA for a human protein called LARP4 affect the mRNA\u2019s stability. This protein binds to mRNA molecules, and the experiments uncovered a short segment of codons that made the mRNA of LARP4 very unstable. Replacing specific codons in this segment with other codons for the same amino acid caused the stability of the LARP4 mRNA to increase a lot. This in turn changed how much LARP4 protein was produced. Amino acids are brought to their corresponding codons by molecules called transfer RNAs ( or tRNAs for short ). Mattijssen et al. found that the codons in the short segment of LARP4 mRNA that caused instability were matched by rare tRNAs. Increasing the levels of these low level tRNAs also increased how much LARP4 protein was produced. The elevated levels of LARP4 revealed a new activity for the protein. Almost all mRNAs have a so-called poly-A tail at one end, and the experiments showed that LARP4 binds to a range of mRNAs to help make these tails longer, which in turn makes the molecules more stable. Deleting the gene for LARP4 from mouse cells lead otherwise stable mRNAs to have shorter poly ( A ) tails and to become less stable. This includes the mRNAs that code for the proteins that make up ribosomes. The regulation of the mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins has been challenging to understand. These new results may reveal a network of signals that connects the amount of tRNAs in a cell to the production of ribosomes. Since ribosome production is central to controlling cell growth and division, these results may have broad implications in research into areas as varied as human development and cancer ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe serine\u2013threonine kinase AKT regulates proliferation and survival by phosphorylating a network of protein substrates. In this study, we describe a kinase-independent function of AKT. In cancer cells harboring gain-of-function alterations in MET, HER2, or Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase ( PI3K ), catalytically inactive AKT ( K179M ) protected from drug induced cell death in a PH-domain dependent manner. An AKT kinase domain mutant found in human melanoma ( G161V ) lacked enzymatic activity in vitro and in AKT1/AKT2 double knockout cells, but promoted growth factor independent survival of primary human melanocytes. ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors failed to block the kinase-independent function of AKT, a liability that limits their effectiveness compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors. Our results broaden the current view of AKT function and have important implications for the development of AKT inhibitors for cancer.  The serine\u2013threonine kinase AKT is a non-receptor kinase that plays critical roles in growth and metabolism ( Pearce et al., 2010 ). AKT is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, usually due to mutations in upstream components of the Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase ( PI3K ) pathway. AKT signaling is required for tumor maintenance in certain genetic contexts, as has been shown for some cancer cell lines harboring PI3K mutations or amplification of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase ( She et al., 2008 ). Encouraged by these results, several ATP-competitive and allosteric AKT inhibitors have been identified ( Engelman, 2009 ), but optimal strategies for the clinical development of these agents are currently unknown.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: To maintain a healthy body, the ability of our cells to survive and divide is normally strictly controlled. If any cells manage to escape these restrictions, they may rapidly divide and form tumors, which can lead to cancer. A protein called AKT can encourage cells to survive and divide, and in healthy cells it is only allowed to be active at specific times. However, in many cancer cells, the genes that make and control AKT activity can be altered by mutations, which can result in AKT being active at the wrong times. Part of the AKT protein acts as an enzyme called a kinase and adds chemical groups called phosphates to other proteins. The phosphate groups can activate or deactivate these proteins to control cell survival and cell division. However, there are other sections to the AKT protein and it is not clear how they are involved in this protein's activity. In this study, Vivanco et al. show that AKT has another role in cell survival that does not depend on its kinase. The experiments show that even when the kinase part of the protein is missing, AKT can help cancer cells to survive drug treatments and external conditions that would normally kill them. This role requires another section of the protein called the PH-domain. There are several chemicals\u2014called inhibitors\u2014that can stop AKT from working properly, and they have the potential to be used to treat some types of cancer. These inhibitors work in different ways: some were able to block the activity of the kinase, but others inhibited AKT by binding to other parts of the protein. Therefore, to develop AKT inhibitors into effective drugs, it will be important to know precisely what role the protein plays in different types of cancers ."}

Here, we explore this phenomenon in M\u00fcller glia, which are specialized radial astroglia that are the predominant glial type of the vertebrate retina. M\u00fcller glia extend fine filopodia-like processes into retinal synaptic layers, in similar fashion to brain astrocytes and radial glia that exhibit perisynaptic processes. Using two-photon volumetric imaging, we found that during the second postnatal week, M\u00fcller glial processes were highly dynamic, with rapid extensions and retractions that were mediated by cytoskeletal rearrangements. During this same stage of development, retinal waves led to increases in cytosolic calcium within M\u00fcller glial lateral processes and stalks. These regions comprised distinct calcium compartments, distinguished by variable participation in waves, timing, and sensitivity to an M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. However, we found that motility of lateral processes was unaffected by the presence of pharmacological agents that enhanced or blocked wave-associated calcium transients. Finally, we found that mice lacking normal cholinergic waves in the first postnatal week also exhibited normal M\u00fcller glial process morphology. Hence, outgrowth of M\u00fcller glial lateral processes into synaptic layers is determined by factors that are independent of neuronal activity.  Bidirectional signaling between neurons and glia is essential for circuit formation and function throughout the nervous system. Across developmental steps from neurogenesis to circuit maturation, glia monitor their environment and in turn regulate neuronal production, migration, and differentiation, promote synapse turnover, and regulate synaptic function via neurotransmitter uptake and ion buffering ( Allen and Lyons, 2018 ). In the vertebrate retina, for example, M\u00fcller glia exhibit neurogenic potential ( Bernardos et al., 2007; Ji et al., 2017; Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2018 ), promote circuit-specific wiring via secretion of synaptogenic molecules ( Koh et al., 2019 ), regulate phagocytosis of neuronal debris ( Bejarano-Escobar et al., 2017 ), and limit neurotransmitter spillover via transporter activity ( Bringmann et al., 2013 ). There is extensive evidence that neuronal signaling influences glial physiology in the adult brain. Individual astroglia extend fine processes that contact thousands of synapses and express an array of neurotransmitter receptors ( Allen and Eroglu, 2017 ). This enables glia to rapidly integrate neuronal activity, often involving intracellular calcium mobilization. Neuronal activity-evoked calcium events in astroglia range in size from small membrane-proximal microdomains to global cytosolic events mediated by various transmembrane proteins and calcium sources ( Shigetomi et al., 2016; Bindocci et al., 2017; Nimmerjahn and Bergles, 2015 ). Pharmacological studies suggest compartmentalized and global calcium events are mediated by separate mechanisms and evoke different functional responses within astroglia, which lead to differential effects on neurotransmission ( Di Castro et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2020; Srinivasan et al., 2015 ). Here, we use the mouse retina as a model to explore mechanisms and a possible function of neuron-glia signaling during development. In the retina, M\u00fcller glia are the predominant glial type, tiling the entire retinal space and interacting with every retinal cell type ( Wang et al., 2017 ). Similar to Bergmann glia of the cerebellum ( De Zeeuw and Hoogland, 2015; Lippman et al., 2008 ), M\u00fcller glia exhibit a radial structure with a stalk extending from the soma, lateral processes extending from the stalk within synaptic layers, and endfeet contacting neuronal somata, axons, and vasculature. In the adult, this complex morphology enables M\u00fcller glia to mediate neurovascular coupling, maintain pan-retinal ion homeostasis, and modulate neuronal signaling in the adult ( Newman, 2003; Newman, 2015; Reichenbach and Bringmann, 2013 ). During both mouse ( Rosa et al., 2015 ) and zebrafish ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) development, M\u00fcller glia undergo calcium transients in response to retinal waves, a term used to describe spontaneous bursts of depolarization that propagate across the retina. The functional relevance of wave-associated calcium signaling in M\u00fcller glia is not known. One potential role for wave-associated calcium-signaling in M\u00fcller glia is in modulating outgrowth of lateral processes, which initiates and progresses during the same developmental window as retinal waves ( Wang et al., 2017 ). In other brain regions and model systems, neuronal activity-evoked calcium transients lead to morphological changes in astroglial processes. For example, in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex, perisynaptic astrocytic processes undergo spatially localized, glutamate-evoked calcium transients which are essential for activity-evoked ensheathment of synapses ( Bernardinelli et al., 2014 ). In the cerebellum, Bergmann glial processes are highly motile during synaptogenic periods, and their ensheathment of Purkinje cells is impaired when glial glutamate transporters are knocked out ( Lippman et al., 2008; Miyazaki et al., 2017 ). Radial glia of the Xenopus optic tectum exhibit neuronal activity-evoked calcium transients and motility during visual system development ( Sild et al., 2016 ). In many of these systems, when glial motility is blocked, synaptic development, function, and plasticity are impaired ( Van Horn and Ruthazer, 2019 ), highlighting the importance of glial dynamics in setting up and maintaining neural circuits. Here, we combine morphological and calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and pharmacology to characterize M\u00fcller glial lateral process outgrowth during retinal waves and to determine the impact of neuronal activity on M\u00fcller glial morphology.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: When it comes to studying the nervous system, neurons often steal the limelight; yet, they can only work properly thanks to an ensemble cast of cell types whose roles are only just emerging. For example, \u2018glial cells\u2019 \u2013 their name derives from the Greek word for glue \u2013 were once thought to play only a passive, supporting function in nervous tissues. Now, growing evidence shows that they are, in fact, integrated into neural circuits: their activity is influenced by neurons, and, in turn, they help neurons to function properly. The role of glial cells is becoming clear in the retina, the thin, light-sensitive layer that lines the back of the eye and relays visual information to the brain. There, beautifully intricate Mu\u0308ller glial cells display fine protrusions ( or \u2018processes' ) that intermingle with synapses, the busy space between neurons where chemical messengers are exchanged. These messengers can act on M\u00fcller cells, triggering cascades of molecular events that may influence the structure and function of glia. This is of particular interest during development: as M\u00fcller cells mature, they are exposed to chemicals released by more fully formed retinal neurons. Tworig et al. explored how neuronal messengers can influence the way M\u00fcller cells grow their processes. To do so, they tracked mouse retinal glial cells \u2018live\u2019 during development, showing that they were growing fine, highly dynamic processes in a region rich in synapses just as neurons and glia increased their communication. However, using drugs to disrupt this messaging for a short period did not seem to impact how the processes grew. Extending the blockade over a longer timeframe also did not change the way M\u00fcller cells developed, with the cells still acquiring their characteristic elaborate process networks. Taken together, these results suggest that the structural maturation of Mu\u0308ller glial cells is not impacted by neuronal signaling, giving a more refined understanding of how glia form in the retina and potentially in the brain ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A is a member of a conserved protein family that comprises ion channels and lipid scramblases. Although the structure of the scramblase nhTMEM16 has defined the architecture of the family, it was unknown how a channel has adapted to cope with its distinct functional properties. Here we have addressed this question by the structure determination of mouse TMEM16A by cryo-electron microscopy and a complementary functional characterization. The protein shows a similar organization to nhTMEM16, except for changes at the site of catalysis. There, the conformation of transmembrane helices constituting a membrane-spanning furrow that provides a path for lipids in scramblases has changed to form an enclosed aqueous pore that is largely shielded from the membrane. Our study thus reveals the structural basis of anion conduction in a TMEM16 channel and it defines the foundation for the diverse functional behavior in the TMEM16 family.  Calcium-activated chloride channels ( CaCCs ) are important constituents of diverse physiological processes, ranging from epithelial chloride secretion to the control of electrical excitability in smooth muscles and neurons ( Hartzell et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2012; Oh and Jung, 2016; Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014 ). These ligand-gated ion channels are activated upon an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration as a consequence of cellular signaling events. Although CaCC function can be accomplished by unrelated protein architectures ( Kane Dickson et al., 2014, Kunzelmann et al., 2009 ), the so far best-characterized processes are mediated by the protein TMEM16A ( Caputo et al., 2008; Schroeder et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008 ). TMEM16A is a member of the large TMEM16 family of membrane proteins, also known as anoctamins ( Yang et al., 2008 ). The family is exclusively found in eukaryotes and contains 10 paralogs in mammals that all share considerable sequence homology ( Milenkovic et al., 2010 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ). Although it was initially anticipated that all TMEM16 proteins would function as anion channels ( Hartzell et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2008 ), it is now generally accepted that only two family members ( the closely related TMEM16A and B ) are ion channels ( Pifferi et al., 2009; Scudieri et al., 2012 ), whereas most others work as lipid scramblases, which catalyze the passive and bidirectional diffusion of lipids between the two leaflets of a phospholipid bilayer ( Brunner et al., 2016; Malvezzi et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2013, 2010; Whitlock and Hartzell, 2017, 2016 ). The TMEM16 family shows a new protein fold, as revealed by the structure of the fungal homologue nhTMEM16, which functions as lipid scramblase ( Brunner et al., 2014 ). nhTMEM16 consists of structured cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal components and a transmembrane domain ( TMD ) containing 10 transmembrane helices. As general for the TMEM16 family, the protein is a homo-dimer ( Fallah et al., 2011; Sheridan et al., 2011 ) with each subunit containing its own lipid translocation path located at the two opposite corners of a rhombus-shaped protein distant from the dimer interface ( Brunner et al., 2014 ). This lipid path is formed by the \u2018subunit cavity\u2019, a membrane-spanning furrow of appropriate size to harbor a lipid headgroup. Since the subunit cavity is exposed to the membrane, it was proposed that its polar surface provides a favorable environment for lipid headgroups on their way across the membrane, whereas the fatty-acid chains remain embedded in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer ( Brunner et al., 2014 ). In the vicinity of each subunit cavity, within the membrane-embedded domain, a conserved regulatory calcium-binding site controls the activity of the protein ( Brunner et al., 2014 ). In light of the nhTMEM16 structure and the strong sequence conservation within the family, a central open question concerns how the TMEM16A architecture has adapted to account for its altered functional properties. Previous results suggested that the same region constituting the scrambling path also forms the ion conduction pore ( Yang et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2012 ). However, in what way the distinct structural features of a scramblase, which allows the diffusion of a large and amphiphilic substrate, are altered in a channel that facilitates the transmembrane movement of a comparably small and charged anion, remained a matter of controversy. Here we have resolved this controversy by the structure determination of mouse TMEM16A ( mTMEM16A ) by cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) at 6. 6 \u00c5 resolution and a complementary electrophysiological characterization of pore mutants. Our data define the general architecture of a calcium-activated chloride channel of the TMEM16 family and reveal its relationship to the majority of family members working as lipid scramblases. The protein shows a similar overall fold and dimeric organization as the lipid scramblase nhTMEM16. However, conformational rearrangements of helices lining the lipid scrambling path have sealed the subunit cavity, resulting in the formation of a protein-enclosed ion conduction pore that is for most parts shielded from the membrane but that might be partly accessible to lipids on its intracellular side.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cell membranes are made up of two layers of oily molecules, called lipids, embedded with a variety of proteins. Each type of membrane protein carries out a particular activity for the cell, and many are involved in transporting other molecules from one side of the membrane to the other. The TMEM16 proteins are a large family of membrane proteins. Most are known as lipid scramblases and move lipids between the two layers of the membrane. However, some TMEM16 proteins transport ions in or out of the cell, and are instead called ion channels. TMEM16 proteins are found in animals, plants and fungi but not bacteria, and play key roles in many biological activities that keep these organisms alive. For example, in humans, ion channels belonging to the TMEM16 family help keep the lining of the lung moist, and allow muscles in the gut to contract. The structure of a scramblase shows that two protein units interact, with each unit containing a furrow that spans the membrane, through which lipids can move from one layer to the other. However, to date, the shape of a TMEM16 ion channel has not been determined. It was therefore not clear how a protein with features that let it transport large, oily molecules like lipids had evolved to transport small, charged particles instead. TMEM16A is a member of the TMEM16 family that transports negatively charged chloride ions. Using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, Paulino et al. have determined the three-dimensional shape of the version of TMEM16A from a mouse. Overall, TMEM16A is organized similarly to the lipid scramblase. However, some parts of the TMEM16A protein have undergone rearrangements such that the membrane-exposed furrow that provides a path for lipids in scramblases is now partially sealed in TMEM16A. This results in an enclosed pore that is largely shielded from the oily membrane and through which ions can pass. Additionally, biochemical analysis suggests that TMEM16A forms a narrow pore that may widen towards the side facing the inside of the cell, though further work is needed to understand if this is relevant to the protein\u2019s activity. The three-dimensional structure of TMEM16A reveals how the protein\u2019s architecture differs from other family members working as lipid scramblases. It also gives insight into how TMEM16 proteins might work as ion channels. These findings can now form a strong basis for future studies into the activity of TMEM16 proteins ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe essential functions required for mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome biorientation and segregation are not fully understood, despite extensive study. To illuminate the combinations of ingredients most important to align and segregate chromosomes and simultaneously assemble a bipolar spindle, we developed a computational model of fission-yeast mitosis. Robust chromosome biorientation requires progressive restriction of attachment geometry, destabilization of misaligned attachments, and attachment force dependence. Large spindle length fluctuations can occur when the kinetochore-microtubule attachment lifetime is long. The primary spindle force generators are kinesin-5 motors and crosslinkers in early mitosis, while interkinetochore stretch becomes important after biorientation. The same mechanisms that contribute to persistent biorientation lead to segregation of chromosomes to the poles after anaphase onset. This model therefore provides a framework to interrogate key requirements for robust chromosome biorientation, spindle length regulation, and force generation in the spindle.  Cell biology seeks to understand how nanometer-scale molecules organize micron-scale cells, a question well-suited to theory and modeling ( Marshall, 2017 ). As quantitative cell biology has grown, modeling has expanded in scope ( Mogilner et al., 2006 ). Theory and simulation can now predict cellular phenomena across length and time scales, giving new insight into cellular self-organization. In the cytoskeleton, an important challenge is understanding how a relatively small number of building blocks can produce diverse structures and machines. Quantitative modeling has contributed to our understanding of cytoskeletal functions including mitosis ( Mogilner and Craig, 2010; Civelekoglu-Scholey and Cimini, 2014 ), cytokinesis ( Akamatsu et al., 2014; Stachowiak et al., 2014 ), and cell motility ( Allard and Mogilner, 2013; Barnhart et al., 2017 ). Chromosome segregation in eukaryotes is performed by the mitotic spindle, a self-organized microtubule ( MT ) -based machine ( Bray, 2000; McIntosh et al., 2012 ). Dynamic spindle MTs are typically organized with their plus-ends toward the center of the spindle, forming a bipolar array as the spindle poles move apart ( Figure 1;\u00a0Taylor, 1959; McIntosh et al., 2012 ). Motor proteins and crosslinkers that bundle and slide MTs create, extend, and stabilize MT bundles ( Figure 1A, B; Mann and Wadsworth, 2019; Pidoux et al., 1996; Chen et al., 2012; Hepperla et al., 2014; Hueschen et al., 2019; Yamashita et al., 2005; Janson et al., 2007; Braun et al., 2011; Lansky et al., 2015 ). As the spindle assembles, MTs attach to duplicated chromosomes at kinetochores and align them at the spindle midzone ( Figure 1A\u2013C;\u00a0Musacchio and Desai, 2017; Hinshaw and Harrison, 2018; Hamilton et al., 2019 ). Biorientation occurs when sister kinetochores are attached to sister poles, but is often preceded by erroneous attachment ( Figure 1D;\u00a0Cimini et al., 2001; Salmon et al., 2005; Rumpf et al., 2010; Gregan et al., 2011; Lampson and Grishchuk, 2017 ). Kinetochores therefore perform multiple functions: they link chromosomes to MTs, maintain attachment to MT ends under force and as MTs grow and shrink, sense MT attachment and tension between sisters, and regulate correction of attachment errors and the spindle-assembly checkpoint ( Sacristan and Kops, 2015; Musacchio and Desai, 2017 ). It is not fully understood how kinetochores, microtubules, and associated proteins robustly assemble a bipolar spindle and align chromosomes. In particular, it is unclear which kinetochore functions are most important for error correction and proper chromosome segregation ( Lampson and Grishchuk, 2017; Sacristan and Kops, 2015 ). Error correction is affected by kinetochore geometry ( Gregan et al., 2007; Paul et al., 2009; Rumpf et al., 2010; Magidson et al., 2015; Zaytsev and Grishchuk, 2015 ) and attachment/tension sensing ( Sacristan and Kops, 2015; Musacchio, 2015; Musacchio and Desai, 2017; Salmon and Bloom, 2017 ), although the relative contribution of different effects is not established ( Nannas and Murray, 2014; Tauchman et al., 2015; Kuhn and Dumont, 2017; Yoo et al., 2018 ). Destabilization of incorrect attachments by Aurora B kinase appears to be particularly important for high-fidelity chromosome segregation ( Cheeseman et al., 2002; Cimini et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010a ). Therefore, further insight into the minimal mechanisms required for spindle assembly and chromosome biorientation could be gained from a computational model. Once the spindle assembles and attaches to chromosomes, it achieves a consistent length ( Dumont and Mitchison, 2009; Goshima and Scholey, 2010; Nannas et al., 2014; Rizk et al., 2014; Lacroix et al., 2018 ). The force-balance model proposes that outward-directed forces from plus-end directed sliding motors separate spindle poles, while inward-directed forces from minus-end directed sliding motors and chromosomes pull the poles together ( Saunders and Hoyt, 1992 ). This model helps explain perturbations that alter spindle length ( Syrovatkina et al., 2013; Hepperla et al., 2014; Chac\u00f3n et al., 2014; Nannas et al., 2014 ). However, a change in spindle length may occur from a direct change in force production or from indirect effects such as alteration in MT dynamics or alignment ( Hepperla et al., 2014; Gergely et al., 2016 ). In addition, the steady-state force-balance model requires extension to address spindle length fluctuations, in which the bipolar spindle assembles, but then undergoes large, dynamic length changes ( Bratman and Chang, 2007; Griffiths et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2009; Hsu and Toda, 2011; Masuda et al., 2013; W\u00e4lde and King, 2014; Syrovatkina et al., 2013; Gergely et al., 2016 ). Computational modeling can be a valuable tool to dissect force generation and spindle length changes. To better understand the key mechanistic requirements for chromosome biorientation and how kinetochore number and attachment affect spindle length stability, we developed a computational model of fission-yeast mitosis. Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells are amenable to genetic manipulation and quantitative experiments ( Ward et al., 2015; Mary et al., 2015; Klemm et al., 2018; Blackwell et al., 2017b; Blackwell et al., 2017a ) and the spindles are small enough that full 3D simulations are computationally tractable ( Glun\u010di\u0107 et al., 2015; Ward et al., 2015; Blackwell et al., 2017a; Lamson et al., 2019 ). We were motivated by previous work modeling spindle function and chromosome segregation ( Mogilner and Craig, 2010; Civelekoglu-Scholey and Cimini, 2014 ). Because we study de novo spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, we could not use previous models that started with an already-bipolar structure and/or chromosomes attached to the spindle. Therefore, we extended a previous model of spindle assembly in the absence of chromosomes and kinetochore-microtubule attachments ( Blackwell et al., 2017a; Rincon et al., 2017; Lamson et al., 2019 ) to include chromosomes and kinetochores. Our model successfully accomplishes spindle assembly and chromosome biorientation. The results give insight into key requirements for error correction and long-lived biorientation, emphasizing the importance of progressive restriction of attachment, destabilization of misaligned attachments, and force-dependent attachment lifetime. The turnover of kinetochore-MT attachments affects spindle mechanics, because models with larger attachment lifetime exhibit larger fluctuations in spindle length. The spindle components which contribute most to force generation change over time: initial spindle -pole separation is due to the outward force from kinesin-5 motors overcoming the passive crosslinker braking force, while interkinetochore stretch is the main inward force after biorientation. Finally, properly constructed metaphase spindles are able to robustly segregate chromosomes in the model.

This process, called mitosis, is coordinated by many different molecular machines. The DNA is copied, then the duplicated chromosomes line up at the middle of the cell. Next, an apparatus called the mitotic spindle latches onto the chromosomes before pulling them apart. The mitotic spindle is a bundle of long, thin filaments called microtubules. It attaches to chromosomes at the kinetochore, the point where two copied chromosomes are cinched together in their middle. Proper cell division is vital for the healthy growth of all organisms, big and small, and yet some parts of the process remain poorly understood despite extensive study. Specifically, there is more to learn about how the mitotic spindle self-assembles, and how microtubules and kinetochores work together to correctly orient and segregate chromosomes into two sister cells. These nanoscale processes are happening a hundred times a minute, so computer simulations are a good way to test what we know. Edelmaier et al. developed a computer model to simulate cell division in fission yeast, a species of yeast often used to study fundamental processes in the cell. The model simulates how the mitotic spindle assembles, how its microtubules attach to the kinetochore and the force required to pull two sister chromosomes apart. Building the simulation involved modelling interactions between the mitotic spindle and kinetochore, their movement and forces applied. To test its accuracy, model simulations were compared to recordings of the mitotic spindle \u2013 including its length, structure and position \u2013 imaged from dividing yeast cells. Running the simulation, Edelmaier et al. found that several key effects are essential for the proper movement of chromosomes in mitosis. This includes holding chromosomes in the correct orientation as the mitotic spindle assembles and controlling the relative position of microtubules as they attach to the kinetochore. Misaligned attachments must also be readily deconstructed and corrected to prevent any errors. The simulations also showed that kinetochores must begin to exert more force ( to separate the chromosomes ) once the mitotic spindle is attached correctly. Altogether, these findings improve the current understanding of how the mitotic spindle and its counterparts control cell division. Errors in chromosome segregation are associated with birth defects and cancer in humans, and this new simulation could potentially now be used to help make predictions about how to correct mistakes in the process ."}

Exploiting any predictability of such fluctuations can lead to an increased fitness. On longer timescales, bacteria can \u2018learn\u2019 the structure of these fluctuations through evolution. However, on shorter timescales, inferring the statistics of the environment and acting upon this information would need to be accomplished by physiological mechanisms. Here, we use a model of metabolism to show that a simple generalization of a common regulatory motif ( end-product inhibition ) is sufficient both for learning continuous-valued features of the statistical structure of the environment and for translating this information into predictive behavior; moreover, it accomplishes these tasks near-optimally. We discuss plausible genetic circuits that could instantiate the mechanism we describe, including one similar to the architecture of two-component signaling, and argue that the key ingredients required for such predictive behavior are readily accessible to bacteria.  Organisms that live in changing environments evolve strategies to respond to the fluctuations. Many such adaptations are reactive, for\u00a0example sensory systems that allow detecting changes when they occur and responding to them. However, adaptations can be not only reactive, but also predictive. For example, circadian clocks allow photosynthetic algae to reorganize their metabolism in preparation for the rising sun ( Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005; Husain et al., 2019 ). Another example is the anticipatory behavior in E. coli, which allows it to prepare for the next environment under its normal cycling through the mammalian digestive tract ( Savageau, 1983 ) ; similar behaviors have been observed in many species ( Tagkopoulos et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2009 ). All these behaviors effectively constitute predictions about a future environment: the organism improves its fitness by exploiting the regularities it \u2018learns\u2019 over the course of its evolution ( Mitchell and Lim, 2016 ). Learning such regularities can be beneficial even if they are merely statistical in nature. A prime example is bet hedging: even if the environment changes stochastically and without warning, a population that learns the statistics of switching can improve its long-term fitness, for\u00a0example, by adopting persistor phenotypes with appropriate probability ( Kussell and Leibler, 2005; Veening et al., 2008 ). The seemingly limitless ingenuity of evolutionary trial-and-error makes it plausible that virtually any statistical structure of the environment that remains constant over an evolutionary timescale could, in principle, be learnt by an evolving system, and harnessed to improve its fitness ( Watson and Szathm\u00e1ry, 2016 ). However, the statistical structure of the environment can itself change, and this change can be too quick to be learned by evolution ( Figure 1A ). For example, an organism might experience a period of stability followed by a period of large fluctuations, or an environment where two resources are correlated, and then another where they are not. Note that there are two key timescales here \u2013 that of the fluctuations themselves ( which we assume to be fast ), and the slower timescale on which the structure of those fluctuations changes. One expects such scenarios to be common in an eco-evolutionary context. As an example, consider a bacterium in a small pool of water. Its immediate environment, shaped by local interactions, is fluctuating on the timescale at which the bacterium changes neighbors. The statistical properties of these fluctuations depend on the species composition of the pool. As such, the fast fluctuations are partially predictable, and learning their structure could help inform the fitness-optimizing strategy: a neighbor encountered in a recent past is likely to be seen again in the near future. However, these statistics change on an ecological timescale, and such learning would therefore need to be accomplished by physiological, rather than evolutionary, mechanisms. On a physiological timescale, this problem is highly nontrivial: the organism would have to perform inference from prior observations, encode them in memory, and act upon this knowledge ( Figure 1B ). It is clear that solutions to this problem do exist: such behaviors, common in neural systems, can be implemented by neural-network-like architectures; and these known architectures can be translated into biochemical networks ( Hjelmfelt et al., 1991; Kobayashi, 2010; Fages et al., 2017; Katz and Springer, 2016; Katz et al., 2018 ). But single-celled organisms operate in a severely hardware-limited regime rarely probed by neuroscience. Streamlined by evolution, bacterial genomes quickly shed any unused complexity. Whether we could expect learning-like behaviors from bacteria depends on whether useful networks could be simple enough to plausibly be beneficial. Known examples of phenotypic memory, for\u00a0example, when the response is mediated by a long-lived protein, can be interpreted as a simple form of learning ( Lambert et al., 2014; Hoffer et al., 2001 ) ; circuits capable of adapting to the current mean of a fluctuating signal, as in bacterial chemotaxis ( Barkai and Leibler, 1997 ), also belong in this category. Prior theory work has also proposed that simple genetic circuits could learn more subtle binary features, such as a ( transient ) presence or absence of a correlation between two signals ( Sorek et al., 2013 ). Here, we show that a simple generalization of a ubiquitous regulatory motif, the end-product inhibition, can learn, store, and \u2018act upon\u2019 the information on continuous-valued features such as timescales and correlations of environmental fluctuations, and moreover, can do so near-optimally. We identify the key ingredients giving rise to this behavior, and argue that their applicability is likely more general than the simple metabolically\u00a0inspired example used here.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Associations inferred from previous experience can help an organism predict what might happen the next time it faces a similar situation. For example, it could anticipate the presence of certain resources based on a correlated environmental cue. The complex neural circuitry of the brain allows such associations to be learned and unlearned quickly, certainly within the lifetime of an animal. In contrast, the sub-cellular regulatory circuits of bacteria are only capable of very simple information processing. Thus, in bacteria, the \u2018learning\u2019 of environmental patterns is believed to mostly occur by evolutionary mechanisms, over many generations. Landmann et al. used computer simulations and a simple theoretical model to show that bacteria need not be limited by the slow speed of evolutionary trial and error. A basic regulatory circuit could, theoretically, allow a bacterium to learn subtle relationships between environmental factors within its lifetime. The essential components for this simulation can all be found in bacteria \u2013 including a large number of \u2018regulators\u2019, the molecules that control the rate of biochemical processes. And indeed, some organisms often have more of these biological actors than appears to be necessary. The results of Landmann et al. provide new hypothesis for how such seemingly \u2018superfluous\u2019 elements might actually be useful. Knowing that a learning process is theoretically possible, experimental biologists could now test if it appears in nature. Placing bacteria in more realistic, fluctuating conditions instead of a typical stable laboratory environment could demonstrate the role of the extra regulators in helping the microorganisms to adapt by \u2018learning\u2019 ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nUnpaired ligands are secreted signals that act via a GP130-like receptor, domeless, to activate JAK/STAT signalling in Drosophila. Like many mammalian cytokines, unpaireds can be activated by infection and other stresses and can promote insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the importance of this effect in non-inflammatory physiology is unknown. Here, we identify a requirement for unpaired-JAK signalling as a metabolic regulator in healthy adult Drosophila muscle. Adult muscles show basal JAK-STAT signalling activity in the absence of any immune challenge. Plasmatocytes ( Drosophila macrophages ) are an important source of this tonic signal. Loss of the dome receptor on adult muscles significantly reduces lifespan and causes local and systemic metabolic pathology. These pathologies result from hyperactivation of AKT and consequent deregulation of metabolism. Thus, we identify a cytokine signal that must be received in muscle to control AKT activity and metabolic homeostasis.  JAK/STAT activating signals are critical regulators of many biological processes in animals. Originally described mainly in immune contexts, it has increasingly become clear that JAK/STAT signalling is also central to metabolic regulation in many tissues ( Dodington et al., 2018; Villarino et al., 2017 ). One common consequence of activation of JAK/STAT pathways in inflammatory contexts is insulin resistance in target tissues, including muscle ( Kim et al., 2013; Mashili et al., 2013 ). However, it is difficult to describe a general metabolic interaction between JAK/STAT and insulin signalling in mammals, due to different effects at different developmental stages, differences between acute and chronic actions, and the large number of JAKs and STATs present in mammalian genomes ( Dodington et al., 2018; Mavalli et al., 2010; Nieto-Vazquez et al., 2008; Vijayakumar et al., 2013 ). The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has a single, well-conserved JAK/STAT signalling pathway. The unpaired ( upd ) genes upd1-3 encode the three known ligands for this pathway; they signal by binding to a single common GP130-like receptor, encoded by domeless ( dome ) ( Agaisse et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2002 ). Upon ligand binding, the single JAK tyrosine kinase in Drosophila, encoded by hopscotch ( hop ), is activated; Hop then activates the single known STAT, STAT92E, which functions as a homodimer ( Binari and Perrimon, 1994; Chen et al., 2002; Hou et al., 1996; Yan et al., 1996 ). This signalling pathway plays a wide variety of functions, including segmentation of the early embryo, regulation of hematopoiesis, maintenance and differentiation of stem cells in the gut, and immune modulation ( Amoyel and Bach, 2012; Myllym\u00e4ki and R\u00e4met, 2014 ). Importantly, several recent studies indicate roles for upd cytokines in metabolic regulation; for example, upds are important nutrient-responsive signals in the adult fly ( Beshel et al., 2017; Rajan and Perrimon, 2012; Woodcock et al., 2015; Zhao and Karpac, 2017 ). Here, we identify a physiological requirement for Dome signalling in adult muscle. We observe that adult muscles show significant JAK/STAT signalling activity in the absence of obvious immune challenge. Plasmatocytes are a source of this signal. Inactivation of dome on adult muscles significantly reduces lifespan and causes muscular pathology and physiological dysfunction; these result from remarkably strong AKT hyperactivation and consequent dysregulation of metabolism. We thus describe a new role for JAK/STAT signalling in adult Drosophila muscle with critical importance in healthy metabolic regulation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The immune system helps animals fend off infections, but it also has a role in controlling the body\u2019s metabolism \u2013 that is, the chemical reactions that sustain life. For instance, in fruit flies, high-fat diets can trigger the immune system, which results in cells becoming resistant to the hormone insulin and not being able to process sugar properly; this in turn leads to problems in sugar levels and shorter lifespans. This mechanism involves the release of an immune signal called unpaired-3 ( upd3 ), which then binds to a receptor known as dome. Yet, it was unclear how exactly the immune system and metabolism work together, and whether their interactions are also important in flies on a normal diet. To investigate, Kierdorf et al. stopped the activity of the dome receptor in the muscles of healthy flies. This led to an increase in the activity of the enzyme AKT, a protein critical to relay insulin-type signals inside the cell. As a result, insulin signaling was hyperactivated in the tissue, leading to decreased muscle function, unhealthy changes in how energy was stored and spent, and ultimately, a shorter life for the insects. Further experiments also identified blood cells called plasmatocytes ( the flies\u2019 equivalent of certain human immune cells ) as a key source of the upd signal. The findings by Kierdorf et al. shed a light on the fact that, even in healthy animals, complex interactions are required between the immune system and the metabolism. Further investigations will reveal if other body parts besides muscles rely on similar connections ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nHaem and iron homeostasis in most eukaryotic cells is based on a balanced flux between haem biosynthesis and haem oxygenase-mediated degradation. Unlike most eukaryotes, ticks possess an incomplete haem biosynthetic pathway and, together with other ( non-haematophagous ) mites, lack a gene encoding haem oxygenase. We demonstrated, by membrane feeding, that ticks do not acquire bioavailable iron from haemoglobin-derived haem. However, ticks require dietary haemoglobin as an exogenous source of haem since, feeding with haemoglobin-depleted serum led to aborted embryogenesis. Supplementation of serum with haemoglobin fully restored egg fertility. Surprisingly, haemoglobin could be completely substituted by serum proteins for the provision of amino-acids in vitellogenesis. Acquired haem is distributed by haemolymph carrier protein ( s ) and sequestered by vitellins in the developing oocytes. This work extends, substantially, current knowledge of haem auxotrophy in ticks and underscores the importance of haem and iron metabolism as rational targets for anti-tick interventions.  Haem, the heterocyclic tetrapyrrole that conjugates divalent iron, is an essential molecule for most aerobic organisms, as a prosthetic group of numerous enzymes involved in a variety of biological processes such as cellular respiration, detoxification of xenobiotics or redox homeostasis ( Furuyama et al., 2007; Ko\u0159en\u00fd et al., 2013 ). Most organisms synthesise their own haem by an evolutionarily conserved multi-enzymatic pathway occurring in the mitochondria and cytosol. Only a few haem auxotrophs lacking functional haem biosynthesis have been described to date. Among these rare organisms that are reliant on the acquisition of exogenous haem are, for instance, a protozoan parasitic apicomplexan Babesia bovis ( Brayton et al., 2007 ), and kinetoplastid flagellates of the genus Trypanosoma and Leishmania ( Ko\u0159en\u00fd et al., 2010 ). Some haem auxotrophs, such as the filarial nematode parasite Brugia malayi ( Ghedin et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2009 ), acquire haem from their endosymbionts, while others, such as the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( Rao et al., 2005 ) obtain haem from ingested bacteria. The inability to synthesise haem de novo was also biochemically demonstrated for the cattle tick Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) microplus ( Braz et al., 1999 ). In contrast to its benefits, haem is also cytotoxic, where free haem catalyses the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), causing cellular damage, mainly through lipid peroxidation ( Jeney et al., 2002; Klouche et al., 2004; Graca-Souza et al., 2006 ). Therefore, in all living organisms, free intracellular haem has to be maintained at a low level via strictly regulated homeostasis ( Ryter and Tyrrell, 2000; Khan and Quigley, 2011 ). This task is a critical challenge for haematophagous parasites, such as the malarial Plasmodium, blood flukes or triatominae insects that acquire large amounts of haem from digested haemoglobin ( Oliveira et al., 2000; Pagola et al., 2000; Paiva-Silva et al., 2006; Toh et al., 2010 ). Maintenance of haem balance is even more demanding for ticks, as their blood meal exceeds their own weight more than one hundred times ( Sonenshine and Roe, 2014 ). Despite its importance, the knowledge of haem acquisition, inter-tissue transport and further utilisation in ticks is fairly limited. Haemoglobin, the abundant source of haem for these animals, is processed intracellularly in tick gut digest cells by a network of cysteine and aspartic peptidases ( Sojka et al., 2013 ). Excessive haem is detoxified by aggregation in specialised organelles termed haemosomes ( Lara et al., 2003; 2005 ) and its movement from digestive vesicles is mediated by a recently described ATP-binding cassette transporter ( Lara et al., 2015 ). Only a small proportion of acquired haem is destined for systemic distribution to meet the metabolic demands of tick tissues ( Maya-Monteiro et al., 2000 ). In the present work, we have screened available tick and mite genomic databases and found that ticks have lost most genes encoding the haem biosynthetic pathway. All mites also commonly lack genes coding for haem oxygenase ( HO ) that catalyzes haem catabolism, raising the question of iron source for these organisms. Using in vitro\u00a0membrane feeding of the hard tick Ixodes ricinus ( Kr\u00f6ber and Guerin, 2007 ), the European vector of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, we performed differential feeding of females on haemoglobin-rich and haemoglobin-depleted diets. These experiments conclusively proved that ticks completely rely on the supply of exogenous haem to accomplish successful reproduction and that iron required for metabolic processes in tick tissues does not originate from haem. We propose that the unique maintenance of systemic and intracellular haem homeostasis in ticks represents a specific adaptation to their parasitic life style, and as such offers promising targets for anti-tick intervention.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Ticks are small blood-feeding parasites that transmit a range of diseases through their bites, including Lyme disease and encephalitis in humans. Like other blood-feeders, ticks acquire essential nutrients from their host in order to develop and reproduce. Iron and haem ( the iron-containing part of haemoglobin ) are essential for the metabolism of every breathing animal on Earth. Most organisms obtain iron by degrading haem and, reciprocally, most of the iron in cells is used to make haem. However, an initial search of existing genome databases revealed that ticks lack the genes required to make the proteins that make and degrade haem. Perner et al. wanted to find out if ticks can steal haem from the host and use it for their own development. To achieve this, Perner et al. exploited a method of tick membrane feeding that simulates natural feeding on a host by using a silicone imitation of a skin and cow smell extracts ( \u201cl\u00b4odeur de vache\u201d ). Ticks were fed either a haemoglobin-rich ( whole blood ) or a haemoglobin-poor ( serum ) diet. This experiment revealed that ticks can develop normally without haemoglobin, but female ticks fed a haemoglobin-poor diet lay sterile eggs out of which no offspring can hatch. Further investigation showed that haemoglobin is vitally important as a source of haem but not as a source of the amino acids needed to produce the vitellin proteins that nourish embryos. As ticks are not armed with the ability to degrade haem, they do not acquire iron from the host haem but rather from a serum transferrin, a major iron transporter protein found in mammalian blood. Further experiments revealed that ticks have evolved proteins that can transport and store haem and so make the obtained haem available across the whole tick body. Overall, Perner et al. \u2019s findings suggest that targeting the mechanisms by which ticks metabolise haem and iron could lead to the design of new \u201canti-tick\u201d strategies ."}

Today firefly luciferase is widely used in biotechnology, but the evolutionary origin of bioluminescence within beetles remains unclear. To shed light on this long-standing question, we sequenced the genomes of two firefly species that diverged over 100 million-years-ago: the North American Photinus pyralis and Japanese Aquatica lateralis. To compare bioluminescent origins, we also sequenced the genome of a related click beetle, the Caribbean Ignelater luminosus, with bioluminescent biochemistry near-identical to fireflies, but anatomically unique light organs, suggesting the intriguing hypothesis of parallel gains of bioluminescence. Our analyses support independent gains of bioluminescence in fireflies and click beetles, and provide new insights into the genes, chemical defenses, and symbionts that evolved alongside their luminous lifestyle.  Fireflies ( Coleoptera: Lampyridae ) represent the best-studied case of bioluminescence. The coded language of their luminous courtship displays ( Figure 1A; Video 1 ) has been long studied for its role in mate recognition ( Lloyd, 1966; Lewis and Cratsley, 2008; Stanger-Hall and Lloyd, 2015 ), while non-adult bioluminescence is likely a warning signal of their unpalatable chemical defenses ( De Cock and Matthysen, 1999 ), such as the cardiotoxic lucibufagins of Photinus fireflies ( Meinwald et al., 1979 ). The biochemical understanding of firefly luminescence: an ATP, Mg2+, and O2-dependent luciferase-mediated oxidation of the substrate luciferin ( Shimomura, 2012 ), along with the cloning of the luciferase gene ( de Wet et al., 1985; Ow et al., 1986 ), led to the widespread use of luciferase as a reporter with unique applications in biomedical research and industry ( Fraga, 2008 ). With >2000 species globally, fireflies are undoubtedly the most culturally appreciated bioluminescent group, yet there are at least three other beetle families with bioluminescent species: click beetles ( Elateridae ), American railroad worms ( Phengodidae ) and Asian starworms ( Rhagophthalmidae ) ( Martin et al., 2017 ). These four closely related families ( superfamily Elateroidea ) have homologous luciferases and structurally identical luciferins ( Shimomura, 2012 ), implying a single origin of beetle bioluminescence. However, as Darwin recognized in his \u2018Difficulties on Theory\u2019 ( Darwin, 1872 ), the light organs amongst the luminous beetle families are clearly distinct ( Figure 1B ), implying independent origins. Thus, whether beetle bioluminescence is derived from a single or multiple origin ( s ) remains unresolved. To address this long-standing question, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of three bioluminescent beetle species. To represent the fireflies, we sequenced the widespread North American \u2018Big Dipper Firefly\u2019, P. pyralis ( Figure 1A, C ) and the Japanese \u2018Heike-botaru\u2019 firefly Aquatica lateralis ( Figure 1B ). P. pyralis was used in classic studies of firefly bioluminescent biochemistry ( Bitler and McElroy, 1957 ) and the cloning of luciferase ( de Wet et al., 1985 ), while A. lateralis, a species with specialized aquatic larvae, is one of the few fireflies that can be reliably cultured in the laboratory ( Oba et al., 2013a ). These two fireflies represent the two major firefly subfamilies, Lampyrinae and Luciolinae, which diverged from a common ancestor over 100 Mya ( Figure 1B ) ( Misof et al., 2014; Mckenna et al., 2015 ). To facilitate evolutionary comparisons, we also sequenced the \u2018Cucubano\u2019, Ignelater luminosus ( Figure 1B ), a Caribbean bioluminescent click beetle, and member of the \u2018Pyrophorus\u2019 used by Rapha\u00ebl Dubois ( 1849-1929 ) to first establish the enzymatic basis of bioluminescence in the late 1800s ( Dubois, 1885; Dubois, 1886 ). Comparative analyses of the genomes of these three species allowed us to reconstruct the origin ( s ) and evolution of beetle bioluminescence.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Glowing fireflies dancing in the dark are one of the most enchanting sights of a warm summer night. Their light signals are \u2018love messages\u2019 that help the insects find a mate \u2013 yet, they also warn a potential predator that these beetles have powerful chemical defenses. The light comes from a specialized organ of the firefly where a small molecule, luciferin, is broken down by the enzyme luciferase. Fireflies are an ancient group, with the common ancestor of the two main lineages originating over 100 million years ago. But fireflies are not the only insects that produce light: certain click beetles are also bioluminescent. Fireflies and click beetles are closely related, and they both use identical luciferin and similar luciferases to create light. This would suggest that bioluminescence was already present in the common ancestor of the two families. However, the specialized organs in which the chemical reactions take place are entirely different, which would indicate that the ability to produce light arose independently in each group. Here, Fallon, Lower et al. try to resolve this discrepancy and to find out how many times bioluminescence evolved in beetles. This required using cutting-edge DNA sequencing to carefully piece together the genomes of two species of fireflies ( Photinus pyralis and Aquatica lateralis ) and one species of click beetle ( Ignelater luminosus ). The genetic analysis revealed that, in all species, the genes for luciferases were very similar to the genetic sequences around them, which code for proteins that break down fat. This indicates that the ancestral luciferase arose from one of these metabolic genes getting duplicated, and then one of the copies evolving a new role. However, the genes for luciferase were very different between the fireflies and the click beetles. Further analyses suggested that bioluminescence evolved at least twice: once in an ancestor of fireflies, and once in the ancestor of the bioluminescent click beetles. More results came from the reconstituted genomes. For example, Fallon, Lower et al. identified the genes \u2018turned on\u2019 in the bioluminescent organ of the fireflies. This made it possible to list genes that may be involved in creating luciferin, and enable flies to grow brightly for long periods. In addition, the genetic information yielded sequences from bacteria that likely live inside firefly cells, and which may participate in the light-making process or the production of potent chemical defenses. Better genetic knowledge of beetle bioluminescence could bring new advances for both insects and humans. It may help researchers find and design better light-emitting molecules useful to track and quantify proteins of interest in a cell. Ultimately, it would allow a detailed understanding of firefly populations around the world, which could contribute to firefly ecotourism and help to protect these glowing insects from increasing environmental threats ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nNotch signaling controls a wide range of cell fate decisions during development and disease via synergistic interactions with other signaling pathways. Here, through a genome-wide genetic screen in Drosophila, we uncover a highly complex Notch-dependent genetic circuitry that profoundly affects proliferation and consequently hyperplasia. We report a novel synergistic relationship between Notch and either of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src42A and Src64B to promote hyperplasia and tissue disorganization, which results in cell cycle perturbation, JAK/STAT signal activation, and differential regulation of Notch targets. Significantly, the JNK pathway is responsible for the majority of the phenotypes and transcriptional changes downstream of Notch-Src synergy. We previously reported that Notch-Mef2 also activates JNK, indicating that there are commonalities within the Notch-dependent proliferation circuitry; however, the current data indicate that Notch-Src accesses JNK in a significantly different fashion than Notch-Mef2.  A relatively small number of highly conserved cellular signaling pathways are responsible for a broad array of distinct, specific biological processes in metazoan development. It is clear that these pathways must interact in a combinatorial and context-dependent manner to produce the wide and diverse range of downstream events required for development, homeostasis, and disease. One of these fundamental signaling mechanisms is the Notch pathway, which is conserved amongst all metazoans and controls a wide range of cell fate decisions ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999; Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006 ). Aberrant Notch signaling levels can lead to developmental defects and various pathological conditions including cancer ( Artavanis-Tsakonas and Muskavitch, 2010; Ranganathan et al., 2011; Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2012 ). In addition to the well-documented causative role of activating Notch mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( Ellisen et al., 1991; Weng et al., 2004 ), Notch activity has been positively correlated with a number of solid cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, skin, brain, lung, colon, and pancreas ( Koch and Radtke, 2010; Ranganathan et al., 2011 ). However, Notch can also act as a tumor suppressor in other contexts ( Dotto, 2008 ). The specific mechanisms by which Notch contributes to oncogenesis remain largely opaque, although it seems clear that integration with other genes in a context-dependent fashion are key for mediating the action of Notch and its involvement in pro-oncogenic events as proliferation and metastasis. Ligand binding to the Notch cell surface receptor results in a series of cleavages that release the active C-terminus, which subsequently translocates to the nucleus and modulates the transcription of target genes ( Artavanis-Tsakonas and Muskavitch, 2010; Hori et al., 2013 ). Given that Notch is highly pleiotropic, it is clear that the developmentally crucial and highly specific downstream responses to Notch signal activation depend on its cellular context and the integration of the signal with other signaling pathways ( Hurlbut et al., 2007; Bray and Bernard, 2010 ). Indeed, a number of genetic screens in our lab and others have revealed a staggering number of genes that interact with Notch to modulate downstream phenotypes; given that the results from these studies, which encompass various biological processes, have surprisingly little overlap, it seems likely that the full gamut of genes that can genetically interact with and influence Notch has not yet been identified ( Kankel et al., 2007; Hurlbut et al., 2009; Shalaby et al., 2009; Saj et al., 2010; Guruharsha et al., 2012 ). We previously reported a synergistic interaction between activated Notch and the transcription factor Mef2, and showed that it activates the JNK signaling pathway ( Pallavi et al., 2012 ). In addition to its classical role as a cell stress mediator, JNK, like Notch, plays roles in multiple morphogenetic processes including proliferation, cell death, and cell shape changes ( Rios-Barrera and Riesgo-Escovar, 2013 ). In this work, we report the results of a systematic, genome-wide modifier screen in Drosophila to dissect and define the genetic circuitry that interacts with Notch to affect proliferation events. We investigate the mechanism of a novel synergistic interaction via JNK between Notch and the Drosophila Src genes, which regulate proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and motility and whose human orthologs are abnormally activated in numerous types of primary and metastatic tumors ( Stewart et al., 2003; Pedraza et al., 2004; Vidal et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2009; Wheeler et al., 2009; Guarino, 2010 ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The cells within animals are organized into tissues and organs that perform particular roles. To develop and maintain these structures, the ability of individual cells to divide and grow is strictly controlled by the activities of many proteins, including one called Notch. This protein is found in all multicellular organisms and allows cells to communicate with each other. Mutations in the gene that encodes Notch can cause cells to divide excessively and lead to cancer and other diseases. Notch regulates the growth and division of cells by interacting with many other proteins. For example, Mef2 works with Notch to activate a communication system called the JNK pathway. This pathway is involved in controlling cell division, cell death, and cell movement. However, it is thought that Notch may also interact with other proteins that have not yet been identified. Now, Ho et al. have conducted a genome-wide screen in fruit flies to find proteins that interact with Notch. The experiments used flies that develop abnormally large eyes because they have an over-active Notch protein. Ho et al. identified hundreds of fruit fly genes that could increase or decrease the size of the flies' eyes in the presence of Notch activity. Many of these genes are known to be involved in development, cell division, or in controlling the activity of other genes. Ho et al. found that two of these genes encode similar proteins called Src42A and Src64B, which are similar to the Src proteins that are involved in many types of human cancers. The experiments show that both proteins interact with Notch to promote uncontrolled cell division and lead to tissues in the flies becoming more disorganized. The JNK pathway is also activated by Notch working with Src42A or Src64B, but in a different manner to how it is activated by Mef2 and Notch, and with different consequences for cells. This study provides new insights into how genes work together in order to influence cell division and other events in development. Also, it suggests that Notch activity may regulate the growth of cancers linked with defects in the Src proteins ."}

Instead, we show that individuals implement decision bias by shifting the rate of sensory evidence accumulation toward a decision bound. Participants performed a target detection task while we recorded EEG. We experimentally manipulated participants\u2019 decision criterion for reporting targets using different stimulus-response reward contingencies, inducing either a liberal or a conservative bias. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that a liberal strategy biased sensory evidence accumulation toward target-present choices. Moreover, a liberal bias resulted in stronger midfrontal pre-stimulus 2\u20146 Hz ( theta ) power and suppression of pre-stimulus 8\u201412 Hz ( alpha ) power in posterior cortex. Alpha suppression in turn was linked to the output activity in visual cortex, as expressed through 59\u2014100 Hz ( gamma ) power. These findings show that observers can intentionally control cortical excitability to strategically bias evidence accumulation toward the decision bound that maximizes reward.  Perceptual decisions arise not only from the evaluation of sensory evidence, but are often biased toward a\u00a0given choice alternative by environmental factors, perhaps as a result of task instructions and/or stimulus-response reward contingencies ( White and Poldrack, 2014 ). The ability to willfully control decision bias could potentially enable the behavioral flexibility required to survive in an ever-changing and uncertain environment. But despite its important role in decision making, the neural mechanisms underlying decision bias are not fully understood. The traditional account of decision bias comes from signal detection theory ( SDT ) ( Green and Swets, 1966 ). In SDT, decision bias is quantified by estimating the relative position of a decision point ( or \u2018criterion\u2019 ) in between sensory evidence distributions for noise and signal ( see Figure 1A ). In this framework, a more liberal decision bias arises by moving the criterion closer toward the noise distribution ( see green arrow in Figure 1A ). Although SDT has been very successful at quantifying decision bias, how exactly bias affects decision making and how it is reflected in neural activity remains unknown. One reason for this lack of insight may be that SDT does not have a temporal component to track how decisions are reached over time ( Fetsch et al., 2014 ). As an alternative to SDT, the\u00a0drift diffusion model ( DDM ) conceptualizes perceptual decision making as the accumulation of noisy sensory evidence over time into an internal decision variable ( Bogacz et al., 2006;\u00a0Gold and Shadlen, 2007;\u00a0Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008 ). A decision in this model is made when the decision variable crosses one of two decision bounds corresponding to the choice alternatives. After one of the bounds is reached, the corresponding decision can subsequently either be actively reported, e. g. by means of a button press indicating a detected signal, or it could remain without behavioral report when no signal is detected ( Ratcliff et al., 2018 ). Within this framework, a strategic decision bias imposed by the environment can be modelled in two different ways: either by moving the starting point of evidence accumulation closer to one of the boundaries ( see green arrow in\u00a0Figure 1B ), or by biasing the rate of the evidence accumulation process itself toward one of the boundaries ( see green arrow in\u00a0Figure 1C ). In both the SDT and DDM frameworks, decision bias shifts have little effect on the sensitivity of the observer when distinguishing signal from noise; they predominantly affect the relative response ratios ( and in the case of DDM, the speed with which one or the other decision bound is reached ). There has been some evidence to suggest that decision bias induced by shifting the criterion is best characterized by a drift bias in the DDM ( Urai et al., 2018;\u00a0White and Poldrack, 2014 ). However, the drift bias parameter has as yet not been related to a well-described neural mechanism. Regarding the neural underpinnings of decision bias, there have been a number of reports about a correlational relationship between cortical population activity measured with EEG and decision bias. For example, spontaneous trial-to-trial variations in pre-stimulus oscillatory activity in the 8\u201412 Hz ( alpha ) band have been shown to correlate with decision bias and confidence ( Iemi and Busch, 2018; Limbach and Corballis, 2016 ). Alpha oscillations, in turn, have been proposed to be involved in the gating of task-relevant sensory information ( Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010 ), possibly encoded in high-frequency ( gamma ) oscillations in visual cortex ( Ni et al., 2016; Popov et al., 2017 ). Although these reports suggest links between pre-stimulus alpha suppression, sensory information gating, and decision bias, they do not uncover whether pre-stimulus alpha plays an instrumental role in decision bias and how exactly this might be achieved. Specifically, it is unknown whether an experimentally induced shift in decision bias is implemented in the brain by willfully adjusting pre-stimulus alpha in sensory areas. Here, we explicitly investigate these potential mechanisms by employing a task paradigm in which shifts in decision bias were experimentally induced within participants through ( a ) instruction and ( b ) asymmetries in stimulus-response reward contingencies during a visual target detection task. By applying drift diffusion modeling to the participants\u2019 choice behavior, we show that the effect of strategically adjusting decision bias is best captured by the drift bias parameter, which is thought to reflect a bias in the rate of sensory evidence accumulation toward one of the two decision bounds. To substantiate a neural mechanism for this effect, we demonstrate that this bias shift is accompanied by changes in pre-stimulus midfrontal 2\u20136 Hz ( theta ) power, as well as changes in sensory alpha suppression. Pre-stimulus alpha suppression in turn is\u00a0linked\u00a0to the post-stimulus output\u00a0of visual cortex, as reflected in gamma power modulation. Critically, we show that gamma activity accurately predicted the strength of evidence accumulation bias within participants, providing a direct link between the proposed mechanism and decision bias. Together, these findings identify a\u00a0neural mechanism by which intentional control of cortical excitability is applied to strategically bias perceptual decisions in order to maximize reward in a given ecological context.

During an economic boom, you might happily commit to buying a new vehicle that goes on sale, but prefer to sit on your savings during a financial crisis, despite how good the offer may be. Adjusting how you make decisions in situations like this can help you optimize choices in an ever-changing world. It\u2019s currently thought that when deciding, we accumulate evidence for each of the available options. When evidence for one of the options passes a threshold, we choose that option. External factors \u2013 such as a booming economy when considering buying a car \u2013 could bias this process in two different ways. The standard view is that they move the starting point of evidence accumulation towards one of the two choices, so that the threshold for choosing that option is more easily reached. Alternatively, they could bias the accumulation process itself, so that evidence builds up more quickly towards one of the choices. To distinguish between these possibilities, Kloosterman et al. asked volunteers to press a button whenever they detected a target hidden among a stream of visual patterns. To bias their decisions, volunteers were penalized differently in two experimental conditions: either when they failed to report a target ( a \u2018miss\u2019 ), or when they \u2018detected\u2019 a target when in fact nothing was there ( a \u2018false alarm\u2019 ). As expected, punishing participants for missing a target made them more liberal towards reporting targets, whereas penalizing false alarms made them more conservative. Computational modeling of behavior revealed that when participants used a liberal strategy, they did not move closer to the threshold for deciding target presence. Instead, they accumulated evidence for target presence at a faster rate, even when in fact no target was shown. Brain activity recorded during this task reveals how this bias in evidence accumulation might come about. When a volunteer adopted a liberal response strategy, visual brain areas showed a reduction in low-frequency \u2018alpha\u2019 waves, suggesting increased attention. This in turn triggered an increase in high-frequency \u2018gamma\u2019 waves, reflecting biased evidence accumulation for target presence ( irrespective of whether a target actually appeared or not ). Overall, the findings reported by Kloosterman et al. suggest that we can strategically bias perceptual decision-making by varying how quickly we accumulate evidence in favor of different response options. This might explain how we are able to adapt our decisions to environments that differ in payoffs and punishments. The next challenge is to understand whether such biases also affect high-level decisions, for example, when purchasing a new car ."}

PM association of the main structural protein Gag depends on its myristoylated MA domain and PM PI ( 4, 5 ) P2. Using a novel chemical biology tool that allows rapidly tunable manipulation of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 levels in living cells, we show that depletion of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 completely prevents Gag PM targeting and assembly site formation. Unexpectedly, PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 depletion also caused loss of pre-assembled Gag lattices from the PM. Subsequent restoration of PM PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 reinduced assembly site formation even in the absence of new protein synthesis, indicating that the dissociated Gag molecules remained assembly competent. These results reveal an important role of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 for HIV-1 morphogenesis beyond Gag recruitment to the PM and suggest a dynamic equilibrium of Gag-lipid interactions. Furthermore, they establish an experimental system that permits synchronized induction of HIV-1 assembly leading to induced production of infectious virions by targeted modulation of Gag PM targeting.  Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) particles assemble and bud at the plasma membrane ( PM ) of infected cells. This requires trafficking of the main structural component Gag from its site of synthesis at cytosolic polysomes to the inner leaflet of the PM. Here, Gag assembles into a multimeric lattice comprising\u00a0~2500 Gag molecules. Gag also recruits the other constituents of the infectious virion as well as components of the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) to nascent budding sites ( reviewed in Sundquist and Kr\u00e4usslich, 2012 ). Gag consists of the individually folded MA ( matrix ), CA ( capsid ), NC ( nucleocapsid ) and p6 domains, which separate upon proteolytic maturation to the infectious virion. CA and NC mediate protein and RNA interactions during virion morphogenesis, while p6 recruits ESCRT components. PM targeting of Gag depends on the N-terminal MA domain. Mutational analyses revealed that the N-terminal myristoyl moiety and a surface exposed patch of basic residues in MA ( the highly basic region, HBR ) are important for Gag targeting, membrane association and virus formation ( Lorizate and Kr\u00e4usslich, 2011; Freed, 2015 ). However, these two features would not be sufficient to explain specific PM targeting. The phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ) is known to act as a cue for specific recruitment of many peripheral PM proteins and was also shown to be important for Gag PM targeting. Depleting PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 abolished PM targeting of Gag, while increasing PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 at intracellular membranes redirected Gag to those sites ( Ono et al., 2004 ). Consistently, several studies reported that presence of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 enhances binding of Gag-derived proteins to synthetic liposomes in vitro ( Chukkapalli et al., 2008, 2010; Dick et al., 2012; Olety and Ono, 2014; Mercredi et al., 2016 ), and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 appeared to be enriched in the HIV-1 lipidome ( Chan et al., 2008 ). Gag seems to dominate in a monomeric form or in small oligomers in the cytoplasm ( Kutluay and Bieniasz, 2010; Hendrix et al., 2015 ), and its N-terminal myristate group is proposed to be buried within the globular domain of MA at this stage ( Spearman et al., 1997; Saad et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2004 ). Gag interaction with PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 has been suggested to trigger exposure of the myristate moiety followed by its insertion into the inner leaflet of the PM, thereby anchoring Gag. Recent models propose a regulatory role of RNA for this myristoyl switch ( Chukkapalli et al., 2010; Alfadhli et al., 2011; Chukkapalli et al., 2013; Kutluay et al., 2014 ). In the cytosol, specific cellular tRNAs are bound to the basic region of MA in the absence of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2, thus preventing premature Gag association with intracellular membranes. This MA-tRNA interaction may be outcompeted by PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 at the PM, thereby triggering the myristoyl switch. The NMR structure of HIV-1 MA bound to a PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 molecule carrying truncated acyl chains revealed the 2\u00b4 acyl chain to be buried in the myristoyl-binding pocket of MA ( Saad et al., 2006 ). This observation suggested a model for Gag membrane anchoring, which was subsequently challenged by a recent report from the same group, however ( Mercredi et al., 2016 ). Upon arrival of Gag at the PM, the 2\u00b4 acyl chain of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 may be flipped outward and displace myristate from the acyl binding pocket of MA. Myristate in turn would insert into the PM. The consequent exchange of the unsaturated 2\u00b4 acyl chain of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 by the saturated myristic acid would increase local lipid saturation and membrane order. If occurring in all or a majority of the\u00a0~2500 tightly packed Gag molecules, this mechanism could also explain the observed liquid-ordered state of the HIV envelope ( Lorizate et al., 2009; Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2008 ). This model would further suggest that Gag clusters are stably anchored to the PM via their myristoyl moiety and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 would then be expected to be dispensable once anchoring has occurred. PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 is clearly important for Gag PM targeting, but the dynamics of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 Gag interaction and the role of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 in later stages of HIV assembly have not been examined so far. To do this, we need to monitor Gag localization in real time while manipulating PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 levels in living cells. Here, we made use of a recently developed reversible chemical dimerizer system ( abbreviated rCDS ) allowing rapid and controlled depletion and reconstitution of PM PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 levels in living, virus-producing cells by a small molecule ( Feng et al., 2014; Schifferer et al., 2015 ). Using this system, we showed that the nascent HIV-1 Gag assembly site is highly dependent on PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 during the entire assembly process, and membrane association of apparently complete assembly sites remained PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 dependent. PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 removal from the PM not only abolished Gag PM targeting, but also caused dissociation of pre-assembled Gag clusters from the membrane. Reconstitution of bona fide Gag assembly sites at the PM was observed upon re-establishment of PM PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 levels. Our findings are inconsistent with stable anchoring of large Gag clusters at the PM through myristoyl moieties alone and suggest a highly dynamic mode of Gag PM binding. Furthermore, this approach allows synchronization of assembly and release of infectious HIV-1. These processes are usually highly asynchronous, both within a cell population and on the level of individual cells ( Ivanchenko et al., 2009 ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Viruses are parasites that must infect the living cell of a host in order to grow and replicate. To do so, the virus attaches to the host\u2019s cell and transfers its genetic material to the inside. The virus then hijacks the cell and forces it to build proteins and more genetic material that will assemble into new copies of the virus, and the completed virus particles are released to infect new cells. The HIV-1 virus encodes a protein called Gag that coordinates the assembly of new copies of this virus. Thousands of Gag proteins accumulate into a lattice at the inside of the host cell membrane by an unknown mechanism, where they gather all essential components to form a new infectious virus. Once completed, the virus particle detaches itself from the host cell and Gag gives the virus its structure. Previous research by several groups has shown that a lipid molecule found in cell membranes called PIP2 can bind to Gag and helps the virus to assemble. However, until now, it was unclear if PIP2 anchors Gag to the cell membrane of living cells and if it plays any other roles in the later stages of assembly. Now, M\u00fccksch et al. have developed a new approach to study this question by rapidly manipulating the levels of PIP2 in living cells and monitoring Gag assembly through a fluorescent marker. The experiments showed that PIP2 was needed to initiate the assembly process, but also to maintain the partially assembled Gag lattice at the membrane. When PIP2 was removed, Gag proteins could not gather at the cell membrane and the already assembled Gag lattices broke down. When PIP2 levels were increased again, the Gag proteins that had disappeared from the membrane formed new lattices. This suggests that PIP2 has a much broader role in HIV-1 particle formation than previously assumed. A next step will be to use this new experimental approach to study how particles of HIV are assembled and released. This knowledge may help scientists to develop antiviral drugs that interfere with the assembly step of the virus that could be used to prevent or treat HIV infections ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nZona pellucida ( ZP ), the extracellular matrix sheltering mammalian oocytes and embryos, is composed by 3 to 4 proteins. The roles of the three proteins present in mice have been elucidated by KO models, but the function of the fourth component ( ZP4 ), present in all other eutherian mammals studied so far, has remained elusive. Herein, we report that ZP4 ablation impairs fertility in female rabbits. Ovulation, fertilization and in vitro development to blastocyst were not affected by ZP4 ablation. However, in vivo development is severely impaired in embryos covered by a ZP4-devoided zona, suggesting a defective ZP protective capacity in the absence of ZP4. ZP4-null ZP was significantly thinner, more permeable, and exhibited a more disorganized and fenestrated structure. The evolutionary conservation of ZP4 in other mammals, including humans, suggests that the structural properties conferred by this protein are required to ensure proper embryo sheltering during in vivo preimplantation development.  Mammalian oocytes and early preimplantation embryos are surrounded by a glycoprotein shell termed zona pellucida ( ZP ) that serves important functions during folliculogenesis, species-specific fertilization and early development. In eutherian mammals, this glycoprotein shell is solely composed of 3 to 4 proteins depending on the species. The differences in ZP composition between eutherian mammals is the consequence of duplication and/or pseudogenization events during evolution. In all eutherian mammals studied so far ZP always contain ZP2 and ZP3 proteins, but ZP1 or ZP4 may be absent, as both are paralogous genes formed by duplication of a common ancestry gene ( reviewed by Goudet et al., 2008 ). The functions of the three proteins ( ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3 ) present in mouse ZP have been elucidated by gene ablation experiments. ZP1 serves a structural function, being dispensable for sperm binding or fertilization ( Rankin et al., 1999 ). ZP1 null females display perturbed folliculogenesis and, although ovulation rates are not affected, both cleavage rate and litter size are reduced, likely due to ZP1-null zona being unable to protect the developing embryo. ZP2 ablation also results in structural defects, which are more severe, as the number of antral follicles is reduced and only few ZP-free oocytes and no two-cell embryos are recovered from Zp2 knock-out ( KO ) females after mating ( Rankin et al., 2001 ). Finally, Zp3 KO mice are unable to form ZP, showing a drastic reduction in ovulation rates and also being unable to produce cleaved embryos after mating ( Liu et al., 1996;\u00a0Rankin et al., 1996 ). Given the lack of ZP on ovulated Zp2- or Zp3-null oocytes, these KO models could not assess the role of these proteins on sperm binding. To study that process, more complex gain-of-function transgenic mouse models have been generated. In particular, the generation of ZP composed of different combinations of human ZP proteins ( Baibakov et al., 2012 ) or an heterologous ZP lacking mouse ZP2 protein ( Avella et al., 2014 ) have uncovered a crucial role of ZP2 on mouse and human sperm recognition. The fourth ZP protein component, ZP4, is absent in mice, which seems to be an exception for mammals, as ZP4 is present in multiple mammalian species including humans ( Hughes and Barratt, 1999; Lefi\u00e8vre et al., 2004 ), rabbits ( Stetson et al., 2012 ), ungulates ( Hedrick and Wardrip, 1987; Noguchi et al., 1994; Topper et al., 1997 ), carnivores ( Moros-Nicol\u00e1s et al., 2018 ) and other rodents ( Hoodbhoy et al., 2005; Izquierdo-Rico et al., 2009 ). The lack of ZP4 in laboratory mouse ( Mus musculus ), the only species where KO models were readily available, has precluded the study of the role of this protein by of loss-of-function experiments. Gene ablation experiments are essential to unequivocally know the function of a gene, but were largely restricted to mice, given the technical difficulties to perform site-specific genome modification in other mammalian species ( Lamas-Toranzo et al., 2017 ). Luckily, the advent of site-specific endonucleases, and particularly CRISPR, the last technology to be developed and the easiest to tailor to its genomic target, allows direct KO generation in one step. Using this technology, we have generated ZP4-null rabbits uncovering that ZP4 confers structural properties to the ZP that are essential to protect the developing preimplantation embryo.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The egg cells of mammals, called oocytes, are encased in a protective layer called the zona pellucida. This layer is made from proteins called ZP1 to 4. Most studies of the zona pellucida use mice, which do not have ZP4. This means that the research community have limited knowledge of what ZP4 does in humans and other mammals. Scientists can now use a technique called CRISPR to selectively modify the genetics of living things to help us to understand what specific genes and proteins do. The ZP4 protein can be eliminated from rabbit oocytes using CRISPR to help understand its role in egg cell fertilization and development. Lamas-Toranzo et al. examined the effect of losing ZP4 from rabbit oocytes. Without ZP4 the zona pellucida becomes thinner, irregular and more flexible. However, the loss of ZP4 did not affect ovulation ( i. e. the release of egg cells from an ovary ), fertilization, or the early stages of development of embryos when studied in the laboratory. However, rabbits without ZP4 were much less fertile. Indeed, only one out of 10 female rabbits without ZP4 was able to deliver pups because in most cases the development of embryos in the womb failed. These findings show that ZP4 has a structural role in the zona pellucida. Without ZP4 fertility is reduced. This work lays the ground for further investigation of the role of ZP4. It could also offer new insights into the causes of infertility ."}

We find that multiple alphaviruses, including chikungunya ( CHIKV ), Ross River ( RRV ), and o\u2019nyong \u2018nyong ( ONNV ) viruses, are cleared from the circulation of mice by liver Kupffer cells, impeding viral dissemination. Clearance from the circulation was independent of natural antibodies or complement factor C3, and instead relied on scavenger receptor SR-A6 ( MARCO ). Remarkably, lysine to arginine substitutions at distinct residues within the E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV and ONNV ( E2 K200R ) as well as RRV ( E2 K251R ) allowed for escape from clearance and enhanced viremia and dissemination. Mutational analysis revealed that viral clearance from the circulation is strictly dependent on the presence of lysine at these positions. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized innate immune pathway that controls alphavirus viremia and dissemination in vertebrate hosts, ultimately influencing disease severity and likely transmission efficiency.  During the past several decades, multiple arboviruses, including dengue ( DENV ), chikungunya ( CHIKV ), and Zika ( ZIKV ) viruses, have re-emerged to cause widespread epidemics affecting millions of people ( Weaver, 2018 ). For example, DENVs are estimated to cause\u00a0~390 million infections per year resulting in\u00a0~500, 000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome that can result in death ( Bhatt et al., 2013 ). Since 2004, CHIKV has infected millions of people and expanded into Europe, Asia, the Pacific region, and the Americas ( Moro et al., 2010; Volk et al., 2010; Zeller et al., 2016 ). Joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, and tenosynovitis, can endure for months to years after CHIKV infection ( Borgherini et al., 2008; Couturier et al., 2012; G\u00e9rardin et al., 2011; Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2016; Schilte et al., 2013 ). As chronic CHIKV disease is debilitating, large epidemics have severe economic impact ( Cardona-Ospina et al., 2015; Soumahoro et al., 2011; Vijayakumar et al., 2013 ). ZIKV caused outbreaks on Yap Island ( Duffy et al., 2009 ) and islands of French Polynesia ( Musso et al., 2018 ) in 2007 and 2013, respectively, before being introduced to the Americas ( Metsky et al., 2017 ). Here, ZIKV caused nearly one million confirmed and suspected cases and became recognized as a cause of congenital neurodevelopmental defects ( Pierson and Diamond, 2018 ). The lack of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics limits prevention and treatment of many arboviral diseases. The magnitude and duration of viremia in vertebrate hosts are important determinants of arboviral emergence, transmission efficiency, and geographic spread ( Weaver, 2018 ). A subset of arboviruses, including CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV, are capable of sustained human-mosquito-human transmission cycles, allowing for rapid spread through urban environments. This is in part due to the capacity of these viruses to generate a magnitude and duration of viremia in humans sufficient to infect mosquito vectors and propagate the transmission cycle ( Weaver, 2018 ). Moreover, for many arboviruses, viremia levels correlate with disease severity ( Chow et al., 2011; de St Maurice et al., 2018; Pozo-Aguilar et al., 2014; Vaughn et al., 2000; Waggoner et al., 2016 ). Despite the critical role for viremia during arboviral infections, innate host defenses that determine the magnitude and duration of arboviral viremia in vertebrate hosts are poorly defined. Phagocytic cells are strategically positioned within organs such as the spleen and liver to detect and capture circulating self and non-self molecules. In the murine spleen, blood released from terminal arterioles drains into the marginal zone, which separates the white and red pulp ( Lewis et al., 2019 ). Within the marginal zone, tissue resident marginal zone ( MZM ) and metallophilic ( MMM ) macrophages surveil the blood for circulating antigens, apoptotic cells, debris, and pathogens ( Borges da Silva et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2019 ). In addition, splenic red pulp macrophages ( RPM ) also function to surveil the circulation by removing aberrant red blood cells as well as some pathogens, such as malaria parasites ( Borges da Silva et al., 2015 ). Similar to the marginal zone of the spleen, cell populations in liver sinusoids, including tissue resident macrophages ( i. e., Kupffer cells ( KCs ) ), effectively survey blood as it percolates through the liver ( Hickey and Kubes, 2009 ). For example, following intravenous inoculation, bacteria are captured within seconds by KCs ( Lee et al., 2010; Zeng et al., 2016 ), whereas the absence of KCs results in persistent bacteremia ( Lee et al., 2010 ). Although the surveillance function of these tissues and cells is well-established, how they influence viremia following arbovirus infections has not been defined. In this study, we demonstrate that phagocytic cells are essential for efficient clearance of multiple alphaviruses from the circulation, thus limiting viremia and impeding viral dissemination. Experiments in splenectomized mice showed that the spleen is dispensable for clearance of these circulating alphaviruses. Consistent with this, we found that virus accumulates in the liver, and liver resident KCs play a dominant role in removing circulating alphavirus particles. Mechanistically, we identified SR-A6 ( MARCO ) as the receptor required for efficient alphavirus clearance. We also found that discrete lysine ( K ) to arginine ( R ) mutations in the E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV and o\u2019nyong \u2018nyong\u00a0virus ( ONNV ) ( E2 K200R ), as well as Ross River virus ( RRV ) ( E2 K251R ), abrogated clearance of circulating alphavirus particles, and promoted rapid viral dissemination. Moreover, substitution of the lysine residues at CHIKV E2 200 or RRV E2 251 with a variety of other amino acids also allowed for clearance evasion, indicating an essential requirement for key lysine residues in E2 for efficient viral clearance from the circulation. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized innate immune pathway that controls alphavirus viremia and dissemination in vertebrate hosts.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Viruses transmitted by blood-feeding insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks, cause serious human diseases. In recent years these viruses ( also known as arboviruses ) have re-emerged at an unprecedented scale, leading to global outbreaks of diseases such as Zika or chikungunya fever. The severity of these diseases and how easily they can be transmitted depends, in part, on the level of virus in the host\u2019s bloodstream following infection. The more viral particles present in the blood, the easier it is for other insects that bite the host to become infected and help spread the disease. Yet, the mechanisms that hosts use to control the amount of virus present in the blood and how long it persists are poorly understood. To investigate this further, Carpentier et al. used a combination of molecular and genetic techniques to study how mice clear particles of arbovirus from their bloodstream. Surgically removing the spleen from infected mice revealed that this organ, which filters out unwanted or damaged materials from blood, is not required to clear some arbovirus particles. Carpentier et al. found that removing these arboviruses from the blood instead required Kupffer cells, a type of immune cell found in the liver. Genetically manipulating mice so they no longer produced a protein on the surface of Kupffer cells known as MARCO revealed that this receptor is needed to clear chikungunya viral particles. When MARCO was genetically deleted this led to an increase in the number of viral particles in the mice\u2019s bloodstream, and allowed the virus to spread more rapidly throughout the bodies of the mice. Further experiments on three different types of arboviruses showed that in order to be cleared by MARCO, each of these viruses needed a lysine residue \u2013 one of the building blocks that makes up proteins \u2013 at defined positions within their protein sequence. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism for how hosts remove arbovirus particles from their bloodstream. Future studies could use this information to identify new ways to control the transmission and reduce the severity of these viral diseases ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nCollaboration among the multitude of RNA-binding proteins ( RBPs ) is ubiquitous, yet our understanding of these key regulatory complexes has been limited to single RBPs. We investigated combinatorial translational regulation by Drosophila Pumilio ( Pum ) and Nanos ( Nos ), which control development, fertility, and neuronal functions. Our results show how the specificity of one RBP ( Pum ) is modulated by cooperative RNA recognition with a second RBP ( Nos ) to synergistically repress mRNAs. Crystal structures of Nos-Pum-RNA complexes reveal that Nos embraces Pum and RNA, contributes sequence-specific contacts, and increases Pum RNA-binding affinity. Nos shifts the recognition sequence and promotes repression complex formation on mRNAs that are not stably bound by Pum alone, explaining the preponderance of sub-optimal Pum sites regulated in vivo. Our results illuminate the molecular mechanism of a regulatory switch controlling crucial gene expression programs, and provide a framework for understanding how the partnering of RBPs evokes changes in binding specificity that underlie regulatory network dynamics.  Post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms are widespread and mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins ( RBPs ) that interact dynamically with target mRNAs ( Baltz et al., 2012; Castello et al., 2012; Gerstberger et al., 2014 ). Understanding how RBPs function together to control the location, timing and level of protein expression is paramount. Decades of research have established the crucial roles of two archetypal RBPs, Drosophila melanogaster Nanos ( Nos ) and Pumilio ( Pum ), in developmental patterning, fertility, and nervous system development and function. We use this system to explore how two RBPs cooperatively define regulatory networks. Pum is a founding member of the Pum/fem-3 mRNA-binding factor ( FBF ), or PUF family, of eukaryotic RBPs ( Wickens et al., 2002 ). PUF proteins share a sequence-specific RNA-binding domain known as the Pum Homology Domain ( PUM-HD ) ( Barker et al., 1992; Macdonald, 1992; Wharton et al., 1998; Zamore et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1997 ). Crystal structures of PUF proteins have illuminated their unique RNA recognition properties ( Edwards et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2008; Qiu et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2001, 2002, 2009; Wilinski et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2009 ). Pum binds with high affinity to specific sequences in target mRNAs and represses protein expression and enhances mRNA degradation ( Gerber et al., 2006; Weidmann et al., 2012, 2014; Wharton et al., 1998; Wreden et al., 1997; Zamore et al., 1999, 1997 ). A classic example of Pum activity is the establishment of embryonic body pattern through repression of maternal hunchback ( hb ) mRNA, which requires collaboration with Nos ( Lehmann and Nusslein-Volhard, 1987, 1991; Murata and Wharton, 1995; Sonoda and Wharton, 1999; Wang and Lehmann, 1991 ). Regulation of hb mRNA by Pum relies on the spatial distribution of Nos, a tandem CCHC Zn finger ( ZF ) RBP ( Barker et al., 1992; Curtis et al., 1997; Forbes and Lehmann, 1998 ). Maternal hb mRNA and Pum protein are distributed throughout the syncytial Drosophila embryo ( Macdonald, 1992; Tautz, 1988 ), whereas Nos protein forms a gradient emanating from the posterior end ( Wang and Lehmann, 1991 ). Where their expression overlaps, Pum and Nos together repress hb mRNA ( Barker et al., 1992; Lehmann and Nusslein-Volhard, 1991; Murata and Wharton, 1995; Sonoda and Wharton, 1999 ). In the absence of Nos or Pum expression, Hb protein is produced throughout the embryo, and no abdominal segments are formed. Regulation of hb mRNA by Pum and Nos is dependent on two Nanos Response Elements ( NREs ) in the 3\u00b4UTR ( Murata and Wharton, 1995; Wharton and Struhl, 1991 ). Each NRE contains a binding site for Pum with the RNA consensus sequence, 5\u00b4-UGUAHAUA ( where H is A, U or C ), the Pumilio Response Element ( PRE ). Additional nucleotides in the NRE, located 5\u00b4 of the PRE, are functionally important for hb regulation and were proposed to be recognized by Nos ( Edwards et al., 2001; Sonoda and Wharton, 1999 ). By itself, Nos appeared to lack RNA sequence specificity ( Curtis et al., 1997 ). Instead, Nos binding to hb NREs requires Pum RNA recognition ( Sonoda and Wharton, 1999 ). Hence, combinatorial hb mRNA repression requires the sequence specificity of Pum and the spatial information provided by the Nos gradient. Nos and Pum also regulate germline and neurological processes ( Forbes and Lehmann, 1998; Mee et al., 2004; Menon et al., 2009, 2004; Ye et al., 2004 ). Nos and Pum collaborate to repress expression of Cyclin B mRNA ( CycB ) in primordial germ cells and germline stem cells ( Asaoka-Taguchi et al., 1999 ) and the sodium channel paralytic ( para ) in the nervous system ( Muraro et al., 2008 ). Like hb mRNA, CycB and para mRNAs possess NREs with PRE-like motifs. Furthermore, genome-wide analyses have identified hundreds of Pum-associated mRNAs, suggesting that Pum may play an expansive regulatory role beyond the few validated target RNAs ( Gerber et al., 2006; Laver et al., 2015 ). While collaboration between Nos and Pum is firmly established, the mechanism by which they do so remains to be determined. Here, we report the crystal structures of Nos-Pum-RNA complexes, which reveal that Nos acts as a molecular clamp that embraces both Pum and RNA. The C-terminal region of Pum undergoes conformational changes to make new contacts with the RNA and Nos. We explored the hypothesis that Nos promotes repression by modulating the RNA-binding activity of Pum. We show that Nos enhances the cellular repression activity and in vitro RNA-binding affinity of Pum. Moreover, Nos contacts nucleotides upstream of the PRE. In doing so, Nos alters the specificity of the repression complex and promotes repression of RNAs that are not stably bound by Pum alone. We performed RNA target selection and high-throughput sequencing, which, together with RNA-binding and cellular repression assays, demonstrate that Nos diversifies Pum RNA regulatory networks.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Molecules of DNA contain the instructions needed to make proteins inside cells. Proteins perform many different roles and each needs to be produced at the right time and in the right amounts to enable the cells to survive. The DNA is first copied to make molecules of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ), which are then used as templates to make the proteins. One way to control protein production is to regulate the RNA molecules. A family of proteins called RNA-binding proteins can recognise and bind to specific RNA molecules and determine whether a RNA molecule is destroyed, used to produce proteins, or stored for later use. In effect, these RNA-binding proteins act as switches that turn protein production on or off. Nanos and Pumilio are two RNA-binding proteins that are found in many organisms, including humans and other animals. Genetic studies in fruit flies show that these two proteins influence development, the nervous system and the behaviour of stem cells by switching off the production of certain proteins. To investigate how Nanos and Pumilio work together to regulate protein production, Weidmann, Qiu et al. used a variety of techniques to study the activity of these proteins in cells taken from fruit fly embryos. The experiments reveal that Nanos acts like a clamp to hold Pumilio close to specific RNAs, which allows Pumilio to switch off the production of the corresponding proteins. The presence of Nanos allows Pumilio to regulate RNAs that it cannot bind to alone. Therefore, the experiments show that by working together with Nanos, Pumilio is able to regulate a wider variety of RNAs than it would otherwise be able to. These findings provide a molecular understanding for why fruit fly mutants that lack Nanos or Pumilio have severe body defects and reduced fertility. The next challenge is to identify the specific RNAs targeted by Nanos and Pumilio in stem cells, the nervous system and during development ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nIntermediate neural progenitor cells ( INPs ) need to avoid differentiation and cell cycle exit while maintaining restricted developmental potential, but mechanisms preventing differentiation and cell cycle exit of INPs are not well understood. In this study, we report that the Drosophila homolog of mammalian Sp8 transcription factor Buttonhead ( Btd ) prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of INPs in Drosophila larval type II neuroblast ( NB ) lineages. We show that the loss of Btd leads to elimination of mature INPs due to premature differentiation of INPs into terminally dividing ganglion mother cells. We provide evidence to demonstrate that Btd prevents the premature differentiation by suppressing the expression of the homeodomain protein Prospero in immature INPs. We further show that Btd functions cooperatively with the Ets transcription factor Pointed P1 to promote the generation of INPs. Thus, our work reveals a critical mechanism that prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of Drosophila INPs.  Intermediate neural progenitor cells ( INPs ) play a critical role in increasing the brain size and complexity. Transient amplification of INPs dramatically boosts the neural output from neural stem cells ( NSCs ) ( Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009; Florio and Huttner, 2014 ). Recent studies in developing human brains as well as other mammalian brains suggest that an expansion of the number of transiently amplifying INPs, the outer sub-ventricular zone radial glia-like cells ( oRGs ), likely contributes to the increased cortical size and complexity in humans and other gyrencephalic animals ( Fietz et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2010; Lui et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011 ). On the other hand, accumulating body of evidence suggests that brain tumors could originate from dedifferentiation and unrestricted proliferation of INPs ( Holland et al., 2000; Dai et al., 2001; Walton et al., 2009; Persson et al., 2010; Zong et al., 2012 ). Therefore, it is fundamentally important to understand how the generation and proliferation of INPs are regulated. The recently discovered type II neuroblasts ( NBs, the Drosophila NSCs ) in developing Drosophila larval brains provide an excellent model system for studying mechanisms regulating the generation and proliferation of INPs ( Bello et al., 2008; Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008 ). There are 8 type II NBs in each brain lobe. Like mammalian NSCs, Drosophila type II NBs produce neurons and glia indirectly by generating INPs. Individual INPs undergo 4\u20136 rounds of asymmetric divisions to produce a new INP to self-renew and a ganglion mother cell ( GMC ), which divides terminally to produce neurons and/or glia ( Bayraktar et al., 2010; Viktorin et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2013 ). Meanwhile, individual INPs produce distinct types of neurons by sequentially expressing a set of distinct transcription factors to specify the identity of their progeny ( Bayraktar and Doe, 2013; Wang et al., 2014 ). Through self-renewing divisions, INPs not only amplify the number but also increase the diversity of neural progeny generated from type II NBs. Therefore, the neurogenesis pattern in type II NB lineages is remarkably similar to that in mammalian brains and the Drosophila INPs are functionally analogous to mammalian INPs, particularly oRGs. The generation of INPs in type II NB lineages involves multiple steps ( Bello et al., 2008; Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008 ). Newly generated INPs are immature and do not express any NB markers, such as the proneural protein Asense ( Ase ) or the bHLH protein Deadpan ( Dpn ), except for Miranda ( Mira ). The Ase\u2212 immature INPs first turn on the expression of Ase to become Ase+ immature INPs. Ase+ immature INPs then further differentiate to become mature INPs, which express both Ase and Dpn. INPs do not divide until they are fully mature. The maturation of INPs requires Numb, the NHL family protein Brain tumor ( Brat ), the transcription factor Earmuff ( Erm ), as well as the BAP and Histone deacetylase 3 ( HDAC3 ) chromatin remodeling complexes ( Bowman et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2010; Eroglu et al., 2014; Koe et al., 2014 ). Both Numb and Brat are segregated into Ase\u2212 immature INPs during the division of type II NBs to prevent them from dedifferentiating into NB fate, but they function through independent pathways. Numb inhibits Notch activity in Ase\u2212 immature INPs, whereas Brat likely antagonizes the activity of the EGR family transcription factor Klumpfuss ( Klu ) and Armadillo/\u03b2-Catenin in Ase\u2212 immature INPs ( Bowman et al., 2008; Komori et al., 2014 ). Erm functions together with BAP and HDAC3 chromatin remodeling complexes after Brat and Numb to further restrict the developmental potential of INPs by attenuating the response of INPs to self-renewal factors such as Klu and Dpn ( Janssens et al., 2014; Koe et al., 2014 ). In addition, the BAP chromatin remodeling complex limits the self-renewal of INPs by activating the expression of Prdm protein Hamlet ( Eroglu et al., 2014 ). In the absence of Numb, Brat, Erm, or chromatin remodeling complexes, INPs dedifferentiate into type II NBs and initiate tumorigenic overproliferation ( Bowman et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2010; Eroglu et al., 2014; Koe et al., 2014 ). Therefore, these proteins are critical to prevent dedifferentiation of INPs. However, despite the significant progress on elucidating mechanisms that promote maturation and prevent dedifferentiation of INPs in the past few years, much less is known about why only type II NBs produce self-renewing INPs but not the type I NBs, which produce neurons by generating terminally dividing GMCs. One major difference between INPs and GMCs is that INPs divide to self-renew whereas GMCs divide terminally ( Bello et al., 2008; Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2013 ). Therefore, in addition to avoiding dedifferentiation and unrestricted tumorigenic overproliferation, INPs need to overcome another challenge\u2013to avoid over-differentiation and cell cycle exit\u2013in order to maintain their progenitor state and self-renewal while they differentiate to mature and undergo self-renewing divisions. Type II NBs and newly born Ase\u2212 immature INPs differ from type I NBs and GMCs by the lack of the expression of Ase and the homeodomain protein Prospero ( Pros ) ( Bello et al., 2008; Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008 ). In type I NB lineages, Pros is expressed in the cytoplasm in the NBs and translocates to the nucleus in GMCs to promote differentiation and cell cycle exit by inhibiting NB self-renewing genes and activating neural differentiation genes ( Li and Vaessin, 2000; Choksi et al., 2006 ). In type II NB lineages, Pros is not expressed in the NB or Ase\u2212 immature INPs. In Ase+ immature INPs and mature INPs, Pros is expressed at low levels in the cytoplasm ( Bello et al., 2008; Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008 ). It has been demonstrated that the lack of Ase and Pros in type II NBs and Ase\u2212 immature INPs is essential for the generation of self-renewing INPs in type II NB lineages. Forced expression of Ase or Pros in type II NBs and their progeny is sufficient to eliminate INPs although removing Ase or Pros in type I NBs does not change the identity of type I NBs or induce the generation of INPs ( Bowman et al., 2008; Bayraktar et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2012 ). Our recent studies demonstrated that the Ets family transcription factor Pointed P1 ( PntP1 ) suppresses Ase in type II NBs and is required for the generation of INPs ( Zhu et al., 2011 ). However, mechanisms that prevent premature differentiation of INPs and/or inhibit Pros expression in type II NBs and immature INPs are not known. In this study, we investigate the role of the Sp family transcription factor Buttonhead ( Btd ) in type II NB lineage development. Btd is a homolog of mammalian Sp8 ( Treichel et al., 2003; Estella and Mann, 2010 ). In developing mammalian brains, Sp8 is expressed in neural progenitor cells to regulate forebrain patterning and interneuron development ( Griesel et al., 2006; Waclaw et al., 2006; Sahara et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011 ). In Drosophila embryos, Btd is required for the formation of specific head segments and NB formation ( Wimmer et al., 1993; Younossi-Hartenstein et al., 1997 ). In addition, Sp8/Btd also promotes the growth of limbs and other appendages ( Estella et al., 2003; Treichel et al., 2003; Kawakami et al., 2004; Estella and Mann, 2010 ). In this study, we report that Btd is expressed in type II NB lineages to prevent premature differentiation of INPs into GMCs by suppressing Pros expression in immature INPs. We also demonstrate that PntP1 and Btd function cooperatively to specify type II NB lineages and promote the generation of INPs.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Whereas the majority of cells in the brain are unable to divide to produce new cells, neural stem cells can divide numerous times and have the potential to become many different types of brain cells. However, in between these two extremes there is another group of cells called neural progenitors. These cells can give rise to multiple types of neurons but, in contrast to stem cells, they can undergo only a limited number of divisions. Many of the molecular mechanisms by which stem cells give rise to progenitors are similar in mammals and in the fruit fly Drosophila. In the brains of fruit fly larvae, neural stem cells called neuroblasts give rise to \u2018intermediate neural progenitors', each of which can divide between four and six times. Every division generates a replacement intermediate progenitor and a cell called a GMC, which divides one last time to produce two brain cells. Intermediate progenitors must be tightly regulated to ensure that they undergo an appropriate number of divisions: too few divisions will result in a shortage of cells, disrupting brain development, whereas too many divisions will result in the formation of tumors. Now, using Drosophila brains in the laboratory, Xie et al. \u2014and, independently, Komori et al. \u2014have shown that a protein called \u2018Buttonhead\u2019 is responsible for maintaining this balance. Xie et al. show that deletion of the gene for Buttonhead gene caused the progenitor cells to become GMCs before they had undergone the correct number of divisions. Further experiments revealed that Buttonhead prevents this problem by suppressing a protein called Prospero. The mammalian equivalent of Buttonhead\u2014a protein called Sp8\u2014can substitute for Buttonhead in Drosophila neural progenitors, suggesting that the observed mechanisms may also apply to mammals. Further work is required to test this possibility directly and to examine the involvement of Sp8 in brain development and tumor formation ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nIn the Drosophila circadian clock, Period ( PER ) and Timeless ( TIM ) proteins inhibit Clock-mediated transcription of per and tim genes until PER is degraded by Doubletime/CK1 ( DBT ) -mediated phosphorylation, establishing a negative feedback loop. Multiple regulatory delays within this feedback loop ensure ~24 hr periodicity. Of these delays, the mechanisms that regulate delayed PER degradation ( and Clock reactivation ) remain unclear. Here we show that phosphorylation of certain DBT target sites within a central region of PER affect PER inhibition of Clock and the stability of the PER/TIM complex. Our results indicate that phosphorylation of PER residue S589 stabilizes and activates PER inhibitory function in the presence of TIM, but promotes PER degradation in its absence. The role of DBT in regulating PER activity, stabilization and degradation ensures that these events are chronologically and biochemically linked, and contributes to the timing of an essential delay that influences the period of the circadian clock.  The proteins that comprise circadian clocks are largely conserved across the animal kingdom ( Crane and Young, 2014; Young and Kay, 2001; Zheng and Sehgal, 2012 ). These clocks, which promote daily rhythms in behavior and physiology, involve cell-autonomous, transcription-translation feedback loops that oscillate with\u00a0~24 hr periodicity. In Drosophila, the activator complex consists of dClock/Cycle ( dCLK/CYC ), which initiates transcription of period ( per ) and timeless ( tim ). PER and TIM proteins assemble to form an inhibitory complex in the cytoplasm that, after a delay, enters the nucleus to inhibit dCLK/CYC activity. After a second delay, the inhibitory complex is degraded, freeing the activator complex to reinitiate transcription, closing the feedback loop. Although the delay in transcriptional activation is critical for maintaining\u00a0~24 hr rhythmicity, its regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. A Casein Kinase I/Doubletime ( DBT ) phosphorylation cascade on PER regulates PER protein stability. Current models of this phosphorylation cascade infer that each DBT phosphorylation event gates later phosphorylation events on PER, thus delaying protein degradation and transcriptional activation. The cascade begins with the PER Short Downstream region ( PER-SD, amino acids 604\u2013629 ), which promotes S47 phosphorylation ( Garbe et al., 2013 ). Phosphorylation of S47, is a necessary modification to trigger ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PER by the E3-ligase SLIMB ( Chiu et al., 2008; Garbe et al., 2013; Kivim\u00e4e et al., 2008 ). PER-SD also blocks NEMO kinase from phosphorylating S596. By phosphorylating S596, NEMO promotes S589 phosphorylation by DBT, which blocks S47 phosphorylation ( Chiu et al., 2011; Garbe et al., 2013 ). In other words, PER-SD phosphorylation removes the S589-mediated negative regulation of S47 phosphorylation while independently promoting S47 phosphorylation ( Garbe et al., 2013 ). The purpose of the second regulatory route involving negative regulation of degradation by S589 is unclear. Mutation of the S589 site in flies leads to a short behavioral period ( Baylies et al., 1992; Konopka and Benzer, 1971; Rutila et al., 1992 ). Given that S589 is a DBT phosphorylation site ( Chiu et al., 2008; Kivim\u00e4e et al., 2008 ), it is surprising that mutations that both block ( Gly ) and substitute for phosphorylation ( Asp ) lead to a short behavioral rhythm ( Rutila et al., 1992 ). Although this may suggest that the aspartate residue substitution does not serve as an effective phosphomimetic, the fact that the behavioral period of the mimetic is longer than a mutant that prevents phosphorylation ( Gly ) suggests a more complex regulatory mechanism. TIM binding to PER adds another layer of complexity to the model by protecting PER from hyperphosphorylation and degradation ( Kloss et al., 2001 ). This suggests that the DBT phosphorylation cascade on PER is influenced by TIM. The sites that comprise the cascade were identified using either purified protein ( Kivim\u00e4e et al., 2008 ) or PER protein expressed alone, in cultured Drosophila embryonic ( S2 ) cells ( Chiu et al., 2008 ), concealing the identity of the sites that would have been protected by TIM, or overlooking sites that would have been phosphorylated in the presence of TIM. Thus, how the DBT phosphorylation cascade operates in the context of a complex is largely undetermined. It is generally assumed that inhibition of dCLK is gated by nuclear accumulation of PER, and release of dCLK inhibition occurs passively, through PER degradation. PER phosphorylation, PER degradation and PER inhibitory activity coincide closely in time and space ( Abruzzi et al., 2011; Edery et al., 1994 ), which has led to a model in which PER stability and inhibitory activity are regulated by the same regulatory mechanism ( Kivim\u00e4e et al., 2008 ). An alternative possibility is that the different functions of PER ( transcription inhibition and degradation ), are independently regulated by different programs of phosphorylation that occur concurrently or nearly so. This possibility has been difficult to test, due to the challenges of monitoring PER phosphorylation, transcriptional activity and protein stability simultaneously. In this study, we propose a new model for the regulation of PER by DBT, which includes separable features affecting PER stability and activity. Our findings suggest that the DBT/PER/TIM complex is interdependent in the initial stages of dCLK/CYC inhibition. We show that the initial sites of DBT phosphorylation stabilize the PER/TIM inhibitor complex and activate transcriptional inhibition. The classic per short site S589 serves two functions: first to stabilize the activated PER inhibitor in the presence of TIM and then to mediate its degradation after TIM is degraded. We propose a dual role for DBT in regulating the circadian clock. ( 1 ) In the nucleus DBT activates function of the PER/TIM complex as a transcriptional inhibitor and stabilizes it, ( 2 ) subsequently promoting PER degradation by midday. The dual function of DBT links PER/TIM inhibitory activity and stability, biochemically and chronologically, and underlies a key delay in the circadian clock that helps establish 24 hr behavioral rhythmicity.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Many behaviors, such as when we fall asleep or wake up, follow the rhythm of day and night. This is regulated in part by our \u2018circadian clock\u2019, which controls biological processes through the timed activation of hundreds of genes over the 24-hour day. In fruit flies, the proteins that form the core of the circadian clock activate and repress each other in such a way that their expression oscillates over a 24-hour cycle. During the late afternoon and early evening, the Clock protein initiates the production of proteins Period and Timeless: these two molecules then accumulate in the cell, and after binding to each other, they are transported into the nucleus. During the late night and early morning, this Period/Timeless complex inhibits the activity of Clock. After a delay, Period and Timeless are degraded. This allows Clock to be reactivated, restarting the cycle for the next day. Period is critical to help maintain the 24-hour oscillation shown by these proteins. A protein called Doubletime is responsible for making a number of chemical modifications on Period. It is unclear how these changes interact with each other, and how they influence the stability and function of Period when it is associated with Timeless. Here, Top et al. generate mutations in the fruit fly gene period to study these processes, and develop a new biomolecular technique to monitor the stability and activity of Period protein in insect cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments reveal new roles for the chemical changes made by Doubletime to Period. First, after Period associates with Timeless, Doubletime triggers certain modifications that lead to Period being able to inactivate Clock. Second, Doubletime makes another change in a nearby region of Period that results in the Period/Timeless complex being stabilized. Both sets of modifications help the complex to stay active and keep inhibiting Clock for long enough such that a 24-hour rhythm can be maintained. Finally, when Timeless is degraded, Period is released from the complex. At this time, the modifications made by Doubletime promote the degradation of Period, resetting the clock. Fruit flies with mutations that block this mechanism perceive the day as shorter. This shows that the smallest change to clock genes can disorganize behavior. Indeed in humans, health problems such as sleep or mental health disorders are associated with irregular circadian clocks. Understanding the biochemical mechanisms that keep the body clocks ticking could help to find new therapeutic targets for these conditions ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe auditory pathway faithfully encodes and relays auditory information to the brain with remarkable speed and precision. The inner hair cells ( IHCs ) are the primary sensory receptors adapted for rapid auditory signaling, but they are not thought to be intrinsically tuned to encode particular sound frequencies. Here I found that under experimental conditions mimicking those in vivo, mammalian IHCs are intrinsically specialized. Low-frequency gerbil IHCs ( ~0. 3 kHz ) have significantly more depolarized resting membrane potentials, faster kinetics, and shorter membrane time constants than high-frequency cells ( ~30 kHz ). The faster kinetics of low-frequency IHCs allow them to follow the phasic component of sound ( frequency-following ), which is not required for high-frequency cells that are instead optimally configured to encode sustained, graded responses ( intensity-following ). The intrinsic membrane filtering of IHCs ensures accurate encoding of the phasic or sustained components of the cell\u2019s in vivo receptor potential, crucial for sound localization and ultimately survival.  Sound pressure waves are used by many animal species to gain sensory input from their environment that is vital for their survival and communication. The sensory receptors of the auditory system, the hair cells, are responsible for the transduction of sound waves into electrical signals that travel along the auditory pathway. The mechanosensory apparatus of hair cells is the stereociliary hair bundle that protrudes from their apical surface in the form of a staircase-like structure ( Schwander et al., 2010 ). Mechano-sensitive ion channels are positioned near the tip of the shorter rows of stereocilia ( Beurg et al., 2009 ), the opening of which initiates a receptor potential that is shaped by voltage and ion-gated ion channels in the hair cell\u2019s basolateral membrane. The receptor potential activates the Ca2+ channels in the basal pole of the cell that trigger the release of neurotransmitter onto afferent terminals ( Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002 ), so that sound information is conveyed to the higher auditory brain areas. Auditory hair cells in lower\u00a0vertebrates such as the turtle and bullfrog ( Fettiplace and Fuchs, 1999 ), where the hearing sensitivity spans a generally low-frequency range ( from around 100\u2009Hz to 1 kHz ), show intrinsic membrane tuning such that the membrane potential oscillates at the cells\u2019 characteristic frequency ( CF ). In these animals, the interplay between the Ca2+ and Ca2+-activated K+ channels, which are differentially expressed along the auditory organ, are thought to be the main mechanism determining hair cell frequency selectivity ( Hudspeth and Lewis 1988; Wu et al., 1995 ). The mammalian auditory system has evolved to be able to encode a much wider dynamic range of sound frequencies and intensities. In order to do this, mammals have developed an elaborate auditory organ where much of the frequency tuning is carried out by the mechanics of the basilar membrane ( Robles and Ruggero, 2001 ) and electromotility of the outer hair cells ( OHCs ) ( Brownell et al., 1985; Ashmore, 1987 ) driven by the motor protein prestin ( Liberman et al., 2002; Dallos et al., 2006 ). These morphological and functional differences along the mammalian cochlea produce a tonotopic place-frequency map that is preserved throughout the\u00a0auditory pathway. Thus the main sensory receptors, the inner hair cells ( IHCs ), are believed not to show intrinsic tuning in mammals ( Marcotti et al., 2003 ), although recent studies have shown tonotopic differences in the Ca2+ currents ( Johnson and Marcotti, 2008 ), the size of Ca2+ hotspots at ribbon synapses ( Meyer et al., 2009 ), and Ca2+ dependence of exocytosis ( Johnson et al., 2008 ) along the cochlea. Moreover, the in vivo receptor potentials of low and high-frequency mammalian IHCs differ because of the relative filtering properties of the cells\u2019 basolateral membrane. Low-frequency IHCs ( up to a few kilohertz ) have a predominantly phasic ( AC ) component that follows the stimulation frequency and is graded in size to the intensity ( Dallos, 1985 ). The receptor potentials of high-frequency cells cannot follow the sound stimulus and as such do not have a large phasic component. Instead, they have a predominantly sustained ( DC ) component that is the average depolarization resulting when there is an asymmetric transduction current and it oscillates too fast for the cell membrane potential to keep up. The DC component is graded in size to sound intensity ( Russell and Sellick, 1978 ). In the present study, I have investigated the biophysical properties of mature gerbil IHCs under near physiological recording conditions in low-frequency ( apical turn: ~300\u2009Hz ) and high-frequency ( basal turn: ~30 kHz ) regions of the cochlea. The results show that the size of the resting mechanotransducer ( MT ) current and the composition of basolateral membrane currents are optimized to confer low- and high-frequency IHCs with different resting membrane potentials ( Vm ) and kinetics\u00a0in vivo. These biophysical differences allow apical IHCs to follow precisely the phasic component of sound, while basal cells are able to accurately encode the sustained and graded component of high-frequency stimuli, providing direct evidence for the existence of intrinsic filtering in mammalian cochlear IHCs.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Many animals\u2019 survival depends on them accurately and quickly identifying sounds in their environment. In animals with backbones, cells with hair-like projections ( called hair cells ) inside the ear convert information collected from sound waves into electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted to the brain, which processes the information further. Animals like bullfrogs are adapted to hearing low frequency sounds, like their own mating calls. These frog\u2019s hair cells are individually tuned so that they can capture sounds in this low frequency range. Mammals, on the other hand, have evolved to hear a much wider range of sounds from loud and low frequency sounds, such as thunder, to soft and high frequency sounds, like the cries of their young. In mammals, the part of inner ear involved in hearing ( called the cochlea ) has an elaborate spiral-like shape. The structure of the cochlea results in different frequencies of sound being transformed by the hair cells into electrical signals at different points around the spiral. Because of this, most researchers didn\u2019t think that hair cells in mammals were individually tuned like those in bullfrogs. Now, Stuart Johnson demonstrates that hair cells in different parts of the gerbil\u2019s cochlea are specialized for encoding sounds of specific frequencies. In conditions that mimic the environment inside the ear, a very precise jet of fluid was used to stimulate single hair cells in a similar way to a sound wave. The experiments then compared how hair cells from the upper and lower parts of the cochlea\u2019s spiral responded. Johnson found that hair cells from the upper portion of the gerbils\u2019 cochlea are specialized to capture low frequency sounds. They have electrical properties that allow them to quickly transmit information to the brain about low frequency sounds. In the lower portion of the cochlea, hair cells are specialized to capture high frequency sounds. That is, their electrical properties make it easier for these hair cells to transmit detailed information to the brain about the volume of high frequency sounds. Together, these findings help explain how these animals are able to localize sounds, which requires capturing both the timing and intensity of different types of sounds ."}

The region shows high conservation between human and mouse and contains multiple MYC enhancers that are activated in tumor cells. However, the role of this region in normal development has not been addressed. Here we show that a 538 kb deletion of the entire MYC upstream super-enhancer region in mice results in 50% to 80% decrease in Myc expression in multiple tissues. The mice are viable and show no overt phenotype. However, they are resistant to tumorigenesis, and most normal cells isolated from them grow slowly in culture. These results reveal that only cells whose MYC activity is increased by serum or oncogenic driver mutations depend on the 8q24 super-enhancer region, and indicate that targeting the activity of this element is a promising strategy of cancer chemoprevention and therapy.  Deregulated expression of the MYC oncogene is associated with many cancer types ( Reviewed in Albihn et al., 2010; Dang, 2012; Evan, 2012 ). MYC acts primarily as a transcriptional activator that increases expression of many genes required for RNA and protein synthesis above the level that is required in resting cells. In cancer cells, aberrantly elevated levels of MYC drive global amplification of transcription rates, providing the cells with necessary resources for rapid proliferation ( see, for example Brown et al., 2008; van Riggelen et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2012; Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014; Walz et al., 2014 ). Transcription of the MYC gene is regulated by a diverse array of regulatory elements located both upstream and downstream of the MYC transcription start site ( TSS ). Variants in the MYC upstream region contribute to inherited susceptibility to most major forms of human cancer, and account for a very large number of cancer cases at the population level ( Amundadottir et al., 2006; Gudmundsson et al., 2007; Yeager et al., 2007; Al Olama et al., 2009; Yeager et al., 2009 ). For example, the polymorphism rs6983267 linked to colorectal ( Tomlinson et al., 2007 ) and prostate ( Yeager et al., 2007 ) cancers contributes more to cancer morbidity and mortality than any other known inherited variant or mutation, including the inherited mutations in classic tumor suppressors such as RB, TP53 and APC. Through computational and experimental analyses, we and others have shown that the risk allele G of rs6983267 creates a strong binding site for the colorectal-cancer associated transcription factor Tcf7l2 ( Pomerantz et al., 2009; Tuupanen et al., 2009 ). This binding site is located within the Myc-335 enhancer element that is dispensable for mouse viability, but required for efficient Tcf7l2-driven intestinal tumorigenesis ( Sur et al., 2012b ). More recently, another enhancer element, located 1. 47 Mb downstream of Myc was shown to be required for formation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) in mice ( Herranz et al., 2014 ). However, in contrast to the Myc-335 element, this element is also required for normal T-cell development. Thus, the mechanism by which individual Myc enhancer elements contribute to normal development and tumorigenesis is still unclear. Several studies have shown that the 8q24 region contains a large number of additional enhancer elements ( see, for example [Hallikas et al., 2006; Ahmadiyeh et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2014] ) and super-enhancers that are active in many different types of human cancer ( Hnisz et al., 2013; Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015 ). The MYC-associated super-enhancers are activated during the process of tumorigenesis ( Hnisz et al., 2013 ), and downregulation of super-enhancer activity leads to selective inhibition of MYC expression ( Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013 ). Thus, MYC-associated super-enhancer activity is required for tumorigenesis, but the role of these elements in normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis has been unclear. To address this problem, we have in this work generated multiple mouse strains deficient of regulatory elements upstream of the Myc promoter. Since this region contains multiple tumor type and tissue -specific enhancers and super-enhancers, for the sake of clarity we refer to the deleted region here as the `super-enhancer region\u00b4. By analysis of the mice, we found that the entire super-enhancer region conferring multi-cancer susceptibility contributes to MYC expression in vivo, yet is not required for mouse embryonic development and viability. However, this region is required for the growth of normal cells in culture and cancer cells in vivo. As cultured cells are exposed to serum, which is a signal of tissue damage, this finding suggests that tumor cells and cells responding to damage signals share regulatory mechanisms that are dispensable for normal physiological growth control.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Our cells each contain close to 20, 000 genes, which provide the instructions needed to build our bodies and keep us alive. At any one time in the life of the cell, only some of these genes are active. The activity of each gene is constantly regulated to allow the cell to respond to changes in its environment. Enhancers are sections of DNA, outside of the genes, that act as molecular switches controlling the activity of genes. A gene can have many such enhancers; each enhancer is linked to a particular set of signals and having multiple enhancers allows the same gene to be activated by different signals in different tissues in the body. Changes to enhancers can have serious consequences. By altering the activity of genes, an enhancer can have widespread effects on the health and behavior of a cell, including transforming it from healthy to cancerous. The small differences in enhancers also make some people more susceptible to cancers than others. If we can identify enhancers whose activity is commonly altered in cancers, it could be possible to target them through treatment. Yet, it is not clear whether targeting enhancers in this way could be effectively used to treat cancer without damaging healthy cells. Now, Dave, Sur et al. have examined a large enhancer region with known links to several different cancers \u2013 including prostate, breast and colon cancers \u2013 to uncover whether it also plays a critical role in healthy cells and if it could be safely targeted for treatment. The region has multiple enhancers for a cancer-linked gene called MYC and is implicated in many cancer-associated deaths every year. This particular enhancer region is found in both humans and mice, which share many genes in common. Using genetic engineering, Dave, Sur et al. removed this enhancer region from the genetic information of a group of mice. The experiment showed that mice without the enhancer region were completely healthy. Also, when tested for cancer development, these mice were much less susceptible to several major types of cancer. This investigation reveals that it may be possible to create drugs to shut down or inhibit certain enhancers to prevent or treat cancer without damaging healthy cells. However, this is currently just one example in mice under laboratory conditions. Further research is needed to determine if a similar approach can be developed to treat patients in the clinic ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nCommunication between pre- and postsynaptic cells promotes the initial organization of synaptic specializations, but subsequent synaptic stabilization requires transcriptional regulation. Here we show that fibroblast growth factor 22 ( FGF22 ), a target-derived presynaptic organizer in the mouse hippocampus, induces the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ) for the stabilization of presynaptic terminals. FGF22 is released from CA3 pyramidal neurons and organizes the differentiation of excitatory nerve terminals formed onto them. Local application of FGF22 on the axons of dentate granule cells ( DGCs ), which are presynaptic to CA3 pyramidal neurons, induces IGF2 in the DGCs. IGF2, in turn, localizes to DGC presynaptic terminals and stabilizes them in an activity-dependent manner. IGF2 application rescues presynaptic defects of Fgf22-/- cultures. IGF2 is dispensable for the initial presynaptic differentiation, but is required for the following presynaptic stabilization both in vitro and in vivo. These results reveal a novel feedback signal that is critical for the activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mammalian hippocampus.  Synapses are the sites of neuronal communication in the brain. Proper synapse formation is critical for appropriate brain function; aberrant synaptic connectivity may result in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as autism, Fragile X syndrome, epilepsy, and schizophrenia ( Banerjee et al., 2014; Casillas-Espinosa et al., 2012; Lisman, 2012; Pfeiffer and Huber, 2009 ). Synapse formation begins with target recognition by axons, which is followed by synaptic differentiation at the contact sites. Synaptic differentiation is regulated by signals that are exchanged between pre- and postsynaptic sites. Various target-derived presynaptic organizers, such as fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ), WNTs, neurotrophins, neuroligins, Ephs/ephrins, SynCAMs, netrin-G ligands ( NGLs ), and signal regulatory proteins ( SIRPs ) are shown to promote local differentiation of presynaptic terminals ( Darabid et al., 2014; Fox and Umemori, 2006; Henriquez et al., 2011; Johnson-Venkatesh and Umemori, 2010; Regehr et al., 2009; Salinas, 2012; Shen and Scheiffele, 2010; Siddiqui and Craig, 2011; Toth et al., 2013; Zweifel et al., 2005 ). Initial synapses thereafter maturate, resulting in a more stable, functional, and finely tuned neural network ( Goda and Davis, 2003; Waites et al., 2005; West and Greenberg, 2011 ). Presynaptic stabilization has been shown to require gene expression. At the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ), a retrograde signal initiated by glass bottom boat ( Gbb ), the Drosophila homologue of bone morphogenic protein ( BMP ), controls presynaptic growth and stabilization through transcriptional regulation in motor neurons. During this process, Gbb and its receptor are internalized and transported from the nerve terminal to the cell body as a retrograde signal. This signal then activates a transcription factor, Mothers against decapentaplegic ( Mad ) ( Aberle et al., 2002; Marqu\u00e9s et al., 2002; McCabe et al., 2003 ). Activated Mad regulates transcription of genes including Trio and dfmr1 ( fly homolog of FMR1 ). Trio and dFMR1 play critical roles in modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics and stabilizing microtubules in the presynaptic motor neurons, leading to presynaptic growth and stabilization ( Ball et al., 2010; Nahm et al., 2013 ). In the mammalian brain, changes in gene expression, as a consequence of axon\u2013dendrite contacts, are also likely to contribute to presynaptic stabilization. For example, expression of genes encoding vesicle proteins increases soon after synaptogenesis begins, and neurons synthesize different isoforms of vesicle proteins before and after their axons contact targets ( Campagna et al., 1997; Lou and Bixby, 1995; Plunkett et al., 1998; Sanes and Lichtman, 1999 ). In addition, synaptic stabilization is influenced by neural activity ( Ackermann et al., 2015; Chia et al., 2013; Dalva et al., 2007; Lichtman and Colman, 2000; Ruthazer and Cline, 2004; Waites et al., 2005 ). However, it is not known whether and how target-derived molecules control gene transcription in the presynaptic neurons for the stabilization of presynaptic terminals, and whether such a pathway is regulated by neural activity. We have previously found that FGF22 serves as a target-derived presynaptic organizer in the mouse hippocampus, a key brain region associated with learning, memory, emotional processing, and social behavior. FGF22 is released from CA3 pyramidal neurons and promotes local differentiation of the excitatory presynaptic terminals formed onto them ( Terauchi et al., 2010; 2015 ). FGF22-dependent presynaptic differentiation requires two FGF receptors ( FGFRs ), FGFR2b and FGFR1b, in dentate granule cells ( DGCs ), the major presynaptic neurons for CA3 pyramidal neurons, and the downstream signaling molecules FGFR substrate 2 ( FRS2 ) and PI-3 kinase ( Dabrowski et al., 2015 ). Signals mediated by FRS2 and PI-3 kinase are known to regulate gene expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that FGF22 signaling eventually regulates gene expression and that those FGF22-induced molecules, in turn, contribute to the stabilization of presynaptic terminals. Here, we identified FGF22 target genes in the presynaptic DGCs and asked whether the target genes contribute to presynaptic stabilization. We find that i ) target-derived FGF22 signaling induces the expression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 ( Igf2 ) gene in DGCs, ii ) IGF2 then localizes to presynaptic terminals of DGCs and stabilizes them, iii ) the transportation of IGF2 to the presynaptic terminal is activity-dependent, and iv ) IGF2 is not required for the initial presynaptic differentiation, but is required for subsequent presynaptic stabilization both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, FGF22 is a target-derived molecule not only organizing local, initial presynaptic differentiation, but also regulating IGF2 expression in the presynaptic neurons. IGF2, in turn, contributes to presynaptic stabilization in an activity-dependent manner. Our results reveal a novel feedback signal that is critical for the activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mammalian brain.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Nerve cells in the developing brain must organize themselves into complex networks by forming appropriate connections with one another. These connections are known as synapses, and they assemble via two critical stages. First, a new synapse forms, and then it stabilizes. This first stage is a localized event that involves the contact site between the two nerve cells, while the stabilization of a synapse requires the expression of genes in a nerve cell\u2019s nucleus. Furthermore, only active synapses may be stabilized. Many synapses form in a region of the brain called the hippocampus, which plays a key role in learning and memory. A protein called fibroblast growth factor 22 ( or FGF22 for short ) helps synapses to initially form within the hippocampus. However, much less is known about the signals that regulate the stabilization of synapses and the genes that are involved. It is also not clear if these genes might be controlled by FGF22 signaling. To address these questions, Terauchi et al. searched the mouse hippocampus for genes with expression that depended on FGF22 signaling. One gene in particular, which encodes a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ), was much less expressed in mice that lack FGF22 compared to normal mice. Further experiments revealed that only active nerve cells transport IGF2 to synapses, and that IGF2 helps to stabilize these structures. By contrast, IGF2 is not required for synapse to initially form. This indicates that FGF22 controls both the formation and stabilization of synapses, and that it controls the first stage directly, and the second stage indirectly via its effects on IGF2 expression. Terauchi et al. also showed that FGF22-IGF2 signaling is not involved in the stabilization of all synapses in the mouse hippocampus. Instead, synapses between different types of nerve cell appear to use distinct signals for synapse formation and stabilization. A key topic for future studies will be to understand these specific signals and how they cooperate in the brain to establish precise networks of nerve cells ."}

However, little is known about the molecular pathways involved in platelet recruitment to the liver and whether targeting such pathways could attenuate AILI. Mice were fasted overnight before intraperitoneally ( i. p. ) injected with APAP at a dose of 210 mg/kg for male mice and 325 mg/kg for female mice. Platelets adherent to Kupffer cells were determined in both mice and patients overdosed with APAP. The impact of \u03b1-chitinase 3-like-1 ( \u03b1-Chi3l1 ) on alleviation of AILI was determined in a therapeutic setting, and liver injury was analyzed. The present study unveiled a critical role of Chi3l1 in hepatic platelet recruitment during AILI. Increased Chi3l1 and platelets in the liver were observed in patients and mice overdosed with APAP. Compared to wild-type ( WT ) mice, Chil1-/- mice developed attenuated AILI with markedly reduced hepatic platelet accumulation. Mechanistic studies revealed that Chi3l1 signaled through CD44 on macrophages to induce podoplanin expression, which mediated platelet recruitment through C-type lectin-like receptor 2. Moreover, APAP treatment of Cd44-/- mice resulted in much lower numbers of hepatic platelets and liver injury than WT mice, a phenotype similar to that in Chil1-/- mice. Recombinant Chi3l1 could restore hepatic platelet accumulation and AILI in Chil1-/- mice, but not in Cd44-/- mice. Importantly, we generated anti-Chi3l1 monoclonal antibodies and demonstrated that they could effectively inhibit hepatic platelet accumulation and AILI. We uncovered the Chi3l1/CD44 axis as a critical pathway mediating APAP-induced hepatic platelet recruitment and tissue injury. We demonstrated the feasibility and potential of targeting Chi3l1 to treat AILI. ZS received funding from NSFC ( 32071129 ). FWL received funding from NIH ( GM123261 ).

DeBakey VA Medical Center and funding from Department of Veterans Affairs I01 BX002551 ( Equipment, Personnel, Supplies ). The contents do not represent the views of the US Department of Veterans Affairs or the US Government.  Acute liver failure ( ALF ) is a life-threatening condition of massive hepatocyte injury and severe liver dysfunction that can result in multi-organ failure and death ( Bernal and Wendon, 2013 ). Acetaminophen ( APAP ) overdose is the leading cause of ALF in Europe and North America and responsible for more cases of ALF than all other aetiologies combined ( Bernal and Wendon, 2013; Jaeschke, 2015 ). It is estimated that each week, more than 50 million Americans use products containing APAP and approximately 30, 000 patients are admitted to intensive care units every year due to APAP-induced liver injury ( AILI ) ( Bernal and Wendon, 2013; Blieden et al., 2014 ). Although N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) can prevent liver injury if given in time, there are still 30% of patients who do not respond to NAC ( Fisher and Curry, 2019 ). Thus, identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies is imperative. APAP is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 2E1 ( CYP2E1 ) to a reactive toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine ( NAPQI ). NAPQI causes mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and eventually cell death ( Hinson et al., 2004 ). The initial direct toxicity of APAP triggers the cascades of coagulation and inflammation, contributing to the progression and exacerbation of AILI ( Hinson et al., 2004 ). In patients with APAP overdose, the clinical observations of thrombocytopenia, reduced plasma fibrinogen levels, elevated thrombin-antithrombin, and increased levels of pro-coagulation microparticles strongly suggest concurrent coagulopathy ( Stravitz et al., 2013; Stravitz et al., 2016 ). Similarly, APAP challenge in mice causes a rapid activation of the coagulation cascade and significant deposition of fibrin ( ogen ) in the liver ( Groeneveld et al., 2020; Sullivan et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2013 ). With regard to the role of platelets in AILI, it is reported that in mice APAP-induced thrombocytopenia correlates with the accumulation of platelets in the liver and that platelet\u00a0depletion significantly attenuates AILI ( Miyakawa et al., 2015 ). Two recent studies also demonstrate that persistent platelet accumulation in the liver delays tissue repair after AILI in mice ( Chauhan et al., 2020; Groeneveld et al., 2020 ). These findings strongly indicate that hepatic platelet accumulation is a key mechanism contributing to AILI. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism of APAP-induced hepatic platelet accumulation and whether targeting this process could attenuate AILI. Chitinase 3-like-1 ( Chi3l1 ) ( YKL-40 in humans ) is a chitinase-like soluble protein without chitinase activities ( Lee et al., 2011 ). It is produced by multiple cell types, including macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts, synovial cells, endothelial cells, and tumor cells ( Hakala et al., 1993; Kawada et al., 2007 ). Chi3l1 has been implicated in multiple biological processes including apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, infection, and tumor metastasis ( Lee et al., 2009 ). Elevated serum levels of Chi3l1 have been observed in various liver diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma ( Kumagai et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2011; N\u00f8jgaard et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2020 ). However, the biological function of Chi3l1 in liver disease is not clear. Our previous study revealed an important role of Chi3l1 in promoting intrahepatic coagulation in concanavalin A-induced hepatitis ( Shan et al., 2018 ). Given the importance of intrahepatic coagulation in the mechanism of AILI, we wondered whether Chi3l1 is involved in platelets accumulation during AILI. In the current study, we observed elevated levels of Chi3l1 in patients with APAP-induced ALF and in mice challenged with APAP overdose. Our data demonstrated a central role of Chi3l1 in APAP-induced hepatic platelet recruitment through CD44. Importantly, we found that targeting Chi3l1 by monoclonal antibodies could effectively inhibit platelet accumulation in the liver and markedly attenuate AILI.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Acetaminophen, also called paracetamol outside the United States, is a commonly used painkiller, with over 50 million people in the United States taking the drug weekly. While paracetamol is safe at standard doses, overdose can cause acute liver failure, which leads to 30, 000 patients being admitted to emergency care in the United States each year. There is only one approved antidote to overdoses, which becomes significantly less effective if its application is delayed by more than a few hours. This has incentivized research into identify new drug targets that could lead to additional treatment options. Acetaminophen overdose triggers blood clotting and inflammation, contributing to liver injury. It also causes a decrease in cells called platelets circulating in the blood, which has been observed in both mice and humans. In mice, this occurs because platelets accumulate in the liver. Removing these excess cells appears to reduce the severity of the damage caused by acetaminophen, but it remains unclear how the drug triggers their accumulation in the liver. In 2018, researchers showed that a protein called Chi3l1 plays an important role in another form of liver damage. Shan et al. \u2013 including many of the researchers involved in the 2018 study \u2013 have examined whether the protein also contributes to acetaminophen damage in the liver. Shan et al. showed that mice lacking the gene that codes for Chi3l1 developed less severe liver injury and had fewer platelets in the liver following acetaminophen overdose. They also found that human patients with acute liver failure due to acetaminophen had high levels of Chi3l1 and significant accumulation of platelets in the liver. To test whether damage could be prevented, Shan et al. used antibodies to neutralize Chi3l1 in mice after giving them an acetaminophen overdose. This reduced platelet accumulation in the liver and the associated damage. These findings suggest that targeting Chi3l1 may be an effective strategy to prevent liver damage caused by acetaminophen overdose. Further research could help develop new treatments for acetaminophen-induced liver injury and perhaps other liver conditions ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMillions of neurons drive the activity of hundreds of muscles, meaning many different neural population activity patterns could generate the same movement. Studies have suggested that these redundant ( i. e. behaviorally equivalent ) activity patterns may be beneficial for neural computation. However, it is unknown what constraints may limit the selection of different redundant activity patterns. We leveraged a brain-computer interface, allowing us to define precisely which neural activity patterns were redundant. Rhesus monkeys made cursor movements by modulating neural activity in primary motor cortex. We attempted to predict the observed distribution of redundant neural activity. Principles inspired by work on muscular redundancy did not accurately predict these distributions. Surprisingly, the distributions of redundant neural activity and task-relevant activity were coupled, which enabled accurate predictions of the distributions of redundant activity. This suggests limits on the extent to which redundancy may be exploited by the brain for computation.  Neural circuits relay information from one population of neurons to another. This relay involves successive stages of downstream neurons reading out the activity of upstream neurons. In many cases, the same activity in the downstream population can be produced by different population activity patterns in the upstream population, a phenomenon termed neural redundancy. Redundancy is ubiquitous in neural computation, from sensory input to motor output. For example, during a task where subjects need to discriminate the color of a stimulus while ignoring its orientation ( Mante et al., 2013 ), population activity patterns corresponding to the same color but different orientations are read out equivalently, and are therefore redundant. There is mounting evidence that redundancy in readouts may provide various computational benefits. For example, neural redundancy may allow us to prepare movements without executing them ( Kaufman et al., 2014; Elsayed et al., 2016 ), enable stable computation despite unstable neural dynamics ( Driscoll et al., 2017; Druckmann and Chklovskii, 2012; Murray et al., 2017 ) and allow the central nervous system to filter out unwanted noise ( Moreno-Bote et al., 2014 ). To fully utilize the proposed benefits of neural redundancy, the population activity should be allowed to freely vary, as long as the readout of this activity remains consistent with task demands. This would allow the population activity to perform computations that are not reflected in the readout. However, a commonly held assumption is that neural activity might also be constrained by energetics: All things being equal, if two population activity patterns are read out equivalently, the brain should prefer the pattern that requires less energy to produce ( Laughlin et al., 1998; Barlow, 1969; Levy and Baxter, 1996 ). These two lines of reasoning raise the following questions: What principles guide the production of redundant neural activity patterns ? Are there constraints on which redundant activity patterns can be produced ? If so, this may limit the extent to which neural circuits can exploit the proposed computational benefits of redundancy. Redundancy has been studied extensively in motor control ( Lashley, 1933; Bernstein, 1967 ), albeit in terms of muscular redundancy rather than neural redundancy. During arm movements, different combinations of muscle activity can lead to the same arm kinematics, meaning these different muscle activity patterns are redundant. Previous work on this muscle redundancy problem has identified two principles guiding the selection of redundant muscle activity. First, because muscle contraction requires energy in the form of ATP, the selected muscle activity should require minimum energy relative to the other redundant options ( Thoroughman and Shadmehr, 1999; Huang et al., 2012; Fagg et al., 2002 ). Second, a minimal intervention strategy has been proposed in which subjects control only the aspects of muscle activity that influence the task outcome, and allow for variability in the aspects of muscle activity that do not influence the task outcome ( Scholz and Sch\u00f6ner, 1999; Todorov and Jordan, 2002; Valero-Cuevas et al., 2009 ). To generate movements, the brain not only needs to deal with muscle redundancy, but also neural redundancy, which has been less studied. One way in which neural redundancy can arise is when there are more elements ( neurons or muscles ) upstream than downstream. During arm movements, the activity of around thirty muscles in the arm and hand is controlled by tens of thousands of\u00a0neurons in the spinal cord ( Gray, 1918; Feinstein et al., 1955 ). Those neurons are in turn influenced by millions of neurons in the primary motor cortex and other motor areas ( Ettema et al., 1998; Lemon, 2008 ). Thus, the neural control of arm movement is redundant ( Figure 1A ), in that different population activity patterns can generate the same movement ( Rokni et al., 2007; Ajemian et al., 2013 ). Can the principles of muscular redundancy inform our understanding of neural redundancy ? A common challenge in studying neural redundancy is that it is typically not known which neural activity patterns are redundant, because we do not know how downstream neurons or muscles read out information. In this study we overcome this problem by leveraging a brain-computer interface ( BCI ), in which the activity of dozens of neurons is read out as movements of a cursor on a computer screen ( Figure 1B ) ( Taylor et al., 2002; Carmena et al., 2003; Hochberg et al., 2006; Ganguly and Carmena, 2009; Gilja et al., 2012; Hauschild et al., 2012; Sadtler et al., 2014 ). A key advantage of a BCI is that the readout of the population activity ( termed the BCI mapping ) is fully known and defined by the experimenter ( Golub et al., 2016 ). This allows us to determine precisely the redundant population activity patterns, which\u00a0are those that move the cursor in exactly the same way. To illustrate this, consider a simplified example where the activity of two neurons controls a 1D cursor velocity ( Figure 1C ). The two dark green activity patterns produce the same cursor movement ( v1 ), and the two light green patterns produce a different movement ( v2 ). We can decompose any population activity pattern into two orthogonal components: output-potent activity and output-null activity ( Figure 1C, black axes ) ( Kaufman et al., 2014; Law et al., 2014 ). The output-potent component determines the cursor\u2019s movement, whereas the output-null component has no effect on the cursor. Two population activity patterns are redundant if they have the same output-potent activity, but different output-null activity ( e. g. the dark green square and circle on the 'v1' dotted line in Figure 1C ). The question we address here is, which redundant population activity patterns are preferred by the nervous system ? To answer this, we assessed the distribution of output-null activity produced during each cursor movement ( Figure 1D ), and compared it to what we would expect to observe under each of several candidate hypotheses for explaining neural redundancy. We trained three Rhesus macaques to perform a brain-computer interface task in which they controlled the velocity of a cursor on a computer screen by volitionally modulating neural activity in primary motor cortex. To understand the principles guiding the selection of redundant neural activity, we compared the observed distributions of output-null activity to those predicted by three different hypotheses. The first two hypotheses we considered were inspired by studies of muscle redundancy. First, by analogy to minimum energy principles ( Thoroughman and Shadmehr, 1999; Huang et al., 2012; Fagg et al., 2002 ), neural activity may minimize unnecessary spiking ( Barlow, 1969; Levy and Baxter, 1996 ). Second, by analogy to the minimal intervention strategy ( Scholz and Sch\u00f6ner, 1999; Todorov and Jordan, 2002; Valero-Cuevas et al., 2009 ), output-null activity might be uncontrolled ( i. e. output-potent activity is modified independently of output-null activity ) because neural variability in this space has no effect on cursor movement. Third, we considered the possibility that the distribution of redundant activity may be coupled with the task-relevant activity, so that producing particular activity patterns in output-potent dimensions requires changing the distribution of activity in output-null dimensions. We tested all hypotheses in terms of their ability to predict the distribution of output-null activity, given the output-potent activity. Hypotheses were tested within the space in which the population activity naturally resides, termed the intrinsic manifold ( Sadtler et al., 2014 ). The results of Sadtler et al. ( 2014 ) indicate that neural activity cannot readily leave this manifold, and more recent results demonstrate that neural activity is further constrained by a neural repertoire within the intrinsic manifold ( Golub et al., 2018 ). However, a repertoire defines only a set of population activity patterns, and not how often different activity patterns within the repertoire are produced. Therefore, to understand the principles governing the selection among redundant population activity patterns, we focused on predicting the distribution of redundant population activity within the intrinsic manifold and neural repertoire. We found strong evidence for the third hypothesis, that redundant activity is coupled with task-relevant activity. This indicates that neural redundancy is resolved differently than muscular redundancy. Furthermore, the output-null space should not be thought of as a space in which neural activity can freely vary to carry out computations without regard to the output-potent activity. Instead, the distribution of output-null activity is constrained by the corresponding output-potent activity. If the required output-potent activity is defined by the task demands, this can constrain how the output-null activity can vary, and correspondingly the computations that can be carried out in the output-null space.

For this to happen, millions of neurons in your brain and spinal cord must fire to make those muscles contract. If you swing the racket a second time, the same muscles in your arm will contract again. But the firing pattern of the underlying neurons will probably be different. This phenomenon, in which different patterns of neural activity generate the same outcome, is called neural redundancy. Neural redundancy allows a set of neurons to perform multiple tasks at once. For example, the same neurons may drive an arm movement while simultaneously planning the next activity. But does performing a given task constrain how often different patterns of neural activity can be produced ? If so, this would limit whether other tasks could be carried out at the same time. To address this, Hennig et al. trained macaque monkeys to use a brain-computer interface ( BCI ). This is a device that reads out electrical brain activity and converts it into signals that can be used to control another device. The key advantage of a BCI is that the redundant activity patterns are precisely known. The monkeys learned to use their brain activity, via the BCI, to move a cursor on a computer screen in different directions. The results revealed that monkeys could only produce a limited number of different patterns of brain activity for a given BCI cursor movement. This suggests that the ability of a group of neurons to multitask is restricted. For example, if the same set of neurons is involved in both planning and performing movements, then an animal\u2019s ability to plan a future movement will depend on the one it is currently performing. BCIs can help patients who have suffered stroke or paralysis. They enable patients to use their brain activity to control a computer or even robotic limbs. Understanding how the brain controls BCIs will help us improve their performance and deepen our knowledge of how the brain plans and performs movements. This might include designing BCIs that allow users to multitask more effectively ."}

A surprising paradox emerging from recent studies is that ubiquitin ligases ( E3s ) and deubiquitinases ( DUBs ), enzymes with opposing activities, can both promote ERAD. Here we demonstrate that the ERAD E3 gp78 can ubiquitinate not only ERAD substrates, but also the machinery protein Ubl4A, a key component of the Bag6 chaperone complex. Remarkably, instead of targeting Ubl4A for degradation, polyubiquitination is associated with irreversible proteolytic processing and inactivation of Bag6. Importantly, we identify USP13 as a gp78-associated DUB that eliminates ubiquitin conjugates from Ubl4A to maintain the functionality of Bag6. Our study reveals an unexpected paradigm in which a DUB prevents undesired ubiquitination to sharpen substrate specificity for an associated ubiquitin ligase partner and to promote ER quality control.  In eukaryotic cells, secretory and membrane proteins are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ). In this protein maturation process, nascent polypeptides need to pass stringent checkpoints monitored by a sophisticated quality control program. Only correctly folded proteins can exit the ER and reach their final destinations, whereas terminally misfolded or unassembled polypeptides are retained and eliminated by the ER-associated degradation ( ERAD ) system ( Vembar and Brodsky, 2008; Smith et al., 2011 ). This mechanism not only adapts cells to proteotoxic stress ( Balch et al., 2008 ), but also fine-tunes signaling processes essential for the development of multicellular organisms ( Ron and Walter, 2007 ). ERAD requires retrotranslocation of misfolded polypeptides across the membrane for ubiquitination by one of a few ER-associated ubiquitin conjugating systems, each comprising a ubiquitin ligase ( E3 ) and a cognate conjugating enzyme ( E2 ) ( Hirsch et al., 2009; Ye and Rape, 2009 ). Ubiquitin ligases are a key component of the cellular ubiquitination machinery that acts at the final step of ubiquitin transfer to ensure only certain substrates are selectively ubiquitinated in both temporally and spatially regulated manners ( Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009 ). Substrate specificities of E3s are thought to be an intrinsic property of these enzymes, but whether it can be modulated by additional factors is an open question. In ERAD, substrate ubiquitination occurs on the cytosolic side of the ER membranes, immediately after substrates have emerged from the ER lumen. This modification serves as a signal to recruit the p97/VCP ATPase, leading to the extraction of substrates from the ER membrane ( Bays et al., 2001; Ye et al., 2001; Jarosch et al., 2002; Flierman et al., 2003 ). Additionally, it facilitates subsequent targeting of retrotranslocated substrates to the proteasome ( Vembar and Brodsky, 2008 ). In mammalian cells, the multi-spanning membrane protein gp78 is one of the most extensively studied E3s in ERAD ( Fang et al., 2001; Song et al., 2005; Jo et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012 ). gp78 is homologous to Hrd1p, an ERAD-specific E3 in yeast proposed to form a \u2018retrotranslocon\u2019 that channels misfolded proteins out of the ER ( Carvalho et al., 2010 ). Similar to Hrd1p, gp78 also forms a large membrane complex that communicates with machinery proteins on both sides of the membrane ( Zhong et al., 2004; Christianson et al., 2011 ), establishing it as a master regulator of retrotranslocation. On the luminal side, ER chaperones and lectins recognize and deliver misfolded proteins to a gp78-containing complex for retrotranslocation. In the cytosol, gp78 uses a VIM ( VCP-interacting motif ) segment to bind p97/VCP ( Ballar et al., 2006 ). In addition, it has a CUE ( coupling ubiquitin to ER degradation ) domain that recruits a multiprotein complex comprising Bag6 and its cofactors Ubl4A and Trc35 ( Chen et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011 ). Bag6 contains an unusual chaperone \u2018holdase\u2019 activity, capable of maintaining retrotranslocated polypeptides in a soluble state to enhance their turnover ( Wang et al., 2011 ). Moreover, Bag6 was reported to interact transiently with the proteasome ( Minami et al., 2010 ), raising the possibility that it may facilitate substrate hand over from the gp78\u2013p97 complex to the proteasome. Importantly, this \u2018holdase\u2019 activity can also act in conjunction with other ubiquitin ligases to help degrade defective cytosolic and mislocalized proteins ( Minami et al., 2010; Hessa et al., 2011 ), establishing Bag6 as a major E3-associated chaperone in protein quality control ( Lee and Ye, 2013 ). In addition to ubiquitin ligases and associated factors, recent studies have implicated deubiquitinases ( DUBs ), enzymes that cleave ubiquitin conjugates, as important regulators of ERAD. However, unlike ubiquitin ligases, the functions of DUBs in ERAD are obscure. Many DUBs involved in ERAD associate with p97/VCP either directly or indirectly. These include YOD1 ( Ernst et al., 2009 ), ataxin-3 ( Wang et al., 2006; Zhong and Pittman, 2006 ), USP25 ( Blount et al., 2012 ), USP13, USP50, and VCPIP1 ( Sowa et al., 2009 ). Interestingly, although deubiquitination has often been reported to cause removal of the proteasome targeting signals and therefore inhibition of protein turnover, many p97-associated DUBs apparently serve as positive regulators in ERAD ( Wang et al., 2006; Ernst et al., 2009; Sowa et al., 2009 ). Several models have been proposed to explain these surprising findings, but experimental data in support of any of these models are lacking ( Liu and Ye, 2012 ). In this study, we characterize a p97-associated deubiquitinase termed USP13. Our study reveals an unexpected interaction between USP13 and the ERAD-specific ubiquitin ligase gp78. Despite having opposing activities, USP13 can cooperate with gp78 to promote ERAD. Mechanistically, USP13 plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the substrate specificity of gp78 as in its absence ubiquitin chains assembled by gp78 can accumulate on an ERAD machinery component\u2014the Bag6-Ubl4A-Trc35 complex that is associated with proteolytic processing of Bag6 and altered interaction between Bag6 and SGTA. Together, these results established that the activity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase can be safeguarded by an accompanying deubiquitinase to enhance its specificity.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells make proteins inside a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. However, some of these proteins cannot fold into the correct shape, so cells rely on a process called the ERAD pathway to degrade and eliminate these faulty proteins. First, however, the misfolded proteins must be moved from the endoplasmic reticulum to the main body of the cell ( the cytosol ). The process by which the misfolded proteins are moved through the membrane that encloses the endoplasmic reticulum is complex, with \u2018ERAD machinery proteins\u2019 playing an important role. Among them, a series of enzymes called E3 ligases \u2018tag\u2019 the faulty proteins with a small protein called ubiquitin, and a complex called the proteasome then recognizes and degrades those proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin. However, it is not clear why the E3 ligases that tag the misfolded proteins with ubiquitin don\u2019t also tag the machinery proteins that from complexes with the faulty proteins. Now Liu et al. have used a combination of biochemical and genetic tools to shed light on this puzzle by studying the interaction of gp78\u2014which is an E3 ligase\u2014and USP13, an enzyme that opposes the actions of the E3 ligases by removing ubiquitin. Liu et al. showed that gp78 can indeed tag certain machinery proteins with ubiquitin, which would stop the removal of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. However, USP13 opposed the action of gp78, thus allowing the removal to continue. It has been known for some time that enzymes with opposing roles\u2014the addition and removal of ubiquitin\u2014can work together, but the biological significance of this phenomenon was not fully understood. The work of Liu et al. suggests that USP13 makes the elimination of misfolded proteins more efficient by ensuring that gp78 only tags those proteins that are misfolded: it does this by removing ubiquitin from proteins that should not have been tagged. A similar phenomenon is known to occur in genetics during DNA replication, with the enzyme complex that replicates the DNA including an enzyme that performs a proofreading role ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe hologenome concept proposes that microbes and their host organism are an independent unit of selection. Motivated by this concept, we hypothesized that thermal acclimation in poikilothermic organisms, owing to their inability to maintain their body temperature, is connected to their microbiome composition. To test this hypothesis, we used a unique experimental setup with a transgenerational selective breeding scheme for cold tolerance in tropical tilapias. We tested the effects of the selection on the gut microbiome and on host transcriptomic response. Interestingly, we found that host genetic selection for thermal tolerance shapes the microbiome composition and its response to cold. The microbiomes of cold-resistant fish showed higher resilience to temperature changes, indicating that the microbiome is shaped by its host's selection. These findings are consistent with the hologenome concept and highlight the connection between the host and its microbiome's response to the environment.  Cold temperature is an environmental challenge that greatly affects metabolic and physiological processes. Thus, adaptations to temperature fluctuations are expected to be found across all organisms. When exposed to cold temperatures, animals undergo remarkable physiological adjustments in\u00a0order\u00a0to maintain homeostasis. Such adjustments may occur through genetic and/or non-genetic mechanisms that increase their fitness. Recent work in mice revealed that the gut microbiome facilitates key adaptations during cold exposure by promoting energy demand-driven regulation ( Chevalier et al., 2015; Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2018 ). This is not surprising, as many studies have already proven the vital importance of gut microbial communities for host survival, homeostasis, development and functioning ( McFall-Ngai et al., 2013; Shabat et al., 2016 ). In fact, the universality of host\u2013microbe associations, either transient or tight, inspired the hologenome concept ( Bordenstein and Theis, 2015; Brucker and Bordenstein, 2013; Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2013; Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2016; Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2018; Theis et al., 2016 ), which proposes that within the holobiont, units at different levels, such as genes, chromosomes or biont combinations ( i. e., host and microbes ), are subject to selection or neutrality. Within this concept, host\u2013microbe interactions have an important role in the host's physiology, whilst microbiome composition may be affected by host selection. Taking this into account, we hypothesized that host selection may facilitate changes in the host-associated microbial species and in\u00a0their response to environmental selection pressure. Poikilothermic organisms, such as fish, must develop strategies to maintain homeostasis within diverse temperature gradients\u00a0because\u00a0environmental temperature changes would\u00a0otherwise\u00a0disrupt homeostasis and cause deleterious effects on vital physiological functions ( Guschina and Harwood, 2006; Vinagre et al., 2012 ). The physiological response to stress may vary among populations or individuals and can be affected by various factors ( Nitzan et al., 2016; Somero, 2010 ). Microbial communities in aquatic environments have also been reported to be affected by abiotic factors\u00a0that\u00a0act as a habitat-filtering force, such as temperature ( Fuhrman et al., 2008 ). In poikilothermic organisms, the gut microbiome experiences temperature fluctuations that do not exist in homeotherms. There is evidence of a temperature effect on the microbial dynamics associated with invertebrate species ( Beleneva and Zhukova, 2009; Carlos et al., 2013; Erwin et al., 2012; Lokmer and Mathias Wegner, 2015; Mahalaxmi et al., 2013; Preheim et al., 2011; Zurel et al., 2011 ), but such information is largely missing for aquatic poikilothermic vertebrates. Taking the hologenome concept into account, we asked whether host transgenerational selection for thermal tolerance, which is instrumental to poikilothermic organisms\u2019 fitness, involves the host\u2013gut microbiome axis. More specifically, how does microbiome composition respond to temperature changes and does host tolerance shape this response ? Here, we hypothesized that\u00a0the thermal tolerance of poikilothermic vertebrates affects their associated gut microbial species, as well as the response of these microbes to temperature alterations. We focused specifically on the association of changes in the microbiome with the transgenerational low-temperature response in tropical fish, such as tilapia species. The growth of these\u00a0fish species is highly affected by temperature; they are subject to growth inhibition and mortality when exposed to low temperatures ( Cnaani et al., 2000 ). However, recent work revealed transgenerational inheritance of cold tolerance in these species ( Nitzan et al., 2016 ). Therefore, we used a unique setup, composed of 66 fish\u00a0families that are part of a transgenerational selective-breeding scheme for enhanced cold tolerance ( Figure 1 ). In this setup, we chose fish progeny from families with the most extreme phenotypes, selected on the basis of the survival rate of their siblings at low temperatures and characterized as cold-resistant or cold-sensitive. Hence, these fish progenies had never experienced low temperature exposure before they were challenged. We used this setup to understand how selection on host thermal tolerance corresponds to microbiome shifts. Our results suggest that host selection for cold tolerance is followed by changes in the gut microbiome, which are manifested by higher resilience to temperature shifts and which\u00a0may be a key factor in\u00a0orchestrating cold acclimation in poikilothermic animals.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Animals and plants host diverse microbial communities that are vital for their survival. In fact, the host organisms and their associated \u2018microbiome\u2019 are so closely linked that they are often described as a single entity: the holobiont unit. This suggests that when the host adapts to cope with stressful conditions, similar changes should also occur in its microbiome. Fish are unable to maintain a stable body temperature and can be greatly affected by temperature fluctuations. Some fish are better able to tolerate cold conditions than others, but it was not known if their gut microbes are similarly affected by changes in temperature. To investigate, Kokou et al. selectively bred tropical blue tilapia to create families of fish that could either tolerate the cold well, or that were highly sensitive to the cold. The gut microbiomes of cold-resistant fish were different from the cold-sensitive ones, even though the fish lived in the same tank. Moreover, the gut microbiomes of the cold-tolerant fish showed higher resilience to temperature changes than the microbes in the guts of the cold-sensitive fish. It remains to be determined whether the response of the microbiome directly affects how its host fish responds to temperature changes. However, the results presented by Kokou et al. show that there are links between how the host and its microbes adapt to environmental stress. As well as helping us to understand how holobionts evolved, this knowledge could also potentially be applied broadly in clinical sciences or agriculture, for example to select for efficient crops ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe correct distribution and activity of secreted signaling proteins called morphogens is required for many developmental processes. Nodal morphogens play critical roles in embryonic axis formation in many organisms. Models proposed to generate the Nodal gradient include diffusivity, ligand processing, and a temporal activation window. But how the Nodal morphogen gradient forms in vivo remains unclear. Here, we have measured in vivo for the first time, the binding affinity of Nodal ligands to their major cell surface receptor, Acvr2b, and to the Nodal inhibitor, Lefty, by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. We examined the diffusion coefficient of Nodal ligands and Lefty inhibitors in live zebrafish embryos by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We also investigated the contribution of ligand degradation to the Nodal gradient. We show that ligand clearance via degradation shapes the Nodal gradient and correlates with its signaling range. By computational simulations of gradient formation, we demonstrate that diffusivity, extra-cellular interactions, and selective ligand destruction collectively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient.  In many animals, development from a single cell to a complex multicellular organism requires the graded distribution and activity of diffusible proteins, which are known as morphogens. How morphogen gradients are formed is not fully understood. Studies in many organisms have suggested three major mechanisms to establish morphogen gradients: 1 ) diffusion, 2 ) transcytosis and 3 ) via cytonemes ( Green, 2002; M\u00fcller et al., 2013; Rogers and Schier, 2011; Wartlick et al., 2009 ). For example, the gradient of fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) is established by diffusion and is regulated by extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) ( Dowd et al., 1999; Duchesne et al., 2012; Makarenkova et al., 2009; Miura et al., 2009; Nowak et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2009 ), whereas the gradient of Drosophila Decapentaplegic ( Dpp ) is established not only by diffusion, but also via transcytosis ( Dierick and Bejsovec, 1998; Kruse et al., 2004 ) and cytonemes ( Hsiung et al., 2005; Ramirez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999; Roy et al., 2011 ). Nodal proteins, which belong to the TGF-\u03b2 family of signaling proteins, play critical roles in vertebrate development ( Arnold and Robertson, 2009; Wakefield and Hill, 2013 ). They serve as mesendoderm inducers in vertebrates, and are involved in many aspects of embryonic axis formation during development ( Kumari et al., 2013; Sampath and Robertson, 2016 ). Nodal proteins are translated as precursors and function as dimers ( Massagu\u00e9, 1990 ). The Nodal precursors are cleaved by extracellular convertases, and convertase processing was found to be essential for Nodal activation in zebrafish and mouse embryonic tissues ( Beck et al., 2002; Le Good et al., 2005 ). A recent report found that FurinA convertase activity regulates long range signaling by the zebrafish left-right patterning Nodal, Southpaw ( Spaw ), but not other Nodal factors ( Tessadori et al., 2015 ). Upon activation, Nodal proteins form complexes with type II and type I Activin receptors ( Acvr1b; Acvr2a/b ), which are serine/threonine kinases ( Reissmann et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2002; Yeo and Whitman, 2001 ) and activate the Nodal pathway ( Jia et al., 2008; Kumar, 2000; Massagu\u00e9 et al., 2005; Whitman, 1998 ). Nodal target genes include nodal itself and lefty, which encodes a feedback inhibitor of Nodal signaling ( Branford and Yost, 2002; Meno et al., 1999 ). In zebrafish, of the three nodal homologs, cyclops ( cyc ), squint ( sqt ) and southpaw ( spaw ), sqt and cyc are expressed in an overlapping pattern in the gastrula margin where presumptive mesoderm and endoderm cells are located ( Erter et al., 1998; Feldman et al., 1998; Gritsman et al., 2000; Long et al., 2003; Rebagliati et al., 1998a; 1998b; Sampath et al., 1998;\u00a0van Boxtel et al., 2015 ). However, Sqt and Cyc elicit differential responses in target cells: Sqt acts at long-range whereas Cyc only affects cells immediately adjacent to the source of the signal ( Chen and Schier, 2001; Jing et al., 2006; M\u00fcller et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2008 ). So far, there is no evidence for a requirement for transcytosis and cytonemes in distributing the Nodal factors and the Nodal morphogen gradient has been proposed to be established by simple diffusion ( Williams et al., 2004 ). The diffusion coefficient of a molecule is a measure of its ability to move freely across a defined region. The free diffusion coefficient of the zebrafish Nodals has been suggested to be faster than their effective diffusion coefficient ( M\u00fcller et al., 2012; 2013 ), resulting in fast diffusion over short distances but slow diffusion over longer distances presumably by morphogen trapping at high affinity binding sites. These observations led to the hypothesis that Nodal diffusion is hindered either by cell surface interactions or by molecules in the extracellular matrix ( M\u00fcller et al., 2013 ). How Nodal diffusion is hindered, and to what extent it shapes the Nodal gradient is unclear. In contrast to the differential diffusion model, a recent study suggested that a temporal signal activation window created by microRNA-430 ( miRNA-430 ) delays translation of the Nodal antagonist Lefty to determine the dimensions of Nodal signaling in the gastrula ( van Boxtel et al., 2015 ). Repression by miRNA-430 likely plays a key role in regulation of Nodal signaling. However, miRNA-430 is not exclusive to lefty1 but also targets nodal/sqt ( Choi et al., 2007 ). Moreover, reporter\u00a0protein expression and ribosome-profiling data from zebrafish embryos indicate that Nodal/Sqt and Lefty1 are translated in a similar temporal window in the early gastrula ( Choi et al., 2007;\u00a0Bazzini et al., 2012; Chew et al., 2013 ). As such, it is unclear how the proposed temporal activation window might be converted into a spatial Nodal gradient. Some studies have suggested that in addition to diffusion, the gradient of a morphogen is related to the rate of ligand clearance or stability ( Callejo et al., 2006; Chamberlain et al., 2008; Gregor et al., 2007; Kicheva et al., 2007; Wartlick et al., 2009 ), and a role for stability and clearance of Nodals in vivo\u00a0has been proposed ( Jing et al., 2006; Le Good et al., 2005; Tian and Meng, 2006 ). Previously, we reported an atypical lysosome-targeting region located in the pro-domain of Cyc, which targets this Nodal protein for destruction, and regulates target gene induction ( Tian et al., 2008 ). How the lysosome-targeting region regulates Nodal clearance and how it influences the Nodal morphogen gradient was not known. In this study, we have examined the diffusion coefficient of Nodals in live zebrafish embryos by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ). FCS is a widely used single molecule sensitive technique that can quantitatively measure diffusion and concentrations in vivo by determining how fast particles diffuse through a fixed observation volume ( Shi et al., 2009c; Yu et al., 2009 ). We estimated the affinity of Nodals to the type II receptor Acvr2b on the cell surface and to Lefty inhibitors in the extracellular space by single wavelength fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy ( SW-FCCS ). SW-FCCS uses a single laser to excite proteins labeled with spectrally different fluorophores within the observation volume ( e. g., the confocal volume ) ( Shi et al., 2009a ). By analyzing the correlated movement of various labeled proteins ( ligands/receptor/inhibitor ), we determined the fraction of the proteins that were free or bound, and calculated the dissociation constants in live zebrafish embryos. We also investigated the contribution of ligand stability in forming the Nodal gradient. By analyzing diffusion and binding in vivo\u00a0and from computational simulations, we show that diffusivity alone is insufficient to generate the Nodal morphogen gradient. Our findings show that in order to generate and maintain a robust Nodal morphogen gradient, ligand clearance by degradation is balanced against the binding and release of Nodal ligands with the receptor and inhibitors.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Animals develop from a single fertilized egg cell into multicellular organisms. This process requires chemical signals called \u201cmorphogens\u201d that instruct the cells how to behave during development. The morphogens move across cells and tissues to form gradients of the signal. Cells then respond in different ways depending on how much of the signal they receive. This, in turn, depends on several factors: first, how quickly or slowly the signal moves; second, how well the morphogen binds to responding cells and other molecules in its path; and third, how much signal is lost or destroyed during the movement. Many researchers study morphogen gradients in the transparent zebrafish, since it grows quickly and it is easy to see developmental changes. However, until now it was not fully clear how the well-known morphogen called Nodal moves in live zebrafish as they develop. Wang, Wang et al. have now investigated how well Nodal signals bind to the surface of cells that receive the signal and to a molecule called \u201cLefty\u201d, which is present in the same path and interferes with Nodal signals. Advanced techniques called fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectroscopy were used to measure Nodal signals at the level of single molecules in growing zebrafish. The experiments gave insights into how far Nodal signals move and remain active. The results showed that, in addition to Nodal diffusing and binding to receiving cells, one of the most important factors determining how far and quickly Nodal moves is its inactivation and destruction. Lastly, Wang, Wang et al. built computational models to test their observations from live zebrafish. The current work was based on forcing zebrafish to produce molecules including Nodal at locations within the fish that normally do not make them. Therefore future experiments will aim to examine these molecules and their interactions when they are produced at their normal locations in the animal over time ."}

Plasmalemma clathrin-coated structures range from unitary domed assemblies to expansive planar constructions with internal or flanking invaginated buds. Precisely how these morphologically-distinct coats are formed, and whether all are functionally equivalent for selective cargo internalization is still disputed. We have disrupted the genes encoding a set of early arriving clathrin-coat constituents, FCHO1 and FCHO2, in HeLa cells. Endocytic coats do not disappear in this genetic background; rather clustered planar lattices predominate and endocytosis slows, but does not cease. The central linker of FCHO proteins acts as an allosteric regulator of the prime endocytic adaptor, AP-2. By loading AP-2 onto the plasma membrane, FCHO proteins provide a parallel pathway for AP-2 activation and clathrin-coat fabrication. Further, the steady-state morphology of clathrin-coated structures appears to be a manifestation of the availability of the muniscin linker during lattice polymerization.  The precise purpose of clathrin-coated vesicles was correctly deduced 50 years ago from thin-section electron micrographs ( Roth and Porter, 1964 ). Noticing the very close apposition of a compacted lumenal protein load and a cytosol-oriented \u2018bristle\u2019 coat on opposite faces of striking membrane invaginations, it was astutely reasoned that the bulbous plasmalemma structures ferry macromolecules into the cell interior in a highly selective manner. While it was soon clear clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a rapid activity ( Brown and Goldstein, 1976 ), and is importantly involved in many fundamental cellular processes ( McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Brodsky, 2012; Kirchhausen et al., 2014 ), the regularity of the static coated structures in micrograph views masks the true underlying molecular dynamics and complexity. It is also challenging to identify the very earliest stages of clathrin coat assembly in thin sections because of the restricted size, ill-defined morphological features, and a lack of prominent membrane curvature. With the recent live-cell clarification of the linked temporal steps that define clathrin-coated structure initiation, growth, invagination and scission ( Kaksonen et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2011 ), it is clear that a large number of gene products are involved. The choreographed arrival and departure of these numerous proteins matches well their defined biochemical activities and the morphological progression of the bud ( Taylor et al., 2011 ). Yet, what exactly defines a restricted plasma membrane zone that is destined to become a clathrin-coated bud remains elusive. In this regard, the clathrin coats at the cell surface are distinct from many other intracellular cargo sorting coats in that the selected assembly site is not demarcated by deposition of a GTP-bound small GTPase ( Ren et al., 2013 ). The lipid phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4, 5 ) P2 ) is required for clathrin assembly ( Boucrot et al., 2006; Zoncu et al., 2007; Nunez et al., 2011 ), but this phosphoinositide is broadly distributed over the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Ordered polymerization of a clathrin patch in fact appears to be a variable and probabilistic process ( Ehrlich et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2011; Cocucci et al., 2012; Brach et al., 2014 ). The nucleation stage displays the widest temporal variation and likely involves the largest number of protein cofactors ( Taylor et al., 2011 ). While the principal heterotetameric cargo-selective adaptor, designated AP-2, is certainly important ( Mitsunari et al., 2005; Cocucci et al., 2012; Aguet et al., 2013 ), its initial occurrence at inchoate bud sites is paralleled by a sizable suite of early-arriving pioneers, including eps15, intersectin, epsin, Fcho1 and Fcho2, CALM ( Taylor et al., 2011 ) and Necap 1 ( Ritter et al., 2013 ). The Fcho family ( Fer/Cip4 homology only proteins ), collectively termed the muniscins ( Reider et al., 2009 ), is posited to act as internalization site founders on the basis of the biochemical properties of the proteins and the endocytic consequences of RNAi-mediated transcript silencing ( Henne et al., 2010 ). Here we show that munsicins are indeed consequential endocytic pioneers, but that clathrin-mediated endocytosis still persists in their absence ( Uezu et al., 2011; Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012; Mayers et al., 2013; Brach et al., 2014 ). We delineate a key biochemical aspect of the early operation of these endocytic proteins that regulates the rate and extent of clathrin-lattice fabrication at the cell surface.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells can take proteins and other molecules that are either embedded in, or attached to, their surface membrane and move them inside via a process called endocytosis. This process often involves a protein called clathrin working together with numerous other proteins. Early on, a complex of four proteins, called the adaptor protein-2 complex, interacts with both the \u2018cargo\u2019 molecules that are to be taken into the cell, and the cell membrane. Clathrin molecules then assemble into an ordered lattice-like coat, on top of the adaptor protein complex layer. This deforms a small patch of the cell membrane and curves it inwards. The clathrin molecules coat this pocket as it grows in size, until it engulfs the cargo. The pocket quickly pinches off from the membrane to form a bubble-like structure called a vesicle, which is brought into the cell. A family of proteins termed Muniscins were thought to be involved in the early stages of endocytosis and have to arrive at the membrane before the adaptor protein-2 complex and clathrin. But experiments to test this idea\u2014that reduced, or \u2018knocked-down\u2019, the production of Muniscins\u2014had given conflicting results. As such, it remained unclear how the small patches of membrane carrying cargo molecules are marked as being destined to become clathrin-coated vesicles. Now Umasankar et al. have studied the role that these proteins play in the early stages of endocytosis in human cells grown in a laboratory. A gene-editing approach was used to precisely disrupt a gene that codes for a Muniscin protein called FCHO2. Umasankar et al. observed that these \u2018edited\u2019 cells formed clathrin coats that were more irregular compared with those that form in normal cells. Nevertheless, clathrin-mediated vesicles still formed when this protein was absent, though the process of endocytosis was slower. Similar results were seen when Umasankar et al. used the same approach to disrupt the gene for a related protein called FCHO1 in the same cells. A short fragment of the Muniscin proteins, called the linker, was shown to bind to, and activate, the adaptor protein-2 complex. The linker then recruits this complex to the specific regions of the cell membrane where clathrin-coated vesicles will form. Several dozen other proteins also accumulate where clathrin pockets form; as such, one of the next challenges will be to investigate if this mechanism of locally activating the cargo-gathering machinery is common in living cells ."}

We used multiplex tandem mass tag ( TMT ) -based whole cell proteomics to perform a comprehensive time course analysis of >6500 viral and cellular proteins during HIV infection. To enable specific functional predictions, we categorized cellular proteins regulated by HIV according to their patterns of temporal expression. We focussed on proteins depleted with similar kinetics to APOBEC3C, and found the viral accessory protein Vif to be necessary and sufficient for CUL5-dependent proteasomal degradation of all members of the B56 family of regulatory subunits of the key cellular phosphatase PP2A ( PPP2R5A-E ). Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of HIV-infected cells confirmed Vif-dependent hyperphosphorylation of >200 cellular proteins, particularly substrates of the aurora kinases. The ability of Vif to target PPP2R5 subunits is found in primate and non-primate lentiviral lineages, and remodeling of the cellular phosphoproteome is therefore a second ancient and conserved Vif function.  Viruses hijack host proteins and processes to optimize the cellular environment for viral replication and/or persistence. Manipulation by viruses signposts critical pathways in viral pathogenesis and cell biology, and evolutionary pressure has led to conflict between cellular restriction factors ( limiting viral replication ) and viral countermeasures ( overcoming restriction in vivo ). We previously used multiplex whole cell proteomic analysis of Human Cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) -infected fibroblasts to define expression time courses of viral and cellular proteins and identify novel proteins involved in the host-HCMV interaction, a technique we termed Quantitative Temporal Viromics ( QTV ) ( Weekes et al., 2014 ). Here, we provide a comprehensive temporal proteomic analysis of HIV infection. The HIV-1 'accessory proteins' Vif, Vpr, Nef and Vpu share a common ability to target cellular proteins for degradation ( Simon et al., 2015; Sugden et al., 2016 ). Whilst dispensible for viral replication in vitro, they are essential for pathogenesis in vivo. Nef and Vpu are multifunctional adaptors which co-opt endolysosomal and proteasomal machinery to downregulate numerous plasma membrane proteins, including their canonical substrates CD4, tetherin and MHC class I. In contrast, although Vif and Vpr are known to target cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins for proteasomal degradation, relatively few cellular substrates have been reported. The only known Vif targets are members of the APOBEC family of cytosine deaminases, which are otherwise incorporated into viral particles and act as dominant restriction factors causing hyper-mutation of the HIV genome ( Desimmie et al., 2014; Malim, 2009 ). Whilst Nef, Vpr and Vpu are found exclusively in primate lentiviruses, Vif is found in four of the five extant lentiviral lineages, infecting primate, feline, bovine and small ruminant hosts ( Gifford, 2012 ), and the ability to target cognate host APOBEC proteins is conserved across Vif variants from all these diverse lineages ( Larue et al., 2010 ). Cellular proteins regulated by HIV have generally been identified using non-systematic, candidate approaches. We recently used a different, unbiased plasma membrane proteomic approach to reveal\u00a0>100 previously unsuspected cell surface proteins depleted by HIV-1, including novel Nef ( SERINC3/5 ) and Vpu ( SNAT1 ) targets ( Matheson et al., 2015 ). Whole cell proteomic studies of HIV-infected cells have been variably hampered by limited proteome coverage, asynchronous infections and confounding by the presence of bystander ( uninfected ) cells ( Supplementary file 1 ). Consequently, it has been difficult to attribute changes in protein levels to expression of specific viral genes, and intracellular proteins targeted by HIV accessory proteins have not been discovered in this fashion. In this study, we extend our tandem mass tag ( TMT ) -based temporal proteomic approach to describe global changes in HIV-infected T cells, comprising expression time courses of\u00a0>6500 proteins. We cluster proteins according to their patterns of temporal expression, and identify\u00a0>100 cellular proteins regulated by HIV, including candidate resistance/restriction factors and HIV accessory protein targets. To test the utility of our approach, we focus on proteins depleted with similar kinetics to APOBEC3C, and confirm the B56 family of regulatory subunits of the key cellular phosphatase PP2A ( PPP2R5A-E ) to be novel Vif targets. We use large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics to demonstrate Vif-dependent remodelling of the cellular phosphoproteome during HIV infection, and show that, along with APOBEC proteins, antagonism of PP2A-B56 is an ancient and conserved Vif function.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: About 100 years since it was first transmitted to humans, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infects almost 40 million people worldwide and causes more than a million AIDS-related deaths every year. It is therefore critical to understand how HIV has been able to multiply and spread, and why infection with HIV causes AIDS. In the evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d between viruses like HIV and the cells they infect, viruses try to enhance their ability to multiply, and cells try to resist. These interactions emphasise the processes that are most important for cells and viruses, and suggest new ways to treat HIV and other viral infections. Proteomics is the large-scale study of molecules known as proteins, the critical building blocks of both cells and viruses. Greenwood, Matheson et al. use proteomics to measure how the abundance of proteins in human cells change during HIV infection, and identify new interactions between the virus and its host. The experiments distinguish more than 6500 proteins, and reveal that an HIV protein called Vif destroys several key components of a cellular protein called PP2A. Previous studies have demonstrated that PP2A plays a critical role in regulating the activities of numerous other proteins and processes in cells. Greenwood, Matheson et al. further show that other HIV-related viruses that infect monkeys, apes and even sheep can also counteract PP2A, suggesting that this interaction has been important during host and virus evolution. The next steps following on from this work are to find out why HIV attacks PP2A, and whether drugs that interfere with this interaction may help to treat HIV infection. A future challenge will be to investigate how HIV interacts with other cellular proteins highlighted by the proteomics approach ."}

However, less is known about how their interplay might influence behavior and physiology. Here we focused on social hierarchy status, a major component of the social environment in mice, and whether it influences behavioral adaptation to chronic stress in a sex-specific manner. We used a high-throughput automated behavioral monitoring system to assess social dominance in same-sex, group-living mice. We found that position in the social hierarchy at baseline was a significant predictor of multiple behavioral outcomes following exposure to chronic stress. Crucially, this association carried opposite consequences for the two sexes. This work demonstrates the importance of recognizing the interplay between sex and social factors and enhances our understating of how individual differences shape the stress response.  Stress-related psychopathologies, such as mood and anxiety disorders, show a pronounced gender bias in their prevalence, severity, age-of-onset, and most common comorbidities ( Altemus et al., 2014; Bangasser and Valentino, 2014; Kessler et al., 2005; Young and Pfaff, 2014 ). For example, the latest studies estimate the prevalence of major depressive disorder among women as 1. 5 times higher than in men ( World Health Organization, 2017 ). In addition, in women major depression is characterized by increased symptom severity ( Martin et al., 2013 ) and is more commonly comorbid with anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and sleep disturbances, while men with major depression are more prone to develop aggression, alcohol or substance abuse, and suicidal ideation ( Marcus et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2013 ). Despite these observations and the documented\u00a0examples\u00a0of sexual dimorphism in human\u00a0stress response ( Bangasser and Valentino, 2012 ), the biological mechanisms that give rise to sex differences in stress response are not well understood ( Beery and Zucker, 2011; Joel and McCarthy, 2017 ). The symptomatology of stress-related pathologies and the biological response to stress span several domains of functioning including energy metabolism, mood, and sociability. Recent studies in rodent models of stress-related psychopathologies have already identified several differences across molecular, behavioral, and metabolic levels ( Bangasser and Wicks, 2017; Brivio et al., 2020; Hodes, 2018; Hodes and Epperson, 2019; Young and Pfaff, 2014 ). Very few studies, however, have looked into the interaction between pre-existing differences in social behavior between the sexes and stress. Considering that abnormalities in social functioning are an essential part of the symptomatology of stress-related disorders, differences in social behavior and social cognition prior to disorder onset are likely to contribute to disorder susceptibility. Here, we explored how social context shapes the response to chronic stress. We focused specifically on social dominance, an essential characteristic of rodent social groups. Wild and laboratory rodents form complex and dynamic social structures which typically involve the formation of dominance hierarchies ( Kondrakiewicz et al., 2019 ). These have been observed in the lab in group sizes ranging from three to over a dozen individuals ( Horii et al., 2017; Varholick et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2014 ). Hierarchies are thought to improve social stability and reduce severe conflicts and aggression ( Curley, 2016 ). As a consequence, an individual\u2019s position in the dominance hierarchy has important consequences, including preferential access to food, shelter, and mates ( Drews, 1993 ). Social rank within male hierarchies is also known to influence health, hormonal profile, brain function, metabolism, and mortality ( Pall\u00e9 et al., 2019; Razzoli et al., 2018 ). For instance, subordinate individuals display increased anxiety-like behavior, a suppressed immune response, higher basal corticosterone levels, and reduced life span ( Bartolomucci, 2007 ). These types of relationships have classically been studied in male animals, as female mice have usually appeared more communal and displayed limited aggression ( K\u00f6nig and Lindholm, 2012 ). Recent work, however, has demonstrated that female laboratory mice also form hierarchies that appear quite similar to those seen in males, accompanied by some of the same dominance-related physiological markers, such as differences in corticosterone levels ( Schuhr, 1987; van den Berg et al., 2015; Varholick et al., 2019; Varholick et al., 2018; Williamson et al., 2019 ). Thus, we examined social dominance status as a putative mediator of sex differences in the response to adverse events. To do so, we took advantage of a high-throughput automated behavioral monitoring system ( the Social Box, SB ) to assess and better understand the hierarchies of groups of male or female mice ( Forkosh et al., 2019; Shemesh et al., 2013 ). We then exposed mice to a well-established chronic stress procedure, the chronic mild stress ( CMS ) paradigm, and evaluated its effects using a series of standard behavioral and physiological readouts. Finally, we used social dominance status at baseline to predict behavioral outcomes following CMS. We hypothesized that an individual\u2019s standing in the social hierarchy would be a predictor of behavior upon stress exposure, and that this relationship would differ between the sexes.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Most people experience chronic stress at some point in their life, which may increase their chances of developing depression or anxiety. There is evidence that chronic stress may more negatively impact the well-being of women, placing them as higher risk of developing these mental health conditions. The biological factors that underlie these differences are not well understood, which leaves clinicians and scientists struggling to develop and provide effective treatments. The social environment has a powerful influence on how people experience and cope with stress. For example, a person\u2019s social and socioeconomic status can change their perception of and reaction to everyday stress. Researchers have found differences in how men and women relate to their social standing. One way for scientists to learn more about the biological processes involved is to study the effect of social standing and chronic stress in male and female mice. Now, Karamihalev, Brivio et al. show that social status influences the behavior of stressed mice in a sex-specific way. In the experiments, an automated observation system documented the behavior of mice living in all female or male groups. Karamihalev, Brivio et al. determined where each animal fit into the social structure of their group. Then, they exposed some groups of mice to mild chronic stress and compared their behaviors to groups of mice housed in normal conditions. They found that both the sex and social status of each played a role in how they responded to stress. For example, subordinate males displayed more anxious behavior under stressful circumstances, while dominant females acted bolder and less anxious. More studies in mice are needed to understand the biological basis of these social- and sex-based differences in stress response. Learning more may help scientists understand why some individuals are more susceptible to the effects of stress and lead to the development of personalized prevention or treatment strategies for anxiety and depression ."}

Vaccination remains the most effective preventative. Rapid mutation of hemagglutinin allows viruses to escape adaptive immunity. This antigenic drift necessitates regular vaccine updates. Effective vaccine strains need to represent H3N2 populations circulating one year after strain selection. Experts select strains based on experimental measurements of antigenic drift and predictions made by models from hemagglutinin sequences. We developed a novel influenza forecasting framework that integrates phenotypic measures of antigenic drift and functional constraint with previously published sequence-only fitness estimates. Forecasts informed by phenotypic measures of antigenic drift consistently outperformed previous sequence-only estimates, while sequence-only estimates of functional constraint surpassed more comprehensive experimentally-informed estimates. Importantly, the best models integrated estimates of both functional constraint and either antigenic drift phenotypes or recent population growth.  Seasonal influenza virus infects 5\u201315% of the global population every year causing an estimated 250, 000 to 500, 000 deaths annually with the majority of infections caused by influenza A/H3N2 ( World Health Organization, 2014 ). Vaccination remains the most effective public health response available. However, frequent viral mutation results in viruses that escape previously acquired human immunity. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System ( GISRS ) monitors influenza evolution by sampling currently circulating viruses, or strains, and analyzing these strains with genome sequencing and serological assays. The WHO GISRS uses these data to select vaccine viruses that should best represent circulating viruses in the next influenza season. However, because the process of vaccine development and distribution requires several months to complete, optimal vaccine design requires an accurate prediction of which viruses will predominate approximately one year after vaccine viruses are selected. Historically, the effectiveness of the H3N2 vaccine component has been much lower than the other seasonal influenza subtypes. For example, H3N2\u2019s mean vaccine effectiveness from 2004 to 2015 was 33% compared to 61% for H1N1pdm and 54% for influenza B viruses ( Belongia et al., 2016 ). Multiple factors can reduce vaccine effectiveness including selection of a vaccine strain that is not antigenically representative of future populations ( Belongia et al., 2016; Gouma et al., 2020 ) and adaptations of the selected strain to egg-passaging during vaccine production that alter the antigenicity of the resulting vaccine component ( Zost et al., 2017 ). Even when vaccine strains are well-matched antigenically, they may fail to induce a strong immune response due to previous infection history of vaccine recipients ( Cobey et al., 2018 ). While all of these factors must be addressed to increase vaccine effectiveness, substantial effort has focused on the selection of the most representative strain for the next season\u2019s vaccine. Current vaccine predictions focus on the hemagglutinin ( HA ) protein, which acts as the primary target of human immunity. Until recently, the hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) assay has been the primary experimental measure of antigenic cross-reactivity between pairs of circulating viruses ( Hirst, 1943 ). Most modern H3N2 strains carry a glycosylation motif that reduces their binding efficiency in HI assays ( Chambers et al., 2015; Zost et al., 2017 ), prompting the increased use of virus neutralization assays including the neutralization-based focus reduction assay ( FRA ) ( Okuno et al., 1990 ). Together, these two assays are the gold standard in virus antigenic characterizations for vaccine strain selection, but they are laborious and low-throughput compared to genome sequencing ( Wood et al., 2012 ). As a result, researchers have developed computational methods to predict influenza evolution from sequence data alone ( Luksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014; Steinbr\u00fcck et al., 2014; Neher et al., 2014 ). Despite the promise of these sequence-only models, they explicitly omit experimental measurements of antigenic or functional phenotypes. Recent developments in computational methods and influenza virology have made it feasible to integrate these important metrics of influenza fitness into a single predictive model. For example, phenotypic measurements of antigenic drift are now accessible through phylogenetic models ( Neher et al., 2016 ) and functional phenotypes for HA are available from deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) experiments ( Lee et al., 2018 ). We describe an approach to integrate previously disparate sequence-only models of influenza evolution with high-quality experimental measurements of antigenic drift and functional constraint. The influenza community has long recognized the importance of incorporating HI phenotypes and other experimental measurements of viral phenotypes with existing forecasting methods to inform the vaccine design process ( Gandon et al., 2016; Morris et al., 2018; L\u00e4ssig et al., 2017 ). Although several distinct efforts have made progress in using HI phenotypes to evaluate the evolution of seasonal influenza ( Steinbr\u00fcck et al., 2014; Neher et al., 2016 ), published methods stop short of developing a complete forecasting framework wherein the evolutionary contribution of HI phenotypes can be compared and contrasted with new and existing fitness metrics. However, unpublished work by Luksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014 to the WHO GISRS network incorporates antigenic phenotypes into fitness-based predictions ( Morris et al., 2018; M \u0141uksza, personal communication, June 2020 ). Here, we provide an open source framework for forecasting the genetic composition of future seasonal influenza populations using genotypic and phenotypic fitness estimates. We apply this framework to HA sequence data shared via the GISAID EpiFlu database ( Shu and McCauley, 2017 ) and to HI and FRA titer data shared by WHO GISRS Collaborating Centers in London, Melbourne, Atlanta and Tokyo. We systematically compare potential predictors and show that HI phenotypes enable more accurate long-term forecasts of H3N2 populations compared to previous metrics based on epitope mutations alone. We also find that composite models based on phenotypic measures of antigenic drift and genotypic measures of functional constraint consistently outperform any fitness models based on individual genotypic or phenotypic metrics.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Vaccination is the best protection against seasonal flu. It teaches the immune system what the flu virus looks like, preparing it to fight off an infection. But the flu virus changes its molecular appearance every year, escaping the immune defences learnt the year before. So, every year, the vaccine needs updating. Since it takes almost a year to design and make a new flu vaccine, researchers need to be able to predict what flu viruses will look like in the future. Currently, this prediction relies on experiments that assess the molecular appearance of flu viruses, a complex and slow approach. One alternative is to examine the virus's genetic code. Mathematical models try to predict which genetic changes might alter the appearance of a flu virus, saving the cost of performing specialised experiments. Recent research has shown that these models can make good predictions, but including experimental measures of the virus\u2019 appearance could improve them even further. This could help the model to work out which genetic changes are likely to be beneficial to the virus, and which are not. To find out whether experimental data improves model predictions, Huddleston et al. designed a new forecasting tool which used 25 years of historical data from past flu seasons. Each forecast predicted what the virus population might look like the next year using the previous year's genetic code, experimental data, or both. Huddleston et al. then compared the predictions with the historical data to find the most useful data types. This showed that the best predictions combined changes from the virus's genetic code with experimental measures of its appearance. This new forecasting tool is open source, allowing teams across the world to start using it to improve their predictions straight away. Seasonal flu infects between 5 and 15% of the world's population every year, causing between quarter of a million and half a million deaths. Better predictions could lead to better flu vaccines and fewer illnesses and deaths ."}

However, recent deep sequencing studies indicate that ubiquitin is highly tolerant to single mutations. We hypothesized that this tolerance would be reduced by chemically induced physiologic perturbations. To test this hypothesis, a class of first year UCSF graduate students employed deep mutational scanning to determine the fitness landscape of all possible single residue mutations in the presence of five different small molecule perturbations. These perturbations uncover 'shared sensitized positions' localized to areas around the hydrophobic patch and the C-terminus. In addition, we identified perturbation specific effects such as a sensitization of His68 in HU and a tolerance to mutation at Lys63 in DTT. Our data show how chemical stresses can reduce buffering effects in the ubiquitin proteasome system. Finally, this study demonstrates the potential of lab-based interdisciplinary graduate curriculum.  Protein homeostasis enables cells to engage in dynamic processes and respond to fluctuating environmental conditions ( Powers et al., 2009 ). Misregulation of proteostasis leads to disease, including many cancers and neurodegenerative diseases ( Balch et al., 2008; Lindquist and Kelly, 2011 ). Protein degradation is an important aspect of this regulation. In eukaryotes ~80% of the proteome is degraded by the highly conserved ubiquitin proteasome system ( UPS ) ( Zolk et al., 2006 ). The high conservation of the UPS is epitomized by ubiquitin ( Ub ), a 76 amino acid protein post-translational modification that is ligated to substrate amine groups, including on Ub itself in poly-Ub linkages, via a three enzyme cascade ( Finley et al., 2012 ). Perhaps due to its central role in regulation, the sequence of ubiquitin has been extremely stable throughout evolution. Only three residues vary between yeast and human ( 96% sequence identity ). This remarkable conservation implies that the UPS does not acquire new functions through mutations in the central player, Ub. Instead the evolution of proteins that add Ub to substrate proteins ( E2/E3 enzymes ), remove Ub ( deubiquitinating enzymes, DUBs ), or recognize Ub ( adaptor proteins ) combine to create new functions, many of which rely on various poly-Ub topologies ( Sharp and Li, 1987; Zuin et al., 2014 ). The role of Lys48 linked poly-Ub in protein degradation ( Thrower et al., 2000 ) appears to be universally conserved, but the functions of other linkages are more plastic. Although mass spectroscopy of cell lysates has shown that every possible poly-Ub lysine linkage exists within yeast cells ( Peng et al., 2003 ), only the roles of Lys11 linked poly-Ub in ERAD ( Xu et al., 2009 ) and Lys63 linked poly-Ub in DNA damage ( Zhang et al., 2011 ) and endocytosis ( Erpapazoglou et al., 2014 ) are well characterized in yeast. Both of these linkages are central to stress responses, mirroring some of the established roles for non-Lys48 linkages in other organisms ( Komander and Rape, 2012 ). Given this central role in coordinating a diverse set of stress responses, perhaps the high sequence conservation of ubiquitin is not surprising. However, classic Alanine-scanning studies showed that ubiquitin is quite tolerant of mutation under normal growth conditions ( Sloper-Mould et al., 2001 ). The high mutational tolerance of Ub was further confirmed using EMPIRIC ( 'extremely methodical and parallel investigation of randomized individual codons' ), where growth rates of yeast strains harboring a nearly comprehensive library of all ubiquitin point mutations were assessed in bulk by deep sequencing ( Roscoe et al., 2013 ). Subsequent studies revealed that many of the constraints on the Ub sequence are enforced directly by the E1-Ub interaction ( Roscoe and Bolon, 2014 ) ; however, the surprisingly high number of tolerant positions remained unexplained. To address the paradox of the high sequence conservation and mutational tolerance of ubiquitin, we posed the problem to the first year students in UCSF\u2019s iPQB ( Integrative Program in Quantitative Biology ) and CCB ( Chemistry & Chemical Biology ) graduate programs. Previous EMPIRIC experiments on HSP90 suggested that reducing protein expression could reveal fitness defects that are otherwise buffered ( Jiang et al., 2013 ). Similarly, the high expression level of Ub might buffer some fitness defects. As an alternative approach to reducing expression, the buffering might also be exposed by chemical perturbations. Chemical-genetic approaches have been successful in elucidating protein function by assessing the context dependence of mutations on organismal fitness ( Hietpas et al., 2013; Stockwell, 2000 ). There is substantial evidence to link the pool of free Ub to the eukaryotic stress responses to many chemicals. For example, Ub overexpression is protective against the general translational inhibitor cycloheximide ( Hanna et al., 2003 ) and the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 is upregulated upon stress to increase the pool of free Ub in the cell ( Hanna et al., 2007 ). Collectively, these results suggest that the sequence of Ub is subject to many constraints arising from interacting with diverse proteins while mediating the stress responses to distinct chemical perturbations. The students performed the bulk competition experiments, deep sequencing and data analysis as part of an 8-week long research class held in a purpose-built Teaching Lab. In small teams of 4\u20135 students working together for 3 afternoons each week, they each examined a chemical stressor: Caffeine, which inhibits TOR and consequently the cell cycle ( Reinke et al., 2006; Wanke et al., 2008 ) ; Dithiothreitol ( DTT ), which reduces disulfides and induces the unfolded protein response ( Frand and Kaiser, 1998 ) and the ER associated decay ( ERAD ) pathway ( Friedlander et al., 2000 ) ; Hydroxyurea ( HU ), which causes pausing during DNA replication and induces DNA damage ( Ko\u00e7 et al., 2004; Petermann et al., 2010 ) ; or MG132, which inhibits the protease activity of the proteasome ( Jensen et al., 1995; Rock et al., 1994 ). We expected MG132 to desensitize the yeast to deleterious mutations in Ub, as the inhibition acts on the final degradation of UPS substrates. For the other three chemicals we expected that specific sites on Ub would become sensitized to mutation. These sites could represent important Ub/protein binding interfaces that are required for Ub to bind to adaptor proteins and ligation machinery required to respond to a specific stress. Furthermore, we expected that Caffeine induced stress would be mediated through Lys48 linked poly-Ub ( cell cycle ), DTT induced stress would be mediated through Lys11 linked poly-Ub ( ERAD ), and HU induced stress would be mediated through Lys63 linked poly-Ub ( DNA damage response ). Our data collectively show that stress reduces a general buffering effect and unmasks a shared set of residues that become less tolerant to mutation. Additionally, we have identified a small set of mutations that are specifically aggravated or alleviated by each chemical. Small fitness defects that are undetectable by EMPIRIC may still be significant over evolutionary timescales and are likely to similarly be enriched for certain chemicals ( Boucher et al., 2014 ). We suggest that expanding the set of environmental stresses, and improved measurement of smaller fitness defects, might be able to explain the high sequence conservation of ubiquitin, as different positions in the protein are important for interactions mediating the specific responses to a wide variety of perturbations.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The ability of an organism to grow and reproduce, that is, it\u2019s \u201cfitness\u201d, is determined by how its genes interact with the environment. Yeast is a model organism in which researchers can control the exact mutations present in the yeast\u2019s genes ( its genotype ) and the conditions in which the yeast cells live ( their environment ). This allows researchers to measure how a yeast cell\u2019s genotype and environment affect its fitness. Ubiquitin is a protein that many organisms depend on to manage cell stress by acting as a tag that targets other proteins for degradation. Essential proteins such as ubiquitin often remain unchanged by mutation over long periods of time. As a result, these proteins evolve very slowly. Like all proteins, ubiquitin is built from a chain of amino acid molecules linked together, and the ubiquitin proteins of yeast and humans are made of almost identical sequences of amino acids. Although ubiquitin has barely changed its sequence over evolution, previous studies have shown that \u2013 under normal growth conditions in the laboratory \u2013 most amino acids in ubiquitin can be mutated without any loss of cell fitness. This led Mavor et al. to hypothesize that treating the yeast cells with chemicals that cause cell stress might lead to amino acids in ubiquitin becoming more sensitive to mutation. To test this idea, a class of graduate students at the University of California, San Francisco grew yeast cells with different ubiquitin mutations together, and with different chemicals that induce cell stress, and measured their growth rates. Sequencing the ubiquitin gene in the thousands of tested yeast cells revealed that three of the chemicals cause a shared set of amino acids in ubiquitin to become more sensitive to mutation. This result suggests that these amino acids are important for the stress response, possibly by altering the ability of yeast cells to target certain proteins for degradation. Conversely, another chemical causes yeast to become more tolerant to changes in the ubiquitin sequence. The experiments also link changes in particular amino acids in ubiquitin to specific stress responses. Mavor et al. show that many of ubquitin\u2019s amino acids are sensitive to mutation under different stress conditions, while others can be mutated to form different amino acids without effecting fitness. By testing the effects of other chemicals, future experiments could further characterize how the yeast\u2019s genotype and environment interact ."}

Increasing evidence implicates the gut microbiota as a key regulator of brain and behavior, yet it remains to be determined if gut bacteria play a role in visceral sensitivity. We used germ-free mice ( GF ) to assess visceral sensitivity, spinal cord gene expression and pain-related brain structures. GF mice displayed visceral hypersensitivity accompanied by increases in Toll-like receptor and cytokine gene expression in the spinal cord, which were normalized by postnatal colonization with microbiota from conventionally colonized ( CC ). In GF mice, the volumes of the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) and periaqueductal grey, areas involved in pain processing, were decreased and enlarged, respectively, and dendritic changes in the ACC were evident. These findings indicate that the gut microbiota is required for the normal visceral pain sensation.  Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system ( CNS ) in a bidirectional manner thereby influencing brain function and behavior ( Sampson and Mazmanian, 2015; Dinan and Cryan, 2012; Mayer, 2011 ). Although the majority of studies investigating the effects of the microbiota on brain function involve animal models of anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction, it is now becoming clear that the gut microbiota may also have a role in other CNS-related conditions, such as visceral pain ( O'Mahony et al., 2014; Gareau et al., 2007; McKernan et al., 2010 ). Abdominal pain, often characterized by visceral hypersensitivity, is a common, and at times, dominant symptom of several gastrointestinal disorders, including functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) ( Enck et al., 2016 ). There is also a high comorbidity among visceral pain and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety ( Felice et al., 2015 ). These painful events are often recurring and unpredictable, which can have a debilitating impact on a person\u2019s daily life ( Quigley, 2006 ). Moreover, many gastrointestinal disorders with visceral pain as a component lack an identifiable pathology and can be difficult to treat with current pharmaceuticals, many of which are associated with undesirable side effects ( Wood, 2013; Moloney et al., 2016 ). The perception of visceral pain is a complex process involving peripheral sensory nerves, and, in the CNS, spinal and cortical pathways as well as areas associated with integration of the experience of pain ( Apkarian et al., 2005 ). Pathological pain states have been associated with altered neuroimmune signaling and glial activation in the spinal cord ( Ji et al., 2013; Grace et al., 2014 ). In the brain, there is a\u00a0significant overlap in areas regulating the affective component of visceral pain and those mediating psychological stress, a major predisposing factor for visceral hypersensitivity ( Larauche et al., 2012 ). Imaging studies in humans with IBS ( Tillisch et al., 2011; Mertz et al., 2000 ) and in animal models of visceral hypersensitivity ( Gibney et al., 2010; Felice et al., 2014; Bliss et al., 2016 ) have revealed increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) in response to both viscerally painful and stressful stimuli. Numerous studies now indicate that the perception of visceral pain can by influenced by the intestinal microbiota. In rodent studies, specific bacterial strains ( probiotics ) have been shown to ameliorate visceral pain induced by stress ( Gareau et al., 2007; McKernan et al., 2010; Ait-Belgnaoui et al., 2006 ) or antibiotic administration ( Verd\u00fa et al., 2006 ), and many probiotics have been shown to benefit humans with abdominal pain ( Clarke et al., 2012 ). Intriguingly, visceral hypersensitivity can be transferred via the microbiota of IBS patients to animals previously lacking microbes ( Crouzet et al., 2013 ). However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of the microbiota on visceral pain perception remain to be elucidated. Integrating these observations, this study is based on the hypothesis that the microbiota is required for the normal processing of visceral pain stimuli. To this end, we used germ-free mice ( GF; mice raised without any exposure to microorganisms ) to study pain-related behavior, genes, and brain structures. We first studied visceral sensitivity, expression of cytokines, Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ), and glial markers in the spinal cord, and mPFC morphology in these animals. Secondly, we determined if postnatal microbial colonization could normalize visceral hypersensitivity and immune status within the spinal cord of GF mice.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The human gut is home to over 100 trillion microbes collectively known as the gut microbiota. These microbes help us to digest food and absorb the nutrients effectively. A diverse and stable community of gut microbes is believed to be important for good health. Recently, it has also become clear that the microbiota can also influence the brain and how we behave. For example, many studies suggest that gut microbiota can alter how an individual perceives pain, but it is not clear how this works. Rodents are often used in experiments as models of human biology. One of the most frequently used rodent models in studies of gut microbes is the \u201cgerm-free\u201d mouse. These mice grow up in laboratory environments that are completely free of microbes, making it possible to study how having no gut microbes affects the health and behaviour of the mice. Luczynski, Tramullas et al. used germ-free mice to study how the gut microbiota influences an animal\u2019s sensitivity to pain. The experiments show that, compared to mice with normal gut microbiota, the germ-free mice were more sensitive to pain from internal organs especially the gut. These mice also produced larger amounts of specific proteins involved in immune responses, which contributed to the animal\u2019s increased sensitivity to pain. Allowing the germ-free mice to be colonised with gut microbes could reverse these changes. The experiments also show that the germ-free mice had changes in the size of two areas of the brain involved in sensing pain: an area called the anterior cingulate cortex was smaller, while the periaqueductal grey region was enlarged. There were also differences in individual nerve cells within the anterior cingulate cortex compared to normal mice. The findings of Luczynski, Tramullas et al. reinforce the idea that the gut microbiota is involved in the sensation of pain from internal organs, and show that hypersensitivity to this form of pain can be reversed later in life by colonising the gut with microbes. Continuing to study the impact of microbes on this type of pain could aid the development of new therapies for the treatment of pain disorders in humans ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nPorphyrias are disorders of heme metabolism frequently characterized by extreme photosensitivity. This symptom results from accumulation of porphyrins, tetrapyrrole intermediates in heme biosynthesis that generate reactive oxygen species when exposed to light, in the skin of affected individuals. Here we report that in addition to producing an ommochrome body pigment, the planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea generates porphyrins in its subepithelial pigment cells under physiological conditions, and that this leads to pigment cell loss when animals are exposed to intense visible light. Remarkably, porphyrin biosynthesis and light-induced depigmentation are enhanced by starvation, recapitulating a common feature of some porphyrias \u2013 decreased nutrient intake precipitates an acute manifestation of the disease. Our results establish planarians as an experimentally tractable animal model for research into the pathophysiology of acute porphyrias, and potentially for the identification of novel pharmacological interventions capable of alleviating porphyrin-mediated photosensitivity or decoupling dieting and fasting from disease pathogenesis.  The prosthetic group heme plays a key role in proteins ( hemoproteins ) with diverse cellular functions, including oxygen binding ( hemoglobin and myoglobin ), electron transfer ( cytochromes ), protection from oxidative stress ( catalases and peroxidases ), and generation of second messengers ( nitric oxide synthase and guanylate cyclase ) ( Ponka, 1999 ). With few exceptions ( Ko\u0159en\u00fd et al., 2012 ), it is essential for viability in all 3 domains of life. Heme is composed of a heterocyclic tetrapyrrole called a porphyrin coordinated to a central iron atom ( some researchers classify the entire heme molecule as a porphyrin, but this term is reserved for the organic ring alone here ). Although naturally occurring auxotrophs have been reported ( Rao et al., 2005; Gruss et al., 2012 ), heme is usually synthesized from the precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, ALA is produced in the mitochondria via condensation of glycine and succinyl CoA by ALA synthase ( ALAS ). This is the first and typically rate-limiting step in the heme biosynthesis pathway, which proceeds in the cytoplasm before returning to the mitochondria ( Layer et al., 2010 ). Like ALAS, the enzymes catalyzing the 7 remaining reactions in the pathway are tightly regulated by ubiquitous and tissue-specific mechanisms ( Ponka, 1997; Balwani and Desnick, 2012 ). Inherited, loss-of-function mutations in any of the heme biosynthesis enzymes downstream of ALAS ( or gain-of-function mutations in ALAS ) cause a group of diseases collectively referred to as porphyrias. These conditions are marked by characteristic clinical features \u2013 neurovisceral symptoms, skin lesions, or both ( Karim et al., 2015 ). While potentially attributable at least in part to heme deficiency, the primary etiology of these symptoms entails a buildup of pathway intermediates due to the bottleneck effect created by underlying mutations. ALA, and possibly also its pyrrole derivative porphobilinogen ( PBG ), is neurotoxic ( Pierach and Edwards, 1978; Adhikari et al., 2006; Felitsyn et al., 2008; Bissell et al., 2015 ). Porphyrins cause cutaneous abnormalities by virtue of their photosensitizing properties. Though generated primarily in the liver or bone marrow, the major sites of heme biosynthesis, they are eventually deposited in other tissues including the dermis. There, they readily absorb light to enter an excited triplet state that reacts with oxygen to produce singlet oxygen. This in turn results in oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, that can ultimately lead to cell death ( Poh-Fitzpatrick, 1986 ). Thus, sunlight, or even bright indoor light, quickly damages exposed skin in many porphyria patients. Clinically, porphyrin-mediated phototoxicity manifests as edema, blistering skin lesions, and in extreme cases, disfiguring scarring and/or tissue loss ( Balwani and Desnick, 2012; Karim et al., 2015 ). A subset of porphyrias classified as \u2018acute\u2019 present with sudden and potentially life-threatening attacks characterized by severe abdominal pain and neurological symptoms ranging from anxiety and confusion to seizures or paralysis ( Balwani and Desnick, 2012; Karim et al., 2015 ). These episodes, which can last for weeks, are triggered by drugs ( e. g., barbiturates ), hormonal changes, dieting/fasting, and other factors that induce hepatic ALAS expression or activity. Accordingly, they are treated with therapies that effect ALAS downregulation. Carbohydrate loading reduces ALAS levels via insulin signaling and an antagonistic effect on its transcriptional coactivator PGC-1\u03b1 ( peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 ) ( Scassa et al., 2004; Handschin et al., 2005 ). This is sometimes effective in ameliorating mild attacks. More severe cases are treated with intravenous heme, which downregulates ALAS expression through a feedback inhibition mechanism ( Bonkowsky et al., 1971; Ponka, 1997 ). A small interfering RNA therapy targeting ALAS decreased plasma ALA and PBG levels in a mouse model of acute porphyria ( Yasuda et al., 2014 ), and entered clinical trials in 2015 ( Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, 2016, NCT02452372 ). Given their toxic effects in porphyrias, it is interesting to note that porphyrins accumulate under physiological circumstances in some organisms. Porphyrins or their derivatives are pigments in the wing feathers of owls ( With, 1978; Weidensaul, 2011 ), the brilliant crimson flight feathers of turacos ( With, 1957 ), and numerous invertebrate lineages including earthworms, molluscs, and deep-sea medusae ( Kennedy, 1975 ). It has been known for close to a century that high levels of porphyrins are present in the rodent Harderian gland ( Derrien and Turchini, 1924 ), as well as in multiple tissues of the fox squirrel Sciurus niger ( Turner, 1937 ), though the significance of these observations remains mysterious. Porphyrins are also produced by bacteria such as Propionibacterium acnes, a commensal skin microbe that contributes to the pathogenesis of acne ( Lee et al., 1978 ). In summary, porphyrins appear to have important, but often uncharacterized functions independent of their more well-known roles as precursors to their metal-coordinated counterparts ( e. g., heme and the magnesium porphyrin chlorophyll ). Here we extend previous biochemical studies documenting physiological porphyrin biosynthesis in the planarian Girardia ( formerly Dugesia ) dorotocephala ( MacRae, 1956; 1959; 1961; 1963 ) by showing the related planarian species Schmidtea mediterranea uses the first 3 enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway to generate porphyrins in its subepithelial pigment cells. We further demonstrate that porphyrins sensitize S. mediterranea to intense visible light, causing pigment cell loss in animals subjected to prolonged light exposure. This response is accelerated with starvation, echoing the connection between dieting or fasting and the symptomatic attacks experienced by acute porphyria patients. In addition to serving as a popular model organism for regeneration research ( Gentile et al., 2011; Reddien, 2013; Adler and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2015 ), our observations establish planarians as an invertebrate model for in vivo studies of porphyrin photosensitization, as well as metabolic inputs into the pathophysiology of acute porphyrias.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Porphyrias are rare diseases that involve ring-shaped molecules called porphyrins accumulating in various parts of the body. Porphyrins are produced as part of the normal process that makes an important molecule called heme, which is required to transport oxygen. However, high levels of porphyrins can be toxic. For example, porphyrins deposited in the skin can cause swelling and blistering when the skin is exposed to bright light. Other disease symptoms include neurological issues ranging from anxiety and confusion to seizures or paralysis. It has been speculated that porphyrias may have affected several historical figures, including the artist Vincent van Gogh. In addition to their role in heme production, porphyrins also have other roles. For example, they are used as pigments in the wing feathers of some owls. Researchers are trying to understand more about how organisms regulate porphyrin production so that it might be possible to develop more effective treatments for porphyria in humans. Here, Stubenhaus et al. studied how a flatworm called Schmidtea mediterranea makes porphyrins. A group of undergraduate students noticed that these animals \u2013 which are normally brown in color \u2013 turned white when they were exposed to sunlight for several days. Stubenhaus et al. found that S. mediterranea makes porphyrins in the pigment cells of its skin using the same genes that make porphyrins in humans. Together with other molecules called ommochromes, the porphyrins give rise to the normal color of this flatworm. However, when the animals are exposed to intense light for extended periods of time, which is unlikely to occur in the wild, porphyrin production leads to loss of the pigment cells. The experiments also show that starvation increases the rate of pigment cell loss in light-exposed flatworms, which mirrors the worsening of disease symptoms some porphyria patients experience when they diet or fast. Stubenhaus et al. propose that flatworms are useful models in which to study the molecular processes that are responsible for porphyrias in humans. Further research is required to determine the exact chemical structure of the porphyrin and ommochrome molecules produced in different flatworm species. Stubenhaus et al. also plan to use flatworms to screen for drugs that could potentially be developed into new treatments for porphyria ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nGenetic effects on gene expression and splicing can be modulated by cellular and environmental factors; yet interactions between genotypes, cell type, and treatment have not been comprehensively studied together. We used an induced pluripotent stem cell system to study multiple cell types derived from the same individuals and exposed them to a large panel of treatments. Cellular responses involved different genes and pathways for gene expression and splicing and were highly variable across contexts. For thousands of genes, we identified variable allelic expression across contexts and characterized different types of gene-environment interactions, many of which are associated with complex traits. Promoter functional and evolutionary features distinguished genes with elevated allelic imbalance mean and variance. On average, half of the genes with dynamic regulatory interactions were missed by large eQTL mapping studies, indicating the importance of exploring multiple treatments to reveal previously unrecognized regulatory loci that may be important for disease.  Cells exist within complex environments, where levels of metabolites and signaling molecules can change rapidly. In order to thrive under such conditions, cells have evolved mechanisms to control gene expression in response to environmental perturbation. Variation in environmental exposure can explain variation in gene expression in human population samples ( Gibson, 2008; Idaghdour et al., 2010; Fav\u00e9 et al., 2018; Aguirre-Gamboa et al., 2016; Horst et al., 2016; Maghbooli et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015 ). For example, a highly correlated cluster of surfactant-related genes was found to be highly expressed in lung tissue from GTEx donors who died while on a ventilator ( McCall et al., 2016 ). Similarly, thousands of gene expression differences were identified between sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed skin ( Kita and Fraser, 2016 ). In addition to changing gene expression, environmental exposures are also able to alter splicing processes ( Pai and Luca, 2019 ). This may be a direct effect of the environment altering normal splicing patterns, as well as the result of a compensatory effect initiated by the cell to overcome a stressful situation. Splicing is an important co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional process taking place within the nucleus, in which portions of pre-mRNAs called introns are removed, and others called exons are joined together to form a mature transcript ( Ule and Blencowe, 2019 ). All forms of splicing require a variable set of proteins and small nuclear RNAs to form small-nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNPs ), ultimately giving rise to the spliceosome ( Wahl et al., 2009 ) which, together with a variable set of accessory proteins ( Han et al., 2017; Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al., 2018 ) finely tune splicing. Expression of both spliceosomal and accessory factors may be influenced by the environment, which means the environment is eventually able to alter splicing processes ( Richards et al., 2017 ). It is widely accepted that gene expression varies across individuals and that such variation is under genetic control. Expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ) mapping in samples from a variety of tissues has elucidated the tissue specificity of the genetic control of gene expression ( van der Wijst et al., 2018; Dimas et al., 2009; Flutre et al., 2013 ). Specifically, the GTEx consortium observed a U-shaped pattern for eQTL tissue specificity, with eQTLs tending to be either highly shared amongst tissues or highly tissue-specific ( The Gtex Consortium, 2020 ). These findings underscore the importance of evaluating the genetic control of gene expression across cell and tissue types. To address the environment-specific control of gene expression, eQTL studies performed on in vitro treated cells from many donors are commonly used. The resulting genetic variants which influence gene expression response are known as response eQTL ( reQTL ) and represent gene-environment interactions ( G\u00d7E ) for molecular phenotypes. reQTL have been identified for infectious agents, drugs, and hormones, among other stimuli/perturbations ( Knowles et al., 2018; Manry et al., 2017; N\u00e9d\u00e9lec et al., 2016; Alasoo et al., 2018; Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2017; Quach et al., 2016; \u00c7al\u0131\u015fkan et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2014; Fairfax et al., 2014; Maranville et al., 2011; Mangravite et al., 2013; Barreiro et al., 2012; Alasoo et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2021 ). These studies have consistently shown that genes with G\u00d7E on gene expression are enriched for association with complex traits. However, given the large sample sizes needed to detect reQTLs, only a small number of conditions in a limited number of cell types can be tested at one time. Allele-specific expression ( ASE ) is an alternative to eQTL mapping to identify the genetic control of gene expression. Rather than associating a genetic variant with gene expression, ASE uses heterozygous sites within coding regions to measure allelic imbalance in RNA-seq reads. A significant allelic imbalance within an individual implies cis-regulatory variation, as the trans-environment is constant. Similar to reQTL mapping, differences in ASE between environmental conditions is indicative of G\u00d7E, and we refer to such SNPs as conditional ASE ( cASE ) ( Moyerbrailean et al., 2016 ). cASE has important implications for human health. For example, nearly 50% of genes with cASE were involved in complex traits by GWAS, which is significantly greater than ASE or eQTL genes ( Moyerbrailean et al., 2016 ). Unlike reQTL mapping, ASE can identify G\u00d7E in small sample sizes, thereby allowing for interrogation of a broader spectrum of environmental exposures ( Moyerbrailean et al., 2016 ). While gene expression is governed by both genetic and environmental factors, it is subject to fluctuations due to stochastic factors ( Raser and O\u2019Shea, 2004 ). This noise in gene expression is gene-specific, dependent on promoter elements, and can be affected by genetic mutation ( Raser and O\u2019Shea, 2004; Mogno et al., 2010 ), indicating its importance in gene regulation. Indeed, there has been selection to minimize gene expression noise in yeast ( Lehner, 2008 ), and gene expression variation has been linked to differential gene expression in response to perturbation in flies and humans ( Sigalova et al., 2020 ). While the importance of variation in gene expression has been clearly established, much less is known on variation in the genetic control of gene expression. Taking advantage of the reduced sample size needed to measure genetic effects by ASE, we have established a system to measure the genetic effects on gene expression in three cell types from six individuals across a large number of environmental conditions. This study design allows us to simultaneously quantify context ( cell type and environment ) dependent and genetic effects on gene expression. In addition to identifying thousands of instances of cASE, we have partitioned the variance in gene and allelic expression into individual, treatment, and cell type components, illustrating how each of these components can influence genetic control.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The activity of the genes in a cell depends on the type of cell they are in, the interactions with other genes, the environment and genetics. Active genes produce a greater number of mRNA molecules, which act as messenger molecules to instruct the cell to produce proteins. The amount of mRNA molecules in cells can be measured to assess the levels of gene activity. Genes produce mRNAs through a process called transcription, and the collection of all the mRNA molecules in a cell is called the transcriptome. Cells obtained from human samples can be grown in the lab under different conditions, and this can be used to transform them into different types of cells. These cells can then be exposed to different treatments \u2013 such as specific chemicals \u2013 to understand how the environment affects them. Cells derived from different people may respond differently to the same treatment based on their unique genetics. Exposing different types of cells from many people to different treatments can help explain how genetics, the environment and cell type affect gene activity. Findley et al. grew three different types of cells from six different people in the lab. The cells were exposed to 28 different treatments, which reflect different environmental changes. Studying all these different factors together allowed Findley et al. to understand how genetics, cell type and environment affect the activity of over 53, 000 genes. Around half of the effects due to an interaction between genetics and the environment and had not been seen in other larger studies of the transcriptome. Many of these newly observed changes are in genes that have connections to different diseases, including heart disease. The results of Findley et al. provide evidence indicating to which extent lifestyle and the environment can interact with an individual\u2019s genetic makeup to impact gene activity and long-term health. The more researchers can understand these factors, the more useful they can be in helping to predict, detect and treat illnesses. The findings also show how genes and the environment interact, which may be relevant to understanding disease development. There is more work to be done to understand a wider range of environmental factors across more cell types. It will also be important to establish how this work on cells grown in the lab translates to human health ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nDuring infection, pathogens are starved of essential nutrients such as iron and tryptophan by host immune effectors. Without conserved global stress response regulators, how the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis arrives at a physiologically similar \u2018persistent\u2019 state in response to starvation of either nutrient remains unclear. Here, we report on the iron-dependent regulation of the trpRBA tryptophan salvage pathway in C. trachomatis. Iron starvation specifically induces trpBA expression from a novel promoter element within an intergenic region flanked by trpR and trpB. YtgR, the only known iron-dependent regulator in Chlamydia, can bind to the trpRBA intergenic region upstream of the alternative trpBA promoter to repress transcription. Simultaneously, YtgR binding promotes the termination of transcripts from the primary promoter upstream of trpR. This is the first description of an iron-dependent mechanism regulating prokaryotic tryptophan biosynthesis that may indicate the existence of novel approaches to gene regulation and stress response in Chlamydia.  Nutrient acquisition is critical for the success of pathogenic bacteria. Many pathogenic bacteria must siphon nutrients from their hosts, such as nucleotides, amino acids and biometals ( Brown et al., 2008; Eisenreich et al., 2010; Ray et al., 2009; Skaar, 2010 ). This common feature among pathogens renders them susceptible to nutrient limitation strategies associated with the host immune response ( Hood and Skaar, 2012 ). Counteractively, bacterial pathogens have evolved sophisticated molecular mechanisms to respond to nutrient deprivation, involving increasingly complex and sophisticated nutrient-sensing regulatory networks. These stress response mechanisms are essential for pathogens to avoid clearance by the immune system. By delineating their function at the molecular level, we can better target aspects of the host-pathogen interface suitable for therapeutic manipulation. However, stress responses in the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis are relatively poorly characterized, leaving unanswered many fundamental questions about the biology of this pathogen. C. trachomatis is the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) and infection-derived preventable blindness worldwide ( CDC, 2017; Newman et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2014 ). Genital infections of chlamydia disproportionately affect women and are associated with serious sequelae in the female reproductive tract such as tubal factor infertility ( Hafner, 2015 ). Chlamydiae are Gram-negative bacterial parasites that develop within a pathogen-specified membrane-bound organelle termed the inclusion ( Moore and Ouellette, 2014 ). Chlamydial development is uniquely characterized by a biphasic interconversion of an infectious elementary body ( EB ) with a non-infectious, but replicative reticulate body ( RB ) ( Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005 ). An obligate intracellular lifestyle has led to reductive genome evolution across chlamydial species; Chlamydiae have retained genes uniquely required for their survival, but have become nutritionally dependent on their hosts by discarding many metabolism-related genes ( Clarke, 2011 ). Of note, C. trachomatis does not possess genes necessary for eliciting a stringent response to nutrient starvation ( e. g. relA, spoT ), suggesting that this pathogen may utilize novel mechanisms to respond to nutrient stress ( Stephens et al., 1998 ). It is well established that in response to various stressors, Chlamydiae deviate from their normal developmental program to initiate an aberrant developmental state, termed \u2018persistence\u2019 ( Wyrick, 2010 ). This persistent state is distinguished by the presence of viable, but non-cultivable, abnormally enlarged chlamydial organisms that display dysregulated gene expression. Importantly, Chlamydia can be reactivated from persistence by abatement of the stress condition. As such, chlamydial persistence at least superficially resembles a global stress response mechanism. Yet the mechanistic underpinnings of this phenotype are poorly understood, with most published studies focusing on the molecular and metabolic character of the aberrant, persistent form. It is therefore unclear to what extent primary stress responses contribute to the global persistent phenotype in Chlamydia. The best described inducer of persistence is the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma ( IFN-\u03b3 ). The bacteriostatic effect of IFN-\u03b3 has been primarily attributed to host cell tryptophan ( Trp ) catabolism, an amino acid for which C. trachomatis is auxotrophic ( Byrne et al., 1986; Fehlner-Gardiner et al., 2002; Taylor and Feng, 1991 ). Following IFN-\u03b3 stimulation, infected host cells up-regulate expression of indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase ( IDO1 ), which catabolizes Trp to N-formylkynurenine via cleavage of the indole ring ( Macchiarulo et al., 2009 ). C. trachomatis cannot recycle kynurenines, unlike some other chlamydial species ( Wood et al., 2004 ), and thus IFN-\u03b3 stimulation effectively results in Trp starvation to C. trachomatis. The primary regulatory response to Trp starvation in C. trachomatis is mediated by a TrpR ortholog, whose Trp-dependent binding to cognate promoter elements represses transcription ( Akers and Tan, 2006; Carlson et al., 2006 ). This mechanism of regulatory control is presumably limited in C. trachomatis, as homologs of genes regulated by TrpR in other bacteria ( e. g. trpF, aroH, aroL ) have not been shown to respond to Trp limitation ( Wood et al., 2003 ). In many Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, trpR is monocistronic and distal to the Trp biosynthetic operon. In C. trachomatis, TrpR is encoded in an operon, trpRBA, which also contains the Trp synthase \u03b1- and \u03b2- subunits ( TrpA and TrpB, respectively ), and possesses a 348 base-pair ( bp ) intergenic region ( IGR ) that separates trpR from trpBA. TrpBA catalyzes the final steps of Trp biosynthesis in bacteria; TrpA converts indoleglycerol-3-phosphate ( IGP ) to indole which is then condensed with serine by TrpB to form Trp. In C. trachomatis, TrpA cannot bind IGP and thus C. trachomatis requires indole as a substrate to synthesize Trp ( Fehlner-Gardiner et al., 2002 ). Despite significant research on the chlamydial trpRBA operon, the functional significance of the trpRBA IGR is poorly characterized. While a putative TrpR operator sequence was identified in the IGR overlapping an alternative transcriptional origin for trpBA ( Carlson et al., 2006 ), TrpR binding was not observed ( Akers and Tan, 2006 ). Based on in silico predictions, an attenuator sequence has been annotated within the trpRBA IGR ( Merino and Yanofsky, 2005 ), but this has not been thoroughly validated experimentally. Regardless, the IGR is\u00a0>99% conserved at the nucleotide sequence level across ocular, genital and lymphogranuloma venereum ( LGV ) serovars of C. trachomatis, indicating functional importance ( Carlson et al., 2005; Seth-Smith et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 1998; Thomson et al., 2008 ). Therefore, outside of TrpR-mediated repression, the complete detail of trpRBA regulation remains poorly elucidated and previous reports have indicated the possibility of more complex mechanisms of regulation ( Brinkworth et al., 2018 ). The requirement of TrpBA for C. trachomatis to survive IFN-\u03b3-mediated Trp starvation is well documented. However, IFN-\u03b3 is also known to limit iron and other essential biometals to intracellular pathogens as a component of host nutritional immunity ( Cassat and Skaar, 2013; Hood and Skaar, 2012 ). Whether C. trachomatis has adapted to respond to these various IFN-\u03b3-mediated insults remains unclear. Chlamydia have a strict iron dependence for normal development, evidenced by the onset of persistence following prolonged iron limitation ( Raulston, 1997 ). Importantly, Chlamydia presumably acquire iron via vesicular interactions between the chlamydial inclusion and slow-recycling transferrin ( Tf ) -containing endosomes ( Ouellette and Carabeo, 2010 ). IFN-\u03b3 is known to down-regulate transferrin receptor ( TfR ) expression in both monocytes and epithelial cells with replicative consequences for resident intracellular bacteria ( Byrd and Horwitz, 1993; Byrd and Horwitz, 1989; Igietseme et al., 1998; Nairz et al., 2008 ). However, iron homeostasis in Chlamydia is poorly understood due to the lack of functionally characterized homologs to iron acquisition machinery that are highly conserved in other bacteria ( Pokorzynski et al., 2017 ). Only the ytgABCD operon, encoding a metal permease, has been clearly linked to iron acquisition ( Miller et al., 2009 ). Intriguingly, the YtgC ( CTL0325 ) open reading frame ( ORF ) encodes a N-terminal permease domain fused to a C-terminal DtxR-like repressor domain, annotated YtgR ( Akers et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2012 ). YtgR is cleaved from the permease domain during infection and functions as an iron-dependent transcriptional repressor to autoregulate the expression of its own operon ( Thompson et al., 2012 ). YtgR represents the only identified iron-dependent transcriptional regulator in Chlamydia. Whether YtgR maintains a more diverse transcriptional regulon beyond the ytgABCD operon has not yet been addressed and remains an intriguing question in the context of immune-mediated iron limitation to C. trachomatis. Consistent with the highly reduced capacity of the chlamydial genome, it is likely that C. trachomatis has a limited ability to tailor a specific response to each individual stress. In the absence of identifiable homologs for most global stress response regulators in C. trachomatis, we hypothesized that primary stress responses to pleiotropic insults may involve mechanisms of co-regulation by stress-responsive transcription factors. Here, we report on the unique iron-dependent regulation of the trpRBA operon in Chlamydia trachomatis. We propose a model of iron-dependent transcriptional regulation of trpRBA mediated by the repressor YtgR binding specifically to the IGR, which would enable C. trachomatis to respond similarly to the antimicrobial deprivation of Trp or iron mediated by IFN-\u03b3. Such a mechanism of iron-dependent regulation of Trp biosynthesis has not been previously described in any other prokaryote and adds to the catalog of regulatory models for Trp biosynthetic operons in bacteria. Further, it reveals a highly dynamic mode of regulatory integration within the trpRBA operon, employing bipartite control at the transcription initiation and termination steps.

Chlamydia trachomatis, a bacterium that causes many sexually-transmitted infections, is no exception. These bacteria do not normally make one of the building blocks of proteins, the amino acid tryptophan, but instead scavenge it from their human host. One way that the immune system tries to fight a chlamydia infection is by cutting off the supply of tryptophan in an attempt to starve the bacteria. But the microbes have evolved to respond to these hardships and keep themselves alive. The \u2018tryptophan salvage pathway\u2019 is a set of genes that, when switched on, allows the Chlamydia bacteria to take up a molecule found in the female genital tract that they can use to make their own tryptophan. Yet, how do the bacteria know when to activate these genes ? Tryptophan starvation is not the only strategy that the immune system uses to fight chlamydia. It also restricts the supply of the essential metal iron to these bacteria. Now, using human cells grown in the laboratory and infected with Chlamydia bacteria, Pokorzynski et al. show that iron starvation switches on the tryptophan salvage pathway. Chlamydia most likely senses changes in iron levels via a protein called YtgR, and a closer look at the bacterial DNA revealed that YtgR interacts with the genes of the tryptophan salvage pathway. When iron levels were high, YtgR locked on to the DNA in the middle of this set of genes. This effectively switched off the genes on either side of the binding site. When iron levels dropped, YtgR came away from the DNA, releasing the genes and allowing the cell to use them to start making its own tryptophan. Together these findings indicate that, when the bacteria sense that iron levels have dropped, they prepare for a shortage of tryptophan too. Chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Left untreated, it can cause infertility and blindness. This and future studies aimed at understanding how these bacteria respond to immune attack may reveal new ways to prevent or treat these infections ."}

Yet such descriptions fail to capture the dynamics of decision formation. Describing dynamic neural processes has proven challenging due to the problem of indexing the internal state of PFC and its trial-by-trial variation. Using primate neurophysiology and human magnetoencephalography, we here recover a single-trial index of PFC internal states from multiple simultaneously recorded PFC subregions. This index can explain the origins of neural representations of economic variables in PFC. It describes the relationship between neural dynamics and behaviour in both human and monkey PFC, directly bridging between human neuroimaging data and underlying neuronal activity. Moreover, it reveals a functionally dissociable interaction between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral PFC in guiding cost-benefit decisions. We cast our observations in terms of a recurrent neural network model of choice, providing formal links to mechanistic dynamical accounts of decision-making.  Correlates of decision variables are routinely found in prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) during value-guided decision making ( Clithero and Rangel, 2014; Kennerley and Walton, 2011 ). They have been richly described using static, economic models of choice ( Glimcher and Fehr, 2014 ). Neuroeconomic accounts explain firing rates of single neurons or human neuroimaging data in terms of experimental variables that motivate choice behaviour. These include the magnitude or likelihood of available reward, and the costs involved in obtaining those rewards. By forming neural representations of such quantities, it is argued that the brain can use these representations to guide selection of the most valuable alternative. Our present understanding of economic decision formation has been founded upon careful study of neural representations of value and how they differ across PFC subregions ( Glimcher and Fehr, 2014; Rushworth et al., 2012; Rangel and Hare, 2010 ). However, an alternative perspective on the origins of neural representations during decision making stems from choice models from mathematical psychology ( Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993 ). Such models seek to explain decisions in terms of their temporal evolution or dynamics. Whilst originally accounting for temporally varying features of behaviour, such as reaction times and eye gaze ( Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993; Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998; Krajbich et al., 2010 ), they have also successfully captured temporally varying features of neural activity, most notably in the lateral intraparietal cortex ( LIP ) during perceptual choice ( Shadlen and Newsome, 2001; Gold and Shadlen, 2007 ). These psychological models can also be related to other dynamical models ( Bogacz et al., 2006 ) such as nonlinear attractor network models firmly rooted in neurobiology ( Wang, 2002 ). The common feature of both psychological and neurobiological accounts is that they focus on the temporal evolution of a decision signal across time, rather than the strength with which it represents decision variables at a particular fixed point in time. Contrasting the two perspectives, it becomes apparent that even if neuronal activity underwent the exact same physiological process on different trials ( such as a ramp-to-threshold ), it might nevertheless appear to represent certain economic features of a decision. Put simply, as the decision unfolds, neural activity will be higher on trials that ramp quickly than on those that ramp slowly. It will therefore correlate with any variable that affects the decision speed, and this effect will appear most prominent at timepoints in the trial when the ramping process, or rate of change, is maximal. Even in more complex dynamical situations, it is easy to see how economic variables that predict the rate of change would appear to be represented in neural activity if analysed without knowledge of the underlying dynamics. This might particularly be true of the value of the chosen item ( \u2018chosen value\u2019 ), which strongly affects behavioural reaction times in economic choice tasks. This should then influence how we interpret the meaning of such activity ( Hunt, 2014; O\u2019Doherty, 2014 ). The neuroeconomic perspective often labels chosen value representations as a \u2018post-decision\u2019 signal, arguing that chosen value signals do not reflect the decision competition itself but instead the outcome of the comparison process ( Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012; Blanchard and Hayden, 2014 ). One interpretation of such representations is that they are needed for subsequent computation of a reward prediction error ( Rangel and Hare, 2010 ). Yet the dynamical perspective proposes that they may in fact originate as a consequence of time evolving decision processes. Rather than casting a chosen value representation as signaling \u2018pre-decision\u2019 or \u2018post-decision\u2019 variables to downstream brain areas, it argues that such correlates inevitably emerge as a decision is made. In its most extreme form, this hypothesis might contend that chosen value signals would be fully accounted for by variation in underlying decision rates. To assess this proposal more carefully, it becomes critical to index how neural dynamics unfold on individual trials. In PFC, tackling this problem provides unique challenges. Several recent studies have recovered single-trial dynamical information in structures close to motor output, based upon neuronal spiking data ( Thura and Cisek, 2014; Kaufman et al., 2015; Murakami et al., 2014; Bollimunta et al., 2012; Kiani et al., 2014; Carnevale et al., 2015 ). Yet the distance of PFC from either sensory input or motor output produces neural activity that is poorly aligned with simple features of the experimental task ( Rigotti et al., 2013 ). Attempts to understand PFC activity should therefore extract its dynamical state based on neural information alone, rather than first sorting spike trains by motor output or experimental variables as is common in other approaches. It is also unclear whether neuronal firing rates are in fact the most reliable source of single-trial information. The esotericism of PFC neuronal responses is compounded by a high degree of stochasticity in neuronal spike trains, delivering statistical challenges to obtaining single-trial information ( Churchland et al., 2007; Park et al., 2014 ). Current techniques sometimes overcome this problem by examining tens or hundreds of simultaneously recorded single neurons ( Churchland et al., 2007 ). Whilst this can be fruitful, such data is rarely available in humans, where the contribution of PFC to value-guided choice is most critical. In the present study, we therefore sought an alternative index of single-trial neural dynamics that overcame these limitations. We focussed on observations at the mesoscopic scale of the local field potential ( LFP ). One advantage of this approach is that it can be easily related to simultaneously recorded neuronal spike trains on a trial-by-trial basis in animals, but also underlies the magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) signal observable in humans ( Buzs\u00e1ki et al., 2012 ). As such, we could recover dynamical information from electrophysiology recordings in macaque monkeys and also from non-invasive magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) recordings in humans. This provides an important bridge between observations at microscopic ( cellular ) and macroscopic ( whole-brain ) scales. Importantly, our index provides information about the speed of a local internal neural decision process that goes beyond a simple behavioural measure of reaction time. Using this index, we could draw several new conclusions about PFC activity during choice. We first demonstrate a temporal evolution from action value difference to chosen action signals that are selectively present in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) neurons, but not anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) or orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ). This contrasts against the ubiquitous encoding across all three subregions of \u2018chosen value\u2019. However, we then demonstrate that correlates of chosen value may arise as a consequence of dynamical processing, as opposed to being purely represented as a neuroeconomic post-decision variable. Next, by simultaneously indexing decision formation across multiple PFC subregions, we show that functional interactions can be reshaped in a task-dependent manner. We find that OFC and ACC dynamics selectively influence dorsolateral DLPFC activity on delay- and effort-based decisions respectively. Finally, our observations can be related to predictions from a dynamical neural network model of choice. This provides formal links to established dynamical mechanisms underlying perceptual decision-making.

While constructing a new railway line, a mistimed explosion propelled an iron bar into the base of his skull, where it passed behind his left eye before exiting through the top of his head. Gage survived the accident, but those who knew him reported significant changes in his personality and behaviour. Gage\u2019s ability to make decisions was particularly impaired by his injury. Decision-making involves weighing up the costs and benefits associated with alternative courses of action. It entails looking into the future to decide whether an anticipated reward will justify the effort or expense necessary to obtain it. This process is dependent on a region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, the area that sustained the most damage in Phineas Gage. While many studies have shown correlations between activity in particular parts of prefrontal cortex and the outcome of decisions, little is known about how this activity evolves over time as a decision is made. To explore this process, Hunt et al. trained macaque monkeys to choose between pairs of images that were associated with specific rewards ( quantities of fruit juice ) and costs ( either amounts of work or fixed delays ). Electrode recordings revealed changes in prefrontal activity that varied over time as the monkeys deliberated over each pair of images, choosing for example between a large reward after a long delay versus a smaller reward immediately. This activity was consistent with a mathematical model of decision-making, which also explains data from brain imaging experiments in humans. This provides an important link between human data and electrode recordings in animals. However, some of the patterns of activity observed in both macaques and humans appeared to reflect the speed at which decisions were made, rather than the outcome of the decisions themselves. By extracting information about decision speed on each decision from each region, it was shown that communication between regions of prefrontal cortex changes when choices are between two different amounts of work, as opposed to two different delays. Further experiments are needed to explore this phenomenon and to determine how other brain regions interact with the prefrontal cortex to support the decision-making process ."}

By following the motion of individual heads with interferometric scattering microscopy at nm spatial and ms temporal precision we found that the detached head occupies a loosely fixed position to one side of actin from which it rebinds in a controlled manner while executing a step. Improving the spatial precision to the sub-nm regime provided evidence for an \u00e5ngstrom-level structural transition in the motor domain associated with the power stroke. Simultaneous tracking of both heads revealed that consecutive steps follow identical paths to the same side of actin in a compass-like spinning motion demonstrating a symmetrical walking pattern. These results visualize many of the critical unknown aspects of the stepping mechanism of myosin 5 including head\u2013head coordination, the origin of lever-arm motion and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the translocating head during individual steps.  Myosin 5a moves in a hand-over-hand fashion with individual heads moving by 74 nm and the center of mass by 37 nm for each step ( Vale, 2003; Sellers and Veigel, 2006; Hammer and Sellers, 2012 ). A finely tuned kinetic sequence of ATP binding, hydrolysis, phosphate release and eventually ADP release by the enzymatic heads enables processive motion towards the \u2018+\u2019 end of actin filaments ( De La Cruz et al., 1999; De La Cruz and Ostap, 2004; Rosenfeld and Sweeney, 2004; Sakamoto et al., 2008; Forgacs et al., 2008 ). One of the most remarkable aspects of myosin 5a is the efficient conversion of chemical energy by the molecular-sized enzymatic heads into a translation of 74 nm along a 7 nm diameter actin filament in the presence of Brownian motion and a crowded cellular environment. Crystal structures of myosin 5a exist either with or without nucleotide, but only in the detached state ( Coureux et al., 2003, 2004 ). Although these structures served as a model for the structural changes potentially induced by binding to actin, ( Volkmann et al., 2005 ) the internally coupled rearrangement of the subdomains leading to ADP and phosphate release or dissociation from actin upon ATP binding could only be studied in silico ( Cecchini et al., 2008, 2010; Sweeney and Houdusse, 2010; Preller and Holmes, 2013 ). The experimental challenge in revealing such structural dynamics has been largely of spatiotemporal origin, since they are likely on the \u00c5ngstrom scale and may be very transient. Similarly, there has been considerable interest in directly revealing the motion of the individual heads as myosin steps along actin in an attempt to unravel the origins of efficient motion on the nanoscale. Single molecule studies employing optical trapping ( Mehta et al., 1999; Rief et al., 2000 ) and fluorescence imaging ( Forkey et al., 2003; Yildiz et al., 2003; Snyder et al., 2004; Warshaw et al., 2005 ) have either reported periods of increased flexibility, ( Veigel et al., 2002; Dunn and Spudich, 2007; Beausang et al., 2013 ) or partitioning of the step into sub-events ( Veigel et al., 2002; Uemura et al., 2004; Cappello et al., 2007; Sellers and Veigel, 2010 ). All resulting models involve a forward aiming power stroke followed by a Brownian search mechanism ( Veigel et al., 2002; Okada et al., 2007; Shiroguchi and Kinosita, 2007; Karagiannis et al., 2014 ). The power stroke of the attached head contributes only partially to the step by moving the pivot point that facilitates Brownian rotation of the unbound head. The bias towards the next binding site is believed to be provided by the recovery stroke and its stability, but how unidirectional stepping is achieved in the presence of such a large and mostly random motion remains unclear ( Shiroguchi et al., 2011 ). The first passage time of the translocating head is expected to be on the order of 100 \u00b5s, ( Veigel et al., 2002; Hinczewski et al., 2013 ) although the head spends tens of ms in the unbound state given the maximum rates of ATP hydrolysis and binding to actin ( Veigel et al., 2002; Dunn and Spudich, 2007; Beausang et al., 2013 ). Any technique aiming to visualize the structural dynamics of the motor domain or the motion of the unattached head would thus have to achieve simultaneous millisecond temporal and nanometer spatial precision. Optical trapping operates in this spatiotemporal regime, but it is not possible to monitor the motion of the unattached head without significant perturbation. Smaller labels affixed to the myosin motor domain or to calmodulin molecules on the lever arm, as available in fluorescence imaging, do not suffer from this limitation, but cannot provide sufficient localization precision on the millisecond time scale. We therefore designed an assay based on interferometric scattering microscopy ( iSCAT ), ( Kukura et al., 2009; Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura, 2012 ) a technique that has recently been shown to enable simultaneous high-speed and high-precision imaging of 20 nm diameter or smaller nanoscale scattering labels ( Andrecka et al., 2013; Ortega Arroyo et al., 2014 ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells use motor proteins that to move organelles and other cargos from one place to another. The myosins are a family of motor proteins that pull cargo along filaments made of another protein called actin. The \u2018head\u2019 end of myosin attaches to the actin filament and the \u2018tail\u2019 end binds to the cargo. The head and tail are connected by a flexible linker that allows the protein to change shape. The tails of two myosin molecules bind together to form a two-headed motor that can move along an actin filament by taking 74 nm steps. At the start of each step, both heads are attached to the actin with one in front of the other. The leading head remains attached while the rear head detaches from actin and moves in front of the leading head reattaching to actin. These movements are repeated many times to allow the motor to move along the filament, much like a tightrope walker walking along a wire. However, it is not known how the motor can move so efficiently along the actin while managing to avoid falling off its track. Here, Andrecka et al. analyzed the movement of the myosin 5 motor in real time using a method called \u2018interferometric scattering microscopy\u2019. The experiments show that when a head detaches from the actin, it is temporarily held out to one side of the actin filament. From here, this detached head sways back and forth, until it takes a step forward and binds firmly to the next position on the filament. Both heads follow identical paths along the actin filament, and so the movement resembles the way that a drawing or dividing compass can be used to measure distances on a map. Andrecka et al. 's findings shed new light on how myosin motors move along actin. This may become a blueprint for efficient nano-mechanical motion and could therefore be important for designing artificial machines that operate on the nanoscale ."}

In this report, we provide converging evidence indicating that a splice variant isoform of the Acbd7 mRNA is expressed and translated by some POMC and GABAergic-neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus ( ARC ). We have demonstrated that the ARC ACBD7 isoform was produced and processed into a bioactive peptide referred to as nonadecaneuropeptide ( NDN ) in response to catabolic signals. We have characterized NDN as a potent anorexigenic signal acting through an uncharacterized endozepine G protein-coupled receptor and subsequently via the melanocortin system. Our results suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons participate in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons are involved in the hypothalamic control exerted on food intake and energy expenditure by the leptin-melanocortin pathway.  The understanding of the complex brain controls of food intake and energy expenditure is essential to unravel the causes of excess fat deposition and to envision effective strategies to prevent or reverse obesity. The control of food intake and energy expenditure, hence the regulation of energy balance, is assured by interconnected neurons of various brain regions, which include the hypothalamus ( Morton et al., 2006, Schwartz et al., 2000, Richard, 2015 ). Among all the hypothalamic nuclei, the arcuate nucleus ( ARC ), which hosts proopiomelanocortin ( POMC ) and agouti-related peptide ( AgRP ) / neuropeptide ( NPY ) - producing neurons, has emerged as a prominent structure in the control of both food intake and energy expenditure ( Krashes et al., 2013, Mayer and Belsham, 2009, Luquet et al., 2005, Gropp et al., 2005 ). POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons are major constituents of the melanocortin system, which is recognized to genuinely govern energy balance regulation ( Adan et al., 2006, Butler, 2006, Cone, 2006, De Jonghe et al., 2011, Ellacott and Cone, 2006, Xu et al., 2011 ). POMC neurons release \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( \u03b1-MSH ), which induces hypophagic and thermogenic effects, mainly through the stimulation of the melanocortin-4 receptor ( MC4R ) ( Adan et al., 2006, Butler, 2006, Cone, 2006 ). AgRP has been described as an inverse ( Chai et al., 2003, Haskell-Luevano and Monck, 2001 ) or biased ( Buch et al., 2009 ) agonist of this receptor. In this context, the understanding of the mechanisms whereby the melanocortin regulate energy homeostasis is critical to unravel the \u201cphysiopathology\u201d of obesity. Evidence has accumulated in recent years, which suggests that endozepines ( EZs ) could play a role in the regulation of energy balance. EZs are described as glial endogenous peptides ( Tonon et al., 1990 ), which are derived from the diazepam-binding inhibitor/Acyl-CoA binding protein ( Dbi/Acbp ) gene ( Mogensen et al., 1987, Ferrero et al., 1984, Corda et al., 1984 ), and which include DBI/ACBP itself, the triakontatetraneuropeptide ( TTN ) and the octadecaneuropeptide ( ODN ). EZs were initially characterized for their ability to displace benzodiazepines from their binding sites ( i. e. the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor ( GABAA-R ) and the translocator protein ( TSPO ) ( Ferrero et al., 1984, Slobodyansky et al., 1989 ). Recently, ODN emerged as endogenous modulator of the brain melanocortin signalling pathway and as a potential actor in the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis ( Lanfray et al., 2013 ), by acting via an uncharacterized G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) ( do Rego et al., 2007 ). Further supporting the role of Dbi/Acbp products in energy balance, a study conducted in humans by Comuzzie and collaborators ( Comuzzie et al., 2012 ), indicates that DBI/ACBP single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) was associated with obesity, supporting the relevance of the DBI/ACBP production in energy homeostasis. Interestingly, Comuzzie and collaborators ( Comuzzie et al., 2012 ) also identified a SNP in a well-conserved paralog gene of the DBI/ACBP, referred as Acyl-CoA binding domain containing 7 ( ACBD7 ), as associated to obesity in humans ( Comuzzie et al., 2012 ), suggesting that ACBD7 could be involved in energy homeostasis through encoding products related to EZs. The present study aimed at investigating the role of Acbd7 in energy homeostasis in mice. We hypothesised a role for Acbd7 and its encoded products in the control of energy intake and energy expenditure through modulating the networks genuinely involved in energy homeostasis, including the leptin-melanocortin circuit.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Obesity is an increasingly common problem worldwide. To treat it effectively, we must understand how the body controls how much food a person consumes and how much energy they expend. The hypothalamus is one region of the brain that plays a critical role in regulating this energy balance. Some of the neurons in the hypothalamus can change their activity when they detect satiety hormones including the leptin, which is produced by fat cells and suppresses appetite. However, it is not clear exactly how the neurons respond to leptin and other energy-related signals. Recent studies have linked the gene that encodes a protein called ACBD7 with obesity, and showed that it is one of the genes that is overexpressed in neurons that are sensitive to leptin. Now, Lanfray et al. have discovered a population of neurons that produce a new variant of the protein in the hypothalamus of mice. When this protein variant matures, it can be cut down to form a small protein-like molecule called NDN. Further experiments showed that leptin stimulates the production of both the new ABCD7 variant and NDN. Lanfray et al. then injected mice that had been denied food for a several hours with NDN. The injected mice ate less than untreated mice, and burn more energy. NDN appears to form part of the signaling pathway through which leptin signals to the hypothalamus to control appetite. In the future, creating mice in which the activity of the gene that encodes ACBD7 can be easily disrupted could help to reveal more about how the hypothalamus helps to control energy balance ."}

We analyzed the contribution of type I and type III interferon ( IFN ) using a mouse model in which the virus is selectively administered to the upper airways, mimicking a natural respiratory virus infection. Mice lacking functional IFN-\u03bb receptors ( Ifnlr1\u2212/\u2212 ) no longer restricted virus dissemination from the upper airways to the lungs. Ifnlr1\u2212/\u2212 mice shed significantly more infectious virus particles via the nostrils and transmitted the virus much more efficiently to na\u00efve contacts compared with wild-type mice or mice lacking functional type I IFN receptors. Prophylactic treatment with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb inhibited initial virus replication in all parts of the respiratory tract, but only IFN-\u03bb conferred long-lasting antiviral protection in the upper airways and blocked virus transmission. Thus, IFN-\u03bb has a decisive and non-redundant function in the upper airways that greatly limits transmission of respiratory viruses to na\u00efve contacts.  Influenza and other respiratory viruses are readily transmitted in community settings. The resulting infection chains and concomitant diseases represent an enormous economic and public health burden ( Osterhaus et al., 2015 ). At present, it is largely unknown if and how the innate immune response influences virus transmission efficacy. However, a better understanding of this issue is likely to lead to new therapeutic strategies that reduce viral transmission from infected individuals to na\u00efve contacts. Type I and type III interferon ( IFN ) are virus-induced cytokines that potently restrict viral replication during the first days of infection before activation of the adaptive immune system occurs ( Lazear et al., 2015; Wack et al., 2015 ). The type I IFN family consists of several IFN-\u03b1 subtypes, a single IFN-\u03b2 and several minor family members that all bind to and act via the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor complex ( IFNAR ), which is expressed on most nucleated cells ( Lazear et al., 2015; Wack et al., 2015 ) with the possible exception of intestinal epithelial cells ( Lin et al., 2016; Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015 ). The members of the type III IFN family ( IFN-\u03bb ) bind to a different receptor complex ( IFN-\u03bb receptor; IFNLR ), which is highly expressed on epithelial cells ( Kotenko et al., 2003; Lazear et al., 2015; Sheppard et al., 2003; Sommereyns et al., 2008; Wack et al., 2015 ) and neutrophils ( Blazek et al., 2015; Broggi et al., 2017; Espinosa et al., 2017; Galani et al., 2017 ). Transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses is traditionally studied in ferrets and occasionally in guinea pigs ( Bouvier, 2015 ). In contrast to mice, these animals are not readily accessible to genetic manipulation, and the role of IFN and IFN-regulated host restriction factors is not easily dissected. A recent report provided evidence that the mouse represents a good alternative animal model for studying influenza virus transmission, as long as suitable virus strains are employed ( Edenborough et al., 2012; Ivinson et al., 2017 ). Influenza virus replication is strongly restricted by IFN-regulated Mx genes ( Haller et al., 2015 ). Since most standard inbred mouse strains carry defective Mx alleles ( Haller et al., 2015 ), the full magnitude of influenza virus restriction by the IFN system only becomes apparent when mouse strains carrying functional Mx1 alleles derived from wild mice are employed ( Haller et al., 2015 ). We previously introduced defective alleles of the type I IFN receptor \u03b1 chain ( Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 ) or the IFN-\u03bb receptor one chain ( Ifnlr1\u2212/\u2212 ) into Mx1-competent C57BL/6 mice and thereby generated a set of mouse lines that carry functional Mx1 alleles but differ in their ability to respond to type I IFN and IFN-\u03bb ( Mordstein et al., 2008 ). Using these knockout mouse strains we demonstrated that type I IFN plays a prominent role in the defense against respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus, whereas protection mediated by IFN-\u03bb was surprisingly small ( Mordstein et al., 2010b ). In contrast, the protective role of IFN-\u03bb during viral infections of the small intestine was found to be far more pronounced than that of type I IFN ( Baldridge et al., 2017; Baldridge et al., 2015; Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015; Nice et al., 2015; Pott et al., 2011 ). This suggested either that ( i ) the gut and the respiratory tract use fundamentally different antiviral defense strategies or ( ii ) IFN-\u03bb is important in both organ systems but its beneficial role in the respiratory tract cannot be demonstrated easily due to experimental limitations. Recent work with influenza virus-infected mice ( Galani et al., 2017 ) indicated that IFN-\u03bb is produced more quickly than type I IFN, suggesting that IFN-\u03bb plays a non-redundant role in suppressing early virus growth in the respiratory tract. Nevertheless, protective effects of IFN-\u03bb were observed only if very low infection doses were used, presumably because mice with defective Mx1 alleles were employed for these studies. Furthermore, the important question whether IFN-\u03bb might play a role in restricting transmission of respiratory viruses from infected animals to na\u00efve contacts was not addressed. According to standard protocols for experimental influenza virus infections, the virus is delivered intranasally to anesthetized mice in a 40\u201350 \u00b5l volume, allowing immediate infection of the entire respiratory tract. This experimental setup might override the natural barrier function of the nasal mucosa by allowing the infection to artificially initiate in the lower respiratory tract ( Ivinson et al., 2017 ). In this study, we applied an infection protocol that guarantees a selective delivery of the virus inoculum to the upper respiratory tract, thus more closely mimicking the natural course of infection. Under such experimental conditions, virus transmission to na\u00efve contacts as well as virus spread from the upper airways to the lower respiratory tract was inhibited far more efficiently by IFN-\u03bb than by type I IFN. Interestingly, the antiviral effect induced by type I IFN in the upper airways was more transient than that of IFN-\u03bb, while no such difference was observed in the lungs. Furthermore, a small number of epithelial cells in the proximal upper respiratory tract failed to respond sufficiently to type I IFN but did respond to IFN-\u03bb. These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for the superior role of IFN-\u03bb in the upper airways.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Influenza ( \u2018the flu\u2019 ) and other respiratory viruses make millions of people ill every year, placing a large burden on the healthcare system and the economy. Unfortunately, few options for preventing or treating these infections currently exist. The flu virus spreads from infected individuals, enters a new host through the nose and establishes an infection in the upper airways. If the infection stays restricted to this region of the respiratory tract \u2013 which consists of the nasal cavity, sinuses, throat and larynx \u2013 it causes a rather mild disease. However, if it spreads to the lungs it can cause potentially life-threatening viral pneumonia. Epithelial cells line the upper respiratory tract, forming a physical border between the outside world and the human body. These cells are therefore the first to face the incoming virus. In response, the epithelial cells release messenger molecules termed interferons that warn nearby cells to increase their antiviral defenses. There are several subtypes of interferons, such as IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb, but it was not known how each subtype helps to combat respiratory viruses. To investigate, Klinkhammer, Schnepf et al. exposed mice to flu viruses in a way that mimicked how an infection would naturally start in the upper airways in humans. Some of the mice were genetically engineered so that they could not respond to either IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 or IFN-\u03bb. The virus spread most effectively from the nasal cavity to the lungs in mice whose IFN-\u03bb system was defective. Infections in mice that lacked IFN-\u03bb were also more likely to spread to other individuals. Furthermore, treating mice with IFN-\u03bb, but not IFN-\u03b1, gave their upper respiratory tract long-lasting protection against flu infections and prevented the spread of the virus. IFN-\u03bb therefore has a specific and significant role in protecting the upper airways against viruses, and could potentially be used as a drug to block the spread of infections between humans. Currently, IFN-\u03bb is in clinical trials as a potential treatment for hepatitis D. To repurpose it for upper respiratory tract infections, its effectiveness against specific respiratory viruses will first have to be evaluated ."}

Although inhibitors targeting the membrane protein Smoothened suppress Hh signaling, acquired drug resistance and tumor relapse call for additional therapeutic targets. Here we show that phosphodiesterase 4D ( PDE4D ) acts downstream of Neuropilins to control Hh transduction and medulloblastoma growth. PDE4D interacts directly with Neuropilins, positive regulators of Hh pathway. The Neuropilin ligand Semaphorin3 enhances this interaction, promoting PDE4D translocation to the plasma membrane and cAMP degradation. The consequent inhibition of protein kinase A ( PKA ) enhances Hh transduction. In the developing cerebellum, genetic removal of Neuropilins reduces Hh signaling activity and suppresses proliferation of granule neuron precursors. In mouse medulloblastoma allografts, PDE4D inhibitors suppress Hh transduction and inhibit tumor growth. Our findings reveal a new regulatory mechanism of Hh transduction, and highlight PDE4D as a promising target to treat Hh-related tumors.  The Hedgehog ( Hh ) pathway is essential in the morphogenesis and patterning of many tissues ( Briscoe and Therond, 2013 ). Hh signaling is transduced through a series of negative regulatory interactions. Binding of a Hh ligand such as Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) to its receptor Patched ( Ptch ) releases Ptch inhibition of Smoothened ( Smo ). Activated Smo then triggers a signaling cascade that eventually activates Gli transcription factors, which enable Hh target gene transcription ( Briscoe and Therond, 2013 ). Abnormalities in Hh signaling are responsible for certain birth defects and contribute to a wide range of tumors, including medulloblastoma ( MB ), the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor ( Taylor et al., 2012 ). For example, the loss of the negative regulator Ptch, causes Smo to be inappropriately active, and this leads to skin cancer and MB ( Johnson et al., 1996; Stone et al., 1996 ). Current treatment for MB, surgical removal followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, cures about 2-thirds of patients, but often leaves survivors suffering from devastating neurocognitive consequences ( Fouladi et al., 2005 ). The Smo inhibitor, vismodegib, is the only FDA-approved drug that targets the Hh pathway. However, the effect of vismodegib tends to be transient, and irreversible drug resistance and tumor relapse often ensue ( Rudin et al., 2009; Yauch et al., 2009 ). Genomic sequencing results showed that the resistance is due to mutations in Smo that reduce its binding affinity to vismodegib, or cause Smo to be constitutively active in tumor cells. Thus novel drug targets downstream of Smo are critically needed. We previously discovered that Neuropilins ( Nrp1&2 ) positively regulate Hh transduction downstream of Smo ( Hillman et al., 2011 ). Nrps are co-receptors for Semaphorin 3 ( Sema3 ) in axon guidance ( Gu et al., 2002; Appleton et al., 2007 ), and for VEGF that controls cardiovascular development and angiogenesis ( Pellet-Many et al., 2008 ). Nrps are also widely involved in many types of cancers. In particular, they are implicated in the growth and spread of MB ( Hayden Gephart et al., 2013; Snuderl et al., 2013 ). However, how Nrps regulate Hh transduction at the molecular level remains unknown, which limits our understanding of developmental signal integration and hampers the development of Nrp-related therapeutics for Hh-related tumors. MB results from the over-proliferation of granule neuron precursors ( GNPs ) in the developing cerebellum. GNP proliferation during normal development is stimulated by Hh signaling. Shh released by Purkinje neurons acts as a mitogen for GNPs ( Dahmane and Ruiz i Altaba, 1999; Wallace, 1999; Wechsler-Reya and Scott, 1999 ). Activating mutations in the Hh pathway are responsible for about one-quarter of MB cases. Nrp1 and Nrp2 are highly expressed in developing cerebellum and in human MBs ( Snuderl et al., 2013 ). One way that Nrps can affect tumor growth is by facilitating VEGF-driven vascularization events that prevent tumor suffocation. However, several lines of evidence suggest that Nrps promote tumor growth through mechanisms in addition to VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Abolishing Nrp function in tumor cells using function-blocking antibodies suffices to suppress MB growth and metastasis ( Snuderl et al., 2013 ). Selective inhibition of Nrp function by RNAi specifically in MB tumor cells, that is not in vasculature, blocks growth of MB allografts ( Hayden Gephart et al., 2013 ). However, despite extensive research on each pathway, it remains unclear whether and how Nrps interact with Hh pathways to control GNP proliferation and MB formation. Here we describe a molecular mechanism that integrates Sema3/Nrp signaling with Hh transduction. We found that Sema3, a member of a secreted ligand family, enhances Hh signaling. This is achieved by activation of Phosphodiesterase 4D ( PDE4D ), which reduces intracellular cAMP levels through hydrolysis. The subsequent inhibition of Protein Kinase A ( PKA ) activity promotes Hh transduction. We demonstrate that this molecular interplay operates in the developing cerebellum. Genetic removal of Sema3/Nrp signaling severely impairs GNP proliferation. Furthermore, inhibiting PDE4D suppresses the growth of Hh-related MB. These findings reveal a hitherto unknown transduction mechanism that links Sema3/Nrp signaling with Hh pathway, 2 major pathways in development and disease, and highlight PDE4D as a new therapeutic target for Hh-related tumors.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: A communication system in cells called the Hedgehog signaling pathway plays an essential role in the formation of tissues and organs in animal embryos. The activity of the pathway is carefully controlled during development and if Hedgehog signaling is disrupted it can lead to developmental defects and particular types of cancer. Some of these cancers can be treated with a drug called vismodegib, which targets a particular molecule in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. However, tumor cells can become resistant to this drug, so researchers are hoping to find new therapies that target other aspects of the signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling promotes the division of brain cells called granule neuron precursor cells ( or GNP cells for short ). If the signaling pathway is over-active it can trigger the GNP cells to divide more than they should. This can lead to medulloblastoma, which is the most common type of brain tumor that affects children. Proteins called Neuropilins\u2014which bind to molecules known as Semaphorins\u2014promote Hedgehog signaling and the formation of medulloblastoma, but it was not clear how this works. Here Ge et al. studied the role of Neuropilin in cultured cells and in the cerebellum of mice. The experiments show that Semaphorin 3 promotes the accumulation of an enzyme called PDE4D at the cell membrane. PDE4D interacts with Neuropilin and blocks the activity of another enzyme that normally inhibits Hedgehog signaling. In mice that lack Neuropilin and Semophorin 3, the GNP cells are less able to divide, which leads to abnormal development of the cerebellum. Further experiments show that drugs that target PDE4D inhibit both the Hedgehog pathway and the growth of tumors that are resistant to vismodegib treatment. Ge et al. 's findings uncover a new way in which Hedgehog signaling is regulated and highlight a potential new strategy for treating medulloblastoma and other similar tumors. Current PDE4D inhibitors are associated with severe side effects, so the next challenge is to develop new drugs that have fewer side effects ."}

To understand how temporal input information is encoded and decoded by the NF-\u03baB system, we studied transcription factor dynamics and gene regulation under dose- and duration-modulated inflammatory inputs. Mathematical modeling predicted and microfluidic single-cell experiments confirmed that integral of the stimulus ( or area, concentration \u00d7 duration ) controls the fraction of cells that activate NF-\u03baB in the population. However, stimulus temporal profile determined NF-\u03baB dynamics, cell-to-cell variability, and gene expression phenotype. A sustained, weak stimulation lead to heterogeneous activation and delayed timing that is transmitted to gene expression. In contrast, a transient, strong stimulus with the same area caused rapid and uniform dynamics. These results show that digital NF-\u03baB signaling enables multidimensional control of cellular phenotype via input profile, allowing parallel and independent control of single-cell activation probability and population heterogeneity.  Cells must make decisions in noisy environments and have to decrease the chance of an errant response. One way cells can reduce sensitivity to noise is through digital or switch-like activation, such that only sufficiently strong signal exceeds an internal threshold and initiates a response. Switch-like activation occurs through diverse mechanisms ( Shah and Sarkar, 2011 ). For example, observations in Xenopus oocytes showed that the MAPK pathway converted graded progesterone input to digital output in p42 MAPK that determined oocyte maturation ( Petty et al., 1998 ). Subsequently, similar observations were seen for the JNK pathway ( Bagowski and Ferrell, 2001 ). The scaffolding protein Spe5 was found to mediate digital MAPK activation of mating in yeast ( Malleshaiah et al., 2010 ). More recently, it was found that inflammasome signaling leads to all-or-none caspase1 activation that mediates apoptosis ( Liu et al., 2013 ). Both amplitude ( dose ) and duration of input signals provide information that regulates cellular decisions. The duration of Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) stimulation modulates ERK dynamics and controls differentiation ( Santos et al., 2007; von Kriegsheim et al., 2009; Ahmed et al., 2014 ). Glucose sensing in plants showed that cells have gene regulatory network mechanisms to allow similar responses to a short, intense or sustained, moderate stimulus ( Fu et al., 2014 ). Lymphocytes must precisely measure both antigen affinity and frequency to decide differentiation and proliferation ( Iezzi et al., 1998; Gottschalk et al., 2012; Miskov-Zivanov et al., 2013 ). Although digital pathway activation allows robust cellular decision across a wide range of systems, it is not clear how digital signaling impacts processing of dose and duration information. NF-\u03baB is a critical regulator of phenotype in immunity and disease ( Hayden and Ghosh, 2008 ) and responds digitally to Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) stimulation ( Tay et al., 2010; Turner et al., 2010 ). NF-\u03baB activation occurs for a multitude of cell stress and inflammatory signals that converge on the IKK ( I\u03baB Kinase ) signaling hub, which induces degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor I\u03baB and liberates NF-\u03baB to enter the nucleus and regulate gene expression ( Hayden and Ghosh, 2008 ). Multi-layered negative and positive feedback lead to complex pathway dynamics including oscillations ( Hoffmann et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2004; Tay et al., 2010; Kellogg and Tay, 2015 ). Although it is not fully resolved how NF-\u03baB coordinates gene and phenotype regulation, it is known that dynamic NF-\u03baB activation is involved in input\u2013output specificity and information transmission ( Werner et al., 2005; Ashall et al., 2009; Behar and Hoffmann, 2013; Selimkhanov et al., 2014 ). The core I\u03baB-NF-\u03baB regulatory module is well-studied and appears largely consistent across multiple stimulation contexts ( Hoffmann et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2004; Tay et al., 2010; Hughey et al., 2014 ) ; however, the role of module upstream of IKK activation including receptor-ligand binding and adaptor protein assembly in input-encoding remains unclear. To probe how diverse IKK-upstream signaling architectures impact NF-\u03baB processing of pathogen- and host-associated inflammatory inputs, we used microfluidic cell culture to precisely modulate dose and duration of LPS and TNF stimuli and measured NF-\u03baB dynamics using live cell imaging ( Figure 1 ) ( Junkin and Tay, 2014; Kellogg et al., 2014 ). We found that lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces NF-\u03baB activation in a digital way where cells respond in an all-or-none fashion, but in a distinct manner from TNF, with greater ultrasensitivity and pronounced input-dependent activation delay. Computational modeling predicted and experiments confirmed that LPS integral over the stimulus or \u2018area\u2019 ( concentration \u00d7 duration ) controls the percentage of cells that activate in the population. Importantly, dynamics of NF-\u03baB activation depend on input temporal profile, so that a long duration, low-dose ( LL ) signal induces delayed, heterogeneous activation timing in the population while a short duration, strong amplitude ( SS ) signal with the same area causes rapid activation without cell-to-cell timing variability ( Figure 1 ). These results reveal a function for digital signaling beyond simple noise filtering: digital activation controls fate along a two dimensional space by allowing an input signal to independently control the population response ( percentage of responding cells ) and single-cell response ( transcription factor dynamics and gene expression phenotype ) though modulation of signal area and shape. 10. 7554/eLife. 08931. 003Figure 1. How does input profile determine digital signaling response ? Since the amplitude and time profile of input signals depends on biological context, such as distance to an infection site or pathogen loading, we use microfluidics to manipulate dose ( A ) and duration ( B ) of LPS and TNF input signals, which induces digital activation of NF-\u03baB. ( C ) Switch-like digital NF-\u03baB responses are analyzed in terms of fraction of cells that activate in the population and heterogeneity in the dynamic responses in activating cells. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 08931. 003  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells have communication systems called signaling pathways that enable them to detect and respond to changes in their surrounding environment. For example, in humans and other animals, a signaling pathway called NF-\u03baB signaling is part of the immune system and regulates the inflammation that is caused by damage to cells, or by an invading microbe. Several signal molecules, including a protein called TNF\u2014which is released by cells during an immune response\u2014activate NF-\u03baB signaling. However, the levels of TNF in the environment around a cell may fluctuate randomly even when there is no immune response. Therefore, the NF-\u03baB pathway needs to be able to tell the difference between this \u2018noise\u2019 and a large increase in TNF associated with an immune response. To get around this problem, many signaling pathways are activated in a switch-like manner so that only a strong signal that exceeds a particular threshold will lead to a response. These so called \u2018digital\u2019 responses help cells to filter out noise caused by random fluctuations in the amount of a signal molecule. NF-\u03baB signaling responds to TNF in a digital manner, but it is not clear how information about the length of the signal can influence the degree to which NF-\u03baB signaling is activated. Kellogg et al. used a combination of mathematical modeling and microscopy techniques to study the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling in mouse cells. The study shows that a molecule called LPS\u2014which is produced by microbes known as bacteria\u2014can also switch on the signaling pathway in a digital manner, but in a different way to TNF. In a population of cells, the fraction that activate NF-\u03baB signaling in response to LPS or another signal is determined by the level of the signal ( also known as its \u2018concentration\u2019 ) multiplied by the signal's duration. This is known as the signal's \u2018area\u2019. On the other hand, the way that these cells respond to the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling depends on the nature of the activity produced by the signal pathway. For example, a short but strong burst of LPS signal leads to rapid and uniform responses in the cells. A weaker but longer lasting signaling activity leads to slower, more varied responses in cells. These findings reveal that such switch-like, digital responses do more than just filter out noisy signals. They can also integrate information about the timing and intensity of the signal to independently control different aspects of cell responses. The next challenge will be to extend this understanding to more complex scenarios, such as when signals contain several types of molecules at the same time ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe tumor suppressor protein Scribble ( SCRIB ) plays an evolutionary conserved role in cell polarity. Despite being central for its function, the molecular basis of SCRIB recruitment and stabilization at the cell cortex is poorly understood. Here we show that SCRIB binds directly to the CH1 domain of \u03b2 spectrins, a molecular scaffold that contributes to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and connects it to the plasma membrane. We have identified a short evolutionary conserved peptide motif named SADH motif ( SCRIB ABLIMs DMTN Homology ) which is necessary and sufficient to mediate protein interaction with \u03b2 spectrins. The SADH domains contribute to SCRIB dynamics at the cell cortex and SCRIB polarity function. Furthermore, mutations in SCRIB SADH domains associated with spina bifida and cancer impact the stability of SCRIB at the plasma membrane, suggesting that SADH domain alterations may participate in human pathology.  The protein SCRIB has been implicated in a staggering array of cellular processes including polarity, migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, stemcell maintenance, and vesicle trafficking ( Humbert et al., 2008 ). SCRIB is a membrane associated protein localizing at cell junctions ( Navarro et al., 2005; Qin et al., 2005 ). Alteration of SCRIB localization at the membrane often mimics SCRIB loss-of-function phenotype ( Zhan et al., 2008; Cordenonsi et al., 2011; Elsum and Humbert, 2013 ) and SCRIB aberrant accumulation in the cytosol strongly correlates with poor survival in human cancers ( Nakagawa et al., 2004; Navarro et al., 2005; Gardiol et al., 2006; Kamei et al., 2007; Ouyang et al., 2010; Pearson et al., 2011; Feigin et al., 2014 ). Despite the crucial importance of SCRIB subcellular localization, the molecular basis of SCRIB recruitment and stabilization to the cell cortex is not fully understood. SCRIB has a tripartite domain organization that consists of an N-terminal region composed of leucine-rich repeats ( LRR ), PDZ domains and a C-terminal region with no identified protein domain. While the LRR region is crucial for membrane targeting ( Legouis et al., 2003; Zarbalis et al., 2004; Zeitler et al., 2004 ), mutations affecting the PDZ and C-terminal regions have also been reported to affect SCRIB subcellular localization ( Robinson et al., 2011; Lei et al., 2013 ). The LRR and PDZ domains are highly conserved between Drosophila and human ( 60% of homology ). The C-terminal region displays a poor conservation between the two species ( 13% ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and its function remains unclear. This is surprising considering that about 40% ( 5/12 ) of all the pathological germline mutations identified in the mouse and human Scrib/SCRIB genes lies within the C-terminal domain of the protein ( Murdoch et al., 2003; Zarbalis et al., 2004; Wansleeben et al., 2010; Stottmann et al., 2011; Lei et al., 2013 ). Here we show that the C-terminal part of SCRIB contains three spectrin binding motifs which are crucial for SCRIB cortical dynamics and polarity function.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Proteins found in cells often have more than one role. Scribble is one such multi-tasking protein that is found in a diverse range of species, including fruit flies and humans. Although Scribble commonly helps to ensure that the components of a cell are in their correct locations, its exact roles vary between species. To perform its role well, Scribble itself must localize to the cell cortex\u2014the inside surface of the cell membrane\u2014at the regions where cells connect to one another. How this localization occurs is not fully understood; and defects in the human form of Scribble have been linked to diseases including spina bifida and cancer. Much of the Scribble protein is very similar across different species, but the fruit fly and human version of the protein have large differences in their \u2018C-terminal region\u2019 that makes up one end of each protein. Bo\u00ebda and Etienne-Manneville now show that in humans and other animals with backbones\u2014but not in fruit flies\u2014the C-terminal region of Scribble contains three repeats of a sequence called the SADH motif. These motifs can bind to proteins called beta spectrins, which connect the cell's outer membrane to the scaffolding-like structure inside the cell that provides support. Mutations that alter the SADH motif interfere with Scribble's ability to bind to the scaffolding, and alters Scribble localization at cell\u2013cell contacts or the cell cortex. Bo\u00ebda and Etienne-Manneville also found that some mutations linked to spina bifida and cancer affect the SADH motif, suggesting that this motif has a wider role in disease. While the abnormal localization of Scribble inside cells is frequently observed in particularly difficult to survive cancers, the molecular mechanism that causes Scribble to fail to localize to the cell periphery is still poorly understood. Bo\u00ebda and Etienne-Manneville's work establishes the beta spectrin family of proteins as regulators that stabilize Scribble at the cell cortex and suggests that Scribble-associated diseases might depend on the integrity of the spectrin network ."}

We present novel experiments in which two micropipette-held somatic cells of Volvox carteri, with distinct intrinsic beating frequencies, are studied by high-speed imaging as a function of their separation and orientation. Analysis of time series shows that the interflagellar coupling, constrained by lack of connections between cells to be hydrodynamical, exhibits a spatial dependence consistent with theory. At close spacings it produces robust synchrony for thousands of beats, while at increasing separations synchrony is degraded by stochastic processes. Manipulation of the relative flagellar orientation reveals in-phase and antiphase states, consistent with dynamical theories. Flagellar tracking with exquisite precision reveals waveform changes that result from hydrodynamic coupling. This study proves unequivocally that flagella coupled solely through a fluid can achieve robust synchrony despite differences in their intrinsic properties.  Despite the elegance and apparent simplicity of the eukaryotic flagellum and its shorter ciliary version, the collective motions exhibited by groups of these organelles and the resultant fluid flows are far from trivial. For example, the unicellular biflagellate alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii executes diffusive \u2018run-and-turn\u2019 locomotion ( Goldstein et al., 2009; Polin et al., 2009 ) through stochastic switching between synchronized and unsynchronized swimming gaits\u2014a process which could enhance searching efficiency and assist in the avoidance of predators ( Stocker and Durham, 2009 ). Ensembles of cilia and flagella exhibit stunning temporal coordination, generating flows that transport mucus and expel pathogens ( Button et al., 2012 ), establish the left-right asymmetry in developing mammalian embryos ( Nonaka et al., 2002 ), and transport ova in human fallopian tubes ( Lyons et al., 2006 ). The origin of flagellar synchronization has been the subject of intense theoretical investigation for many decades. One of the earliest experimental results was Rothschild's qualitative observation ( Rothschild, 1949 ) that the flagella of bull spermatozoa tend to synchronize when they swim close to one another, coupled only through the fluid surrounding them. Much more recent observations of self-organised vortex arrays of swimming sea urchin spermatazoa near surfaces ( Riedel et al., 2005 ) provide further evidence for synchrony mediated purely by hydrodynamic coupling. Motivated by Rothschild's observation, Taylor ( Taylor, 1951 ) developed a mathematical model in which two laterally infinite, inextensible sheets with prescribed sinusoidal travelling waves of transverse deformation interact with each other through a viscous fluid. He found that the rate of viscous dissipation is minimised when the two sheets are in phase. While minimisation of dissipation often holds in real physical systems, it is not in general a fundamental principle from which to deduce dynamical processes. Rather, an explanation for synchronization should capture the forces and torques associated with the underlying molecular motors that drive flagella, their elasticity, as well as the viscosity of the surrounding fluid. Since Taylor's work a myriad of increasingly complex models of flagellar synchronization have been proposed. Hydrodynamically coupled filaments or chains with various internal driving forces exhibit a general tendency towards synchrony ( Machin, 1963; Gueron et al., 1997; Guirao and Joanny, 2007; Yang et al., 2008; Elgeti and Gompper, 2013 ). At the same time, minimal models of coupled oscillators in viscous fluids ( Vilfan and J\u00fclicher, 2006; Niedermayer et al., 2008; Uchida and Golestanian, 2011, 2012; Brumley et al., 2012 ) offer great insight into the emergence of metachronal coordination. Such models have been investigated experimentally with light driven microrotors ( Di Leonardo et al., 2012 ), rotating paddles ( Qian et al., 2009 ) and colloids in optical tweezers ( Kotar et al., 2010 ), and have also given rise to interpretations of the synchrony and coupling interactions between pairs of flagella of the model alga Chlamydomonas ( Goldstein et al., 2009 ). Although experimentally-derived coupling strengths between micropipette-held Chlamydomonas flagella are consistent with predictions based on direct hydrodynamic coupling ( Goldstein et al., 2011 ), it has been proposed ( Friedrich and J\u00fclicher, 2012; Geyer et al., 2013 ) instead that this coupling is too weak to overcome noise, and that residual motion of elastically-clamped cells could play a role in synchronization. The recent observation ( Leptos et al., 2013 ) of antiphase synchronization in a non-phototactic mutant of Chlamydomonas points as well to the possible role of internal mechanical coupling between flagella. Clearly, examining the synchronization between flagella on a single cell it is difficult to establish with certainty the origins of the coupling mechanism due to the likely presence of biochemical and elastic couplings of as yet unquantified strength between flagella. In order to disentangle the hydrodynamic from the intracellular contributions to flagellar synchronization we conducted a series of experiments in which two physically separated flagellated cells, which exhibit distinct intrinsic beating frequencies in isolation, are coupled solely and directly through the surrounding fluid. These experiments can be viewed as natural generalisations of earlier work in which vibrating microneedles ( Okuno and Hiramoto, 1976 ) or micropipettes ( Eshel and Gibbons, 1989 ) are used to modulate and entrain the beating of a single sperm flagellum. Owing to the natural distribution of beating frequencies of the flagella of its surface somatic cells, the colonial alga Volvox carteri is ideally suited to this purpose. Each somatic cell possesses two flagella which beat in perfect synchrony, facilitating their treatment as a single entity, henceforth referred to as the flagellum. Somatic cells were isolated from adult Volvox colonies and held with micropipettes at a controllable separation d ( Figure 1A, B ). The spatial and orientational degrees of freedom associated with this configuration enabled comprehensive analysis over a wide range of hydrodynamic coupling strengths. We found that closely-separated pairs of cells can exhibit robust phase-locking for thousands of beats at a time, despite a discrepancy in their intrinsic frequencies of as much as 10%. Both in-phase and antiphase configurations were observed, depending on the alignment of the directions of flagellar propulsion. Furthermore, with increasing interflagellar spacing we observed for each flagellum a marked change in the beating waveform, a key finding that lends support to models of synchronization that rely on waveform compliance to achieve phase-locking. 10. 7554/eLife. 02750. 003Figure 1.

Similar, shorter structures called cilia are also found on the surface of many cells, where they perform roles such as moving liquids over the cell. Each cilium or flagellum beats at its own characteristic rhythm, but there are many situations where cilia or flagella must synchronize their beating with other nearby cells. For example, an egg cell is swept along the Fallopian tube by the coordinated beating of the cilia lining the tube. Bull sperm cells are also known to synchronize the beating of their flagella when swimming close to each other. It has been suggested that the movement of the fluid surrounding the beating flagella could be the source of this synchronization. Experiments have produced results that match up with mathematical models describing this fluid movement. However, these experiments have often been designed in ways that didn\u2019t fully exclude other possible sources of synchronization, such as chemical signalling, or\u2014for flagella located on the same cell\u2014a physical connection between the flagella. To overcome this shortcoming, Brumley et al. used high-speed imaging to watch the flagella of cells of Volvox carteri\u2014a species of green alga\u2014that were separated so that they could only communicate through the movement of the fluid around them. The flagella were still able to synchronize their beating, even when the two flagella naturally beat at substantially different rates. The distance between the flagella affects how well the beating synchronizes. When close together, the flagella can lock into the same rhythm for thousands of beats. However, as they move further apart, random biochemical fluctuations within the cells reduce the extent to which the flagella can synchronize. The flagella can also synchronize so that they move in the same direction at the same time, or in opposite directions, depending on how they are oriented relative to each other. Moreover, the results confirm that the fluid flow produced by a beating flagellum is sufficient to synchronize the beating of other nearby flagella ."}

Mosaic expression of a membrane reporter in nascent mesoderm enabled recording cell shape and trajectory through live imaging. Upon leaving the streak, cells changed shape and extended protrusions of distinct size and abundance depending on the neighboring germ layer, as well as the region of the embryo. Embryonic trajectories were meandrous but directional, while extra-embryonic mesoderm cells showed little net displacement. Embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm transcriptomes highlighted distinct guidance, cytoskeleton, adhesion, and extracellular matrix signatures. Specifically, intermediate filaments were highly expressed in extra-embryonic mesoderm, while live imaging for F-actin showed abundance of actin filaments in embryonic mesoderm only. Accordingly, Rhoa or Rac1 conditional deletion in mesoderm inhibited embryonic, but not extra-embryonic mesoderm migration. Overall, this indicates separate cytoskeleton regulation coordinating the morphology and migration of mesoderm subpopulations.  In mice, a first separation of embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages begins in the blastocyst at embryonic day ( E ) 3. 5 when the trophectoderm is set aside from the inner cell mass. A second step is the segregation of the inner cell mass into the epiblast, the precursor of most fetal cell lineages, and the extra-embryonic primitive endoderm ( Chazaud and Yamanaka, 2016 ). At E6, the embryo is cup-shaped and its anterior-posterior axis is defined. It comprises three cell types, arranged in two layers: the inner layer is formed by epiblast, distally, and extra-embryonic ectoderm, proximally; the outer layer, visceral endoderm, covers the entire embryo surface. The primitive streak, site of gastrulation, is formed at E6. 25 in the posterior epiblast, at the junction between embryonic and extra-embryonic regions, and subsequently elongates to the distal tip of the embryo. The primitive streak is the region of the embryo where epiblast cells delaminate through epithelial-mesenchymal transition to generate a new population of mesenchymal cells that form the mesoderm and definitive endoderm layers. All mesoderm, including the extra-embryonic mesoderm, is of embryonic epiblast origin. At the onset of gastrulation, emerging mesoderm migrates either anteriorly as so-called embryonic mesodermal wings, or proximally as extra-embryonic mesoderm ( Arnold and Robertson, 2009; Sutherland, 2016 ). Cell lineages studies showed that there is little correlation between the position of mesoderm progenitors in the epiblast and the final localization of mesoderm descendants ( Lawson et al., 1991 ). Rather, the distribution of mesoderm subpopulations depends on the temporal order and anterior-posterior location of cell recruitment through the primitive streak ( Kinder et al., 1999 ). Posterior primitive streak cells are the major source of extra-embryonic mesoderm, while cells from middle and anterior primitive streak are mostly destined to the embryo proper. However, there is overlap of fates between cells delaminating at different sites and timings ( Kinder et al., 1999; Kinder et al., 2001 ). Extra-embryonic mesoderm contributes to the amnion, allantois, chorion, and visceral yolk sac. It has important functions in maternal-fetal protection and communication, as well as in primitive erythropoiesis ( Watson and Cross, 2005 ). Embryonic mesoderm separates into lateral plate, intermediate, paraxial and axial mesoderm, and ultimately gives rise to cranial and cardiac mesenchyme, blood vessels and hematopoietic progenitors, urogenital system, muscles and bones, among others. Endoderm precursors co-migrate with mesoderm progenitors in the wings and undergo a mesenchymal-epithelial transition to intercalate into the visceral endoderm ( Viotti et al., 2014 ). Mesoderm migration mechanisms have mostly been studied in fly, fish, frog and chicken embryos. During fly gastrulation, mesodermal cells migrate as a collective ( Bae et al., 2012 ). In the fish Fundulus heteroclitus, deep cells of the dorsal germ ring move as loose clusters with meandering trajectories ( Trinkaus et al., 1992 ). At mid-gastrulation, zebrafish lateral mesoderm cells are not elongated and migrate as individuals along indirect paths, while by late gastrulation, cells are more polarized and their trajectories are straighter, resulting in higher speed ( Jessen et al., 2002 ). In zebrafish prechordal plate, all cells have similar migration properties but they require contact between each other for directional migration ( Dumortier et al., 2012 ). In chick, cells migrate in a very directional manner at high density. Cells are continually in close proximity, even though they frequently make and break contacts with their neighbors ( Chuai et al., 2012 ). Relatively little is known about mesoderm migration in mice because most mutant phenotypes with mesodermal defects result from anomalies in primitive streak formation, mesoderm specification, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( Arnold and Robertson, 2009 ), precluding further insight into cell migration mechanisms. We previously identified a role for the Rho GTPase Rac1, a mediator of cytoskeletal reorganization, in mesoderm migration and adhesion ( Migeotte et al., 2011 ). Recent advances in mouse embryo culture and live imaging have overcome the challenge of maintaining adequate embryo growth and morphology while performing high-resolution imaging. It facilitated the uncovering of the precise spatial and temporal regulation of cellular processes and disclosed that inaccurate conclusions had sometimes been drawn from static analyses ( Viotti et al., 2014 ). Live imaging of mouse embryos bearing a reporter for nuclei has pointed towards individual rather than collective migration in the mesodermal wings ( Ichikawa et al., 2013 ). Very recently, a spectacular adaptive light sheet imaging approach allowed reconstructing fate maps at the single cell level from gastrulation to early organogenesis ( McDole et al., 2018 ). However, little is known about how mesoderm populations regulate their shape and migration mechanisms as they travel across distinct embryo regions to fulfill their respective fates. Here, high-resolution live imaging of nascent mesoderm expressing membrane-bound GFP was used to define the dynamics of mesoderm cell morphology and its trajectories. Mesoderm cells exhibited a variety of cell shape changes determined by their spatial localization in the embryo, and the germ layer they were in contact with. The embryonic mesoderm migration path was meandrous but directional, and depended on the Rho GTPases Rhoa and Rac1. Extra-embryonic mesoderm movement was, strikingly, GTPases independent. Transcriptomes of different mesoderm populations uncovered specific sets of guidance, adhesion, cytoskeleton and matrix components, which may underlie the remarkable differences in cell behavior between mesoderm subtypes.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: As an embryo develops, its cells divide and specialize to form different tissues and organs. Early in development the cells arrange into so-called germ layers, which each produce particular types of tissue. One of these layers, called the mesoderm, develops into the muscles, bones and circulatory system of the embryo. It also contributes to the support structures that feed and protect the embryo, such as the placenta, umbilical cord and yolk sac. If these \u2018extra-embryonic\u2019 structures do not develop correctly, the embryo may not grow properly. Much of what we know about how the cells of the mesoderm move around to form different tissues comes from studies of species that lay eggs; for example, chicks, frogs and fish. The initial steps of embryo development in these animals are similar to how mammals develop, but bigger differences emerge as the extra-embryonic tissues start to form. Recent methodological advances are now making it possible to dynamically study this later stage of development in live mouse embryos. Saykali et al. studied mouse embryos whose mesoderm cells contained a \u2018reporter\u2019 that allowed them to be identified when viewed using a microscopy technique known as two-photon live imaging. This approach allows cells to be tracked as they move through living tissue. Saykali et al. found that the mesoderm cells change shape depending on which region of the embryo they are in, and on which germ layer they are next to. The cells that become extra-embryonic are larger and longer, and develop small protrusions. Instead of moving directly to their destinations, they tend to zigzag. Further experiments revealed that embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm cells produce different amounts of several proteins, including the distinct types of filaments that act as the cell\u2019s internal skeleton. Mesoderm cells that are destined to become extra-embryonic depend less on signaling proteins called Rho GTPases to move around. Knowing how mesoderm cells form extra-embryonic structures will help researchers to understand how problems with these structures can affect how embryos grow. The techniques used by Saykali et al. will also help to design new ways to cultivate mesoderm cells in the laboratory for future experiments. These could, for example, investigate whether human mesoderm cells develop in the same way as mice mesoderm cells ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMyogenesis is an evolutionarily conserved process. Little known, however, is how the morphology of each muscle is determined, such that movements relying upon contraction of many muscles are both precise and coordinated. Each Drosophila larval muscle is a single multinucleated fibre whose morphology reflects expression of distinctive identity Transcription Factors ( iTFs ). By deleting transcription cis-regulatory modules of one iTF, Collier, we generated viable muscle identity mutants, allowing live imaging and locomotion assays. We show that both selection of muscle attachment sites and muscle/muscle matching is intrinsic to muscle identity and requires transcriptional reprogramming of syncytial nuclei. Live-imaging shows that the staggered muscle pattern involves attraction to tendon cells and heterotypic muscle-muscle adhesion. Unbalance leads to formation of branched muscles, and this correlates with locomotor behavior deficit. Thus, engineering Drosophila muscle identity mutants allows to investigate, in vivo, physiological and mechanical properties of abnormal muscles.  The musculature of each animal is composed of an array of body wall muscles allowing precision and stereotypy of movements. The somatic musculature of the Drosophila larva - about 30 distinct body wall muscles per each hemi-segment which are distributed in three layers, internal, median and external - is a model to study how a muscle pattern is specified and linked to locomotion behaviour. Each muscle is a single multinucleated fibre with a specific identity: size, shape, orientation relative to the dorso-ventral and antero-posterior body axes, motoneuron innervation and attachment sites to the exoskeleton via tendon cells located at specific positions. Intersegmental tendon cells, where a large fraction of muscles is attached, are distributed in three groups, dorsal, lateral and ventral ( Bate, 1990; Volk and VijayRaghavan, 1994; Schweitzer et al., 2010; Armand et al., 1994 ). Internal muscles also attach to muscle ( s ) in the next segment, forming \u2018indirect\u2019 muscle attachment sites ( iMAS ) ( Maartens and Brown, 2015 ). Drosophila muscle development proceeds through fusion of a founder myoblast ( founder cell, FC ) with fusion-competent myoblasts ( FCMs ) ( Deng et al., 2017 ). FCs originate from asymmetric division of progenitor cells ( PCs ) themselves selected from equivalence groups of myoblasts, called promuscular clusters ( PMCs ). Muscle identity ensues from the expression by each PC and FC of a specific combination of identity transcription factors ( iTFs ) ( de Joussineau et al., 2012 ), established in three steps: First, different iTFs are activated in different PMCs, in response to positional information, and this expression is only maintained in PCs. Second, refinement of the iTF code occurs via cross-regulations between different iTFs in PCs and/or FCs and Notch signalling ( Carmena et al., 1998; Carmena et al., 2002; Enriquez et al., 2010 ). Several PCs can be serially selected from a PMC and give rise to different muscle identities according to birth order, adding a temporal dimension to these regulations. A well-documented example is the distinction between DA2 and DA3 identities ( Figure 1A; Dubois et al., 2016; Boukhatmi et al., 2012 ). Third, transcriptional activation of iTFs in syncytial nuclei after fusion correlates with the activation of identity \u2018realisation\u2019 genes acting downstream of some iTFs ( Crozatier and Vincent, 1999; Knirr et al., 1999; Bataill\u00e9 et al., 2010; Bataill\u00e9 et al., 2017 ). The consequence of specific muscle identity defects on locomotion, a question of prime importance for progress on studying human myopathies which affect subsets of muscles, remains largely to be assessed. Genetically controlled muscle identity changes should, in principle, provide suitable models for studying locomotion deficits linked to muscle imbalance. However, mutations for known Drosophila iTFs are embryonic lethal and/or show pleiotropic phenotypes reflecting their multiple expression sites. Here, we took advantage of our previous characterisation of col expression in a single larval muscle, the DA3 muscle and of the two involved cis-regulatory modules ( CRMs ), early ( E-CRM ) and late ( L-CRM ), to generate muscle-specific mutants and circumvent lethality/pleiotropy of null mutants. CRM deletions show that E-CRM and L-CRM act redundantly at the PC stage, emphasising that PC is a key stage in specification of muscle identity. L-CRM deletion results into loss of col transcription in DA3 FCs and morphological transformation of the DA3 into a DA2-like muscle. Removal of an auto-regulatory cis-module located in L-CRM specifically abolishes col activation in syncytial nuclei fusing with the DA3 FC. This leads to incomplete DA3 transformations and the formation of bifid/branched muscles of mixed DA3/DA2 morphology. In summary, our data show that i ) the FC transcriptional program must be propagated to syncytial nuclei for a muscle to adopt a specific morphology; ii ) the precise matching of muscle/muscle attachments over the intersegmental border, which leads to a staggered rows pattern, involves a process of selective adhesion controlled by iTFs; iii ) branched muscles affect larval locomotion performance. Branched muscles are typical of late, severe phases of human Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( Chan and Head, 2011 ). Drosophila iTF CRM deletion could be an effective setting for creating muscle-specific transformations and branched muscles, as new paradigms to study myopathies specifically affecting subsets of muscles in humans.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Each muscle in the body has a unique size, shape and set of attachment points. Animals need all of their muscles to have the correct identity to help maintain posture and control movement. A specific set of proteins, called transcription factors, co-ordinate and regulate gene activity in cells so that each muscle develops in the right way. To create a muscle, multiple precursor cells fuse together to form a muscle fibre, which then elongates and attaches to specific sites. Correct attachment is critical so that the fibre is properly oriented. When this process goes wrong, for example in disease, muscle fibres sometimes attach to the wrong site; they become branched and cannot work properly. Collier is a transcription factor protein that controls muscle identity in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. However, like many transcription factors, Collier also has several other roles throughout the body. This made it difficult to evaluate the effect of the protein on the formation of specific muscles. Here, Carayon et al. managed to selectively deactivate Collier in just one muscle per body section in the larvae of fruit flies. This showed that the transcription factor is needed throughout muscle development; in particular, it is required for muscle fibres to select the correct attachment sites, and to be properly oriented. Affected muscles showed an altered orientation, with branched fibres attaching to the wrong site. Even minor changes, which only affect a single muscle from each body segment, greatly impaired the movement of the larvae. The work by Carayon et al. offers a new approach to the study of muscular conditions. Branched muscles are seen in severe human illnesses such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Studying the impact of these changes in a living animal could help to understand how this disease progress, and how it can be prevented ."}

However, the role of p53 in aging process and longevity has not been well-established. In humans, single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) with either arginine ( R72 ) or proline ( P72 ) at codon 72 influences p53 activity; the P72 allele has a weaker p53 activity and function in tumor suppression. Here, employing a mouse model with knock-in of human TP53 gene carrying codon 72 SNP, we found that despite increased cancer risk, P72 mice that escape tumor development display a longer lifespan than R72 mice. Further, P72 mice have a delayed development of aging-associated phenotypes compared with R72 mice. Mechanistically, P72 mice can better retain the self-renewal function of stem/progenitor cells compared with R72 mice during aging. This study provides direct genetic evidence demonstrating that p53 codon 72 SNP directly impacts aging and longevity, which supports a role of p53 in regulation of longevity.  Aging is a complex process of time-dependent series of progressive loss of functions and structures of all systems, which leads to an increased vulnerability to death ( L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al., 2013 ). Cancer is an age-associated disease, which can lead to both premature death and age-associated increase in morbidity and mortality ( Campisi and Yaswen, 2009 ). Tumor suppressor p53 plays a pivotal role in tumor prevention ( Feng et al., 2008; Vousden and Prives, 2009 ). Loss or disruption of p53 function is often a prerequisite for tumor initiation and development. In humans, more than 50% of all human tumors contain mutations in the p53 gene ( Olivier et al., 2002 ). In mice, loss of both Trp53 alleles ( p53-/- ) leads to the development of tumors early in life and a reduced lifespan compared with wild type mice ( Donehower et al., 1992 ). Therefore, p53 ensures longevity by preventing cancer development early in life. Longevity depends on the balance between tumor suppression and tissue renewal mechanisms ( Campisi and Yaswen, 2009 ). While genomic instability is a hallmark of aging, stem cell exhaustion is another important hallmark of aging ( L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al., 2013 ). It has been indicated that the anti-proliferative function of p53 which is crucial for tumor suppression could affect self-renewal function of stem/progenitor cells and contribute to aging ( van Heemst et al., 2005; Donehower, 2002 ). However, the precise role of p53 in aging process and longevity has not been clearly established. Inconsistent results on aging and longevity have been reported in different mouse models in which the p53 activity has been manipulated through different strategies ( Tyner et al., 2002; Dumble et al., 2007; Maier et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2010; Garc\u00eda-Cao et al., 2002; Mendrysa et al., 2006; Matheu et al., 2007 ). Specifically, transgenic mice with constitutively elevated p53 activity by expression of certain p53 mutants or a short p53 isoform showed increased cancer resistance but premature aging phenotypes ( Tyner et al., 2002; Dumble et al., 2007; Maier et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2010 ). The \u2018super p53\u2019 mice with a regulated hyperactive p53 activity by having an extra copy of the wild type Trp53 gene were resistant to cancer but did not exhibit signs of accelerated aging ( Garc\u00eda-Cao et al., 2002; Mendrysa et al., 2006 ). Interestingly, the \u2018super p53\u2019 mice with an extra copy of Ink4/Arf showed extended longevity ( Matheu et al., 2007; Matheu et al., 2009 ). It is worth noting that mouse models used in these studies did not reflect p53 activation under physiological conditions. It is therefore critical to address the role of p53 in the aging process and longevity using a proper mouse model reflecting the p53 activity under physiological conditions. TP53 is a haplo-insufficient gene, a little decrease in p53 levels or activity ( e. g. 2-fold difference ) significantly impacts tumorigenesis ( Venkatachalam et al., 2001; Berger and Pandolfi, 2011; Bond et al., 2004 ). p53 protein levels and activity are under tight regulation in cells ( Feng et al., 2008; Vousden and Prives, 2009 ). In humans, naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the p53 pathway, which modulate the activity or levels of p53, have been found to significantly impact cancer risk ( Bond et al., 2004; Whibley et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2008; Basu and Murphy, 2016 ). p53 codon 72 SNP is a common coding SNP in the TP53 gene, which results in either an arginine ( R72 ) or a proline ( P72 ) residue at codon 72. We and others have reported that compared with the R72 allele, the P72 allele displays a weaker p53 transcriptional activity towards a group of its target genes, many of which are involved in apoptosis and suppressing cell transformation ( Dumont et al., 2003; Jeong et al., 2010 ). Studies in human populations indicate that p53 codon 72 SNP may modify cancer risk, but currently the consensus has not been reached on this in the literature ( van Heemst et al., 2005; Whibley et al., 2009 ). Several studies of aged or general human populations indicate that\u00a0the P72 carriers have an increased lifespan despite an increased mortality from cancer ( van Heemst et al., 2005; Bojesen and Nordestgaard, 2008; Smetannikova et al., 2004 ). These epidemiological results support the dual functions of p53 in longevity, and suggest that codon 72 SNP may have an impact upon aging and longevity. Considering the genetic background variations of human populations and environmental factors in epidemiological studies, the precise role of p53 codon 72 SNP in aging and longevity remains elusive. In this study, we employed a mouse model with knock-in of human TP53 gene ( Hupki ) carrying codon 72 SNP to directly investigate the impact of p53 codon 72 SNP upon longevity and its underlying mechanism. The Hupki mice carrying codon 72 SNP recapture the impacts of codon 72 SNP upon p53 transcriptional activity and function in tumor suppression, which is widely used for studies on p53 and codon 72 SNP ( Feng et al., 2011; Kung et al., 2016; Azzam et al., 2011; Reinbold et al., 2008; Frank et al., 2011; Leu et al., 2013 ). We found that despite the increased cancer risk, P72 mice that have escaped tumor development have a longer lifespan than R72 mice and display a delay of age-associated phenotypes compared with R72 mice. Mechanistically, P72 mice have a better ability to retain the self-renewal function of stem/progenitor cells compared with R72 mice during the aging process. Long-term stem cells from aging P72 mice have better engraftment and repopulation abilities than aging R72 mice. In turn, P72 mice have less expansion of long-term stem/progenitor cells than R72 mice during the aging process. Taken together, our study provides direct genetic evidence demonstrating that human p53 codon 72 SNP has a direct impact upon aging and longevity in vivo, which supports the role of p53 in longevity.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: How long most animals live depends on the balance between the biological processes that allow them to regenerate their tissues when damaged and those that prevent them from developing cancer. Regeneration relies mostly on cells, in particular stem cells, dividing to make new cells, while cancer occurs when cell division becomes uncontrolled. Tumor suppressor genes protect against cancer. One such gene encodes a protein called p53 that eliminates damaged cells before they can become cancerous. The p53 protein is also believed to be involved in regulating how quickly an animal ages and how long it lives, but this second role has not yet been clearly established. Previous studies using different strategies to change the activity of p53 in several mouse models have led to inconsistent results. However, the mouse models used in these earlier studies did not reflect how p53 works under normal conditions. Zhao et al. have now used mice in which the mouse gene for p53 was replaced with one of two versions of the equivalent human gene to study its impact on lifespan and the aging process. The two versions of p53 only differ slightly; a single building block of the protein, the amino acid at position 72, is a proline in one version but an arginine in the other. This difference makes one version of p53 weaker than the other; in other words, it is less able to eliminate damaged cells. Zhao et al. revealed that the mice with the weaker p53 lived for longer and appeared to age more slowly too. Further experiments showed that the stem cells in the mice with a weaker p53 were able to keep dividing and create new cells for longer. This is important because a decline in this activity \u2013 which is known as self-renewal \u2013 is a hallmark of aging. Together these findings show that a small yet common change in p53 impacts both aging and lifespan, possibly by altering how stem cells are regulated. Further work is now needed to better understand why the different versions of p53 have different effects on stem cells ."}

Although the X-ray structures and overall arrangement of Gn and Gc on the hantavirus spikes are known, their detailed interactions are not. Here we show that the lateral contacts between spikes are mediated by the same 2-fold contacts observed in Gc crystals at neutral pH, allowing the engineering of disulfide bonds to cross-link spikes. Disrupting the observed dimer interface affects particle assembly and overall spike stability. We further show that the spikes display a temperature-dependent dynamic behavior at neutral pH, alternating between \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 forms. We show that the open form exposes the Gc fusion loops but is off-pathway for productive Gc-induced membrane fusion and cell entry. These data also provide crucial new insights for the design of optimized Gn/Gc immunogens to elicit protective immune responses.  Hantaviruses ( order Bunyavirales, family Hantaviridae, genus Orthohantavirus ) persistently infect rodents throughout the world. When transmitted to humans they can cause serious disease such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome ( HPS ) with case fatalities up to 10% and 40%, respectively ( Kr\u00fcger et al., 2015 ). Yet there are no efficient preventive nor therapeutic measures approved against these diseases. As other members of the Bunyavirales order, their RNA genome is single stranded with negative polarity, composed of three segments. The medium ( M ) segment encodes a membrane-anchored polyprotein precursor GPC, which is processed by host cell signal peptidases to generate glyoproteins Gn and Gc ( L\u00f6ber et al., 2001 ). Virion-like particles ( VLPs ) are formed when GPC is expressed in the absence of other viral proteins ( Acu\u00f1a et al., 2014 ), indicating an important role of the glycoproteins in virion budding and in cell exit of the progeny. Authentic virions and VLPs have been shown to project spikes organized in a square lattice ( Acu\u00f1a et al., 2014; Martin et al., 1985 ). The work of Hepojoki et al. ( 2010 ) revealed that Gn/Gc species can be covalently crosslinked on the surface of virions and suggested oligomeric models for spike assembly based on the characterization of detergent-solubilized spikes. Electron cryo-tomography ( cryo-ET ) data revealed spikes with volumes that can accommodate the molecular mass of ( Gn/Gc ) 4 hetero-octamers, related by 2-fold symmetry axes oriented radially in the particle ( Battisti et al., 2011; Huiskonen et al., 2010 ). A higher resolution 15. 6 \u00c5 cryo-ET map allowed the docking of the Gn ectodomain into the central lobes on the tetrameric spike, at the membrane distal side, and masking the Gc fusion loops, suggesting that the 2-fold related spike-spike interactions are made by the Gc moiety ( Li et al., 2016 ). Moreover, a central role of Gn in self-association to form spikes has recently been confirmed by number and brightness analysis in single live cells showing that separate Gn expression allows detection of Gn oligomers while separate Gc expression predominantly leads to Gc monomers and some Gc dimers ( Sperber et al., 2019 ). The Gn/Gc spikes on the viral surface are key in directing entry into new cells ( Cifuentes-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2014 ). Hantavirus cell entry occurs by the interaction of the envelope glycoproteins with host cell receptors, which leads to viral uptake into endosomes. Cell entry is completed when Gc induces the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane at acidic pH ( Acu\u00f1a et al., 2015 ). Structure-function studies have also confirmed that Gc is a class II fusion protein, and have provided insight into its fusogenic conformational change triggered by low pH ( Barriga et al., 2016; Guardado-Calvo et al., 2016; Tischler et al., 2005; Willensky et al., 2016 ). This irreversible structural rearrangement of Gc into a stable post-fusion trimer involves several steps, including the initial exposure of the Gc fusion loops, which then insert into the target cell membrane via an extended trimeric intermediate. The individual Gc trimer subunits then adopt a \u2018hairpin\u2019 conformation that forces apposition of viral and cellular membranes, to allow the bilayers to fuse. On the virion, the Gn and Gc residues involved in intra- and inter-spike interactions have not been identified. These interactions control the fusion activity of Gc ( Guardado-Calvo and Rey, 2017 ), by maintaining it at neutral pH in a functional metastable conformation ( Harrison, 2015 ). Here, we show that the 2-fold Gc:Gc contacts between adjacent ( Gn/Gc ) 4 spikes at the surface of the hantavirus particles are mediated by the same interface observed in a crystallographic dimer revealed by the available X-ray structure of Gc in a pre-fusion form. These contacts regulate viral assembly together with spike stability and subsequent disassembly for entry. We further demonstrate that at physiological temperature, the spikes exhibit a dynamic temperature-dependent equilibrium between a \u2018closed\u2019 form in which the fusion peptides are masked by Gn, and an \u2018open\u2019 form that allows the particle to bind to liposomes at neutral pH.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Hantaviruses infect rodents and other small mammals, but do not harm them. When transmitted to humans, often through rodent urine, feces or saliva, they can cause serious and even fatal diseases. Currently, there are no known methods that effectively prevent hantavirus infections or treat the diseases that they cause. During an infection, viruses invade the cells of their host. A hantavirus interacts with target cells through proteins on its surface called Gn and Gc glycoproteins. Previous work has shown that these glycoproteins are organized in bundles of four Gn and four Gc proteins, termed spikes, which project from the membrane that surrounds the virus. The Gc protein changes shape when it is activated and exposes a hidden region that can insert into the membrane of the target cell. The Gc proteins then change shape again to force the cell to fuse with the viral membrane. This process allows the virus to be taken up into the cell, where it can replicate. While the structures of each viral glycoprotein have been determined in isolation, it was not known how they interact within the Gn/Gc spike. Such information is crucial to understand how the viruses infect cells and which areas are exposed to the immune system of the host \u2013 and so could be targeted by antiviral treatments. Bignon et al. have now identified the molecular contacts that occur between spikes and interconnect them into a grid-like lattice on the surface of the virus. Genetically altering specific sections of the Gc glycoprotein strengthened or weakened these contacts, which correspondingly increased or decreased how stable the spike was. Preventing the contacts from forming resulted in cells releasing fewer virus-like particles. Bignon et al. also show that at the body temperature of mammals, the shape of the spike fluctuates between an \u2018open\u2019 form that exposes the region of Gc that inserts into the cell membrane, and a \u2018closed\u2019 form that hides this region. However, when Gc is activated, the open form becomes unable to cause the viral and cell membranes to fuse together. Together, the results presented by Bignon et al. help us to understand how changes to the hantavirus surface enable the virus to infect cells. This knowledge will help researchers to design vaccines that protect against hantavirus infections ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nNMDA receptors, which regulate synaptic strength and are implicated in learning and memory, consist of several subtypes with distinct subunit compositions and functional properties. To enable spatiotemporally defined, rapid and reproducible manipulation of function of specific subtypes, we engineered a set of photoswitchable GluN subunits ( 'LiGluNs' ). Photo-agonism of GluN2A or GluN2B elicits an excitatory drive to hippocampal neurons that can be shaped in time to mimic synaptic activation. Photo-agonism of GluN2A at single dendritic spines evokes spine-specific calcium elevation and expansion, the morphological correlate of LTP. Photo-antagonism of GluN2A alone, or in combination with photo-antagonism of GluN1a, reversibly blocks excitatory synaptic currents, prevents the induction of long-term potentiation and prevents spine expansion. In addition, photo-antagonism in vivo disrupts synaptic pruning of developing retino-tectal projections in larval zebrafish. By providing precise and rapidly reversible optical control of NMDA receptor subtypes, LiGluNs should help unravel the contribution of specific NMDA receptors to synaptic transmission, integration and plasticity.  NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels at excitatory synapses throughout the nervous system. They trigger long-term potentiation ( LTP ) and long-term depression ( LTD ) of synaptic strength and are implicated in memory formation, synapse development, circuit refinement, neuropsychiatric disorders, excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration ( Lau and Zukin, 2007; Nabavi et al., 2014 ). NMDA receptors are heterotetramers, consisting of two glycine-binding GluN1 subunits paired with two glutamate-binding GluN2 and/or glycine-binding GluN3 subunits, yielding a combinatorial diversity of channel composition and function ( Paoletti et al., 2013; Traynelis et al., 2010 ). The glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits ( GluN2A-D ) are encoded by four genes, which appear at specific developmental stages, bind distinct regulatory proteins, and are situated at diverse cellular locations ( Hardingham and Bading, 2010 ). The complexity of subunit stoichiometry and receptor localization has made it difficult to unravel the roles of NMDA receptor signaling in circuit function and behavior. Much has been learned about the function of NMDA receptors from pharmacological and genetic manipulations that target specific receptor subtypes ( Foster et al., 2010; Tang et al., 1999; Traynelis et al., 2010 ). However, pharmacological agents need to be used at low concentrations to maintain selectivity, resulting in slow onset, and are slow to wash out due to high affinity, are\u00a0difficult to confine spatially, and generally cannot be targeted to a specific cell. Genetic manipulations, like gene-knockout or RNA-interference, provide subunit-specificity, but are either for the life of the organism or, when conditional, slow to turn on and cannot typically be turned off. These chronic effects can lead to circuit changes and compensation ( Nakazawa et al., 2004; Rossi et al., 2015 ). Moreover, the ability to confine these manipulations to specific brain regions and cell types is limited. The problems of spatial and temporal control have been addressed by the advent of caged versions of glutamate, NMDA and the pore blocker MK-801, which can be photo-uncaged in very small volumes at precise times ( Huang et al., 2005; Kohl et al., 2011; Matsuzaki et al., 2001; Palma-Cerda et al., 2012; Rodr\u00edguez-Moreno et al., 2011 ). MK-801 can work from inside the cell and, therefore, can be loaded via the patch pipet, whereas glutamate and NMDA cannot and so cannot be targeted precisely to a specific cell; furthermore, none of these compounds are selective for receptor subtype. A recent development has been the subunit-specific control of an ion channel with a photo-reactive unnatural amino acid that enables photo-inactivation. So far, this methodology has been applied to a potassium channel ( Kang et al., 2013 ), AMPA receptor ( Klippenstein et al., 2014 ) and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors ( Zhu et al., 2014 ). However, photo-inactivation requires intense and prolonged irradiation with UV light and, importantly, is irreversible. To overcome the above obstacles, we set out to endow individual GluN subunits with fast and reversible light-switching via the site-directed, on-cell attachment of a Photoswitched Tethered Ligand ( PTL ). We employed PTLs from the 'MAG' family ( Figure 1a ), which consist of Maleimide ( for covalent attachment to a cysteine residue substituted onto the water exposed surface of the ligand binding domain of the GluN subunit ), a photo-isomerizable Azobenzene linked to a Glutamate ligand ( for synthesis see [Volgraf et al., 2006] ). Illumination with near UV light ( 360\u2013405 nm; violet light ) isomerizes MAG into the bent cis-configuration, whereas illumination with blue-green light ( 460\u2013560 nm; green light ) isomerizes MAG to the trans-configuration ( Figure 1a ) ( Gorostiza and Isacoff, 2008 ). By choosing geometrically favorable positions for introduction of the cysteine attachment site ( Figure 1b and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and altering the length of the MAG molecule by varying the linker via additional glycine ( s ) ( Figure 1a, dashed brackets; n ), the glutamate moiety of MAG can be designed to either engage or obstruct the ligand binding pocket in the cis configuration, and withdraw from the ligand binding pocket in the trans configuration, yielding light-dependent gating ( Figure 1c and Figure 2a, but see also [Numano et al., 2009] ). PTLs, including MAGs, have been employed to generate light-gated ionotropic kainate receptors ( Janovjak et al., 2010; Reiner et al., 2015; Szobota et al., 2007; Volgraf et al., 2006 ), metabotropic glutamate receptors ( Levitz et al., 2013 ), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( Tochitsky et al., 2012 ), P2X receptors ( Lemoine et al., 2013 ) and GABAA receptors ( Lin et al., 2014 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 12040. 003Figure 1.

MAG0 and MAG1 differ in length ( brackets, n = 0, 1 ) ( Gorostiza et al., 2007 ), whereas L-MAG and D-MAG ( Levitz et al., 2013 ) differ in stereochemistry ( red asterisk ). Illumination with 360\u2013405 nm light photoisomerizes MAG from the elongated trans- azobenzene ( red ) configuration to the bent cis configuration; illumination at ~460\u2013560 nm returns MAG to the trans isomer, as does slow\u00a0thermal relaxation in the dark. The maleimide group ( cyan ) allows attachment to an engineered cysteine.

The MAG photoswitch ( color-coded sticks; as shown in a ) is covalently attached to the LBD ( cyan dot ) to endow the channel with light-sensitivity. The cis configuration allows docking of the glutamate headgroup ( orange triangle ) into the binding pocket ( middle cartoon ), inducing LBD closure and channel opening ( rightward cartoon ). For simplicity the ligand of the GluN1 subunit ( glycine ) is not shown.

Photo-current is elicited by 380 nm light ( ~3 mW/mm2 ) ( violet bar ) and turned off by 500 nm light ( ~3 mW/mm2 ) ( green bar ). Full activation is induced by application of 1 mM glutamate or NMDA ( black bar ).

The cis state of MAG is photo-stable, so that following illumination ( targeted\u00a0line-scanning ) by a brief 405 nm laser pulse ( 2 s ) over a large region of the dendritic tree ( dashed violet box ) induces an inward current ( black trace, ON ) that persists in the dark without visible decay for tens of seconds ( see also Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ). Likewise, following closure of the channel ( black trace- OFF ) with brief green light ( 488 nm ) illumination ( 2 sec ), the channel remains shut and no current is observed unless triggered anew\u00a0by violet light. Spontaneous EPSCs are observed during the opening and closing of the channel. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 12040. 00310. 7554/eLife. 12040. 004Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1. Screen of GluN2A cysteine positions and MAG variants. ( a ) Amino acids near the glutamate binding site of GluN2A were individually replaced with cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis, co-transfected with wild-type GluN1a into HEK293 cells, and tested with several MAG variants: L-MAG0, L-MAG1, L-MAG2 and D-MAG1, previously used ( Levitz et al., 2013; Volgraf et al., 2006 ). Photo-responses were detected by calcium-imaging with Fura2-AM and characterized as agonist or antagonist by photo-switching in the absence and presence of 1 mM glutamate, respectively. Most photo-responses, albeit small, were detected during illumination with 380 nm light ( violet ), one during illumination at 500 nm ( green ), and several exhibited no photo-response ( grey ). The colors in the first column correspond to the sites group-colored in the structure of GluN2A\u2019s LBD on the left ( PDB-2A5S [Furukawa et al., 2005] ). The largest agonistic and antagonistic photo-responses yielded by violet light illumination ( emphasized by solid boxes and colored fonts ) were GluN2A ( V713C ) conjugated to L-MAG1 and GluN2A ( G712C ) conjugated to L-MAG0, respectively, and were subsequently scrutinized using patch clamping techniques ( examples shown in b, c and see main figures ).

Representative traces from cultured hippocampal neurons ( from wt rats ) showing the versatility of the photo-switching technique and responses in neurons. Illumination at 405 nm ( violet bars ) is used to open the channels ( downward inflection of the current ), whereas 488 nm ( green bars, upward inflection of the current ) to close them. This could be done repeatedly at low ( b ) or high switching frequency ( c ). DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 12040. 00410. 7554/eLife. 12040. 005Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2.

Representative images of neurons ( 15 DIV ) from wt animals following incubation for 45 min with either L-MAG1, 0. 3% DMSO ( in NMDG buffer ) or NMDG buffer alone ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) showed no reduction in cell viability ( green labeling ) or membrane integrity ( red labeling, neurites ) compared to untreated cells ( no treatment prior labeling ) and Summary ( right ) ( N coverslips= no treatment ( no treatm. ) - 2, +NMDG- 2, +DMSO- 5, +L-MAG1- 9 ).

( d ) Transfection of GFP-GluN2A ( G712C ) ( orange bar ) did alter GluNR-expression compared to GFP only -transfected neurons ( green bar ), as no change in total current amplitude induced by 1 mM NMDA was observed. To note, these observations are in line with earlier reports demonstrating that MAG ( and related PTLs ) do not have non-specific action or adverse effect on neuronal physiology ( Caporale et al., 2011; Lemoine et al., 2013; Levitz et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Szobota et al., 2007; Tochitsky et al., 2012; Volgraf et al., 2006 ).

A HEK293 cell transfected with GluN1a and LiGluN2B ( V714C ), and labeled with L-MAG1, when illuminated with 380 nm light ( violet bars ) produces an inward photo-current that can be turned off by 510 nm light ( green bars ). Note the small increase in current during glutamate perfusion, suggesting that L-MAG1 may act as a stronger agonist than glutamate.

Hippocampal neurons ( from wt rats ), transfected with either LiGluN2A ( top black trace ) or -2B ( bottom grey trace ) exhibit similar inward photo-currents, during which barrages of spontaneous EPSCs emerge ( violet bars ), demonstrating that photo-activation of LiGluNs receptors causes action potential firing of presynaptic neurons ( see also Figure 4 and Figure 4 supplements ).

The first three LiGluN subunits enable selective manipulation of GluN2A- or GluN2B-containing receptors, whereas the fourth operates as a general controller of all plasma membrane NMDA receptors, owing to the obligatory occurrence of GluN1 in all NMDA\u00a0receptors. We show that LiGluN-containing NMDA receptors function normally, incorporate into synapses, and that their expression does not alter NMDA receptor expression levels. Photoswitching can be sculpted to generate NMDA receptor currents that mimic the fast ( GluN2A-like ) or slow ( GluN2B-like ) deactivation kinetics of native excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ). Widefield illumination and photo-activation of LiGluN2A or LiGluN2B-containing receptors in primary hippocampal neurons robustly drives activity, whereas photo-antagonism of LiGluN2A and LiGluN1a reversibly block excitatory synaptic currents. Spatially-targeted photo-activation of LiGluN2A-containing receptors on single dendritic spines can be used to trigger a spine-specific increase in calcium and the spine expansion that is associated with LTP. Complementarily to this, photo-antagonism of LiGluN2A-containing receptors can block LTP-induction via Schaffer collateral stimulation or prevent spine expansion. LiGluNs fulfill a major promise of chemical optogenetic photo-pharmacology by providing the kind of spatio-temporally precise control that is obtained with heterologous microbial opsins, that over-ride normal cellular signals, but in this case to control the native neuronal signaling proteins of the synapse that play central roles in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Together, these tools may open the door to advanced studies of receptor biophysics, and their function in synapses and neural circuits.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Within the nervous system, neurons are organized into extensive networks via connections called synapses. To signal across a synapse, one neuron releases chemical messengers that bind to \u201creceptors\u201d on the surface of the neighboring cell. The ease with which neurons can communicate can change depending on how often a synapse is used. This adaptability is known as synaptic plasticity, and is central to the formation of memories. NMDA receptors are one group of receptors that play an important role in synaptic plasticity. There are several types of NMDA receptor, which are made up of different combinations of protein subunits and have different properties. This means that each type contributes to synaptic plasticity in a slightly different way. Other receptors found in neurons have been studied using a technique called chemical optogenetics, which allows the activity of modified proteins to be turned on and off by light. Now, Berlin, Szobota et al. have designed a toolbox that enables the activity of four of the NMDA receptor subunits to be controlled with light, which activates or blocks the NMDA receptors that they form ( which includes several of the main receptor types ). Thus, how these types of NMDA receptor contribute to synaptic plasticity can be investigated. The toolbox can be used to control synaptic plasticity under a wide range of conditions. Plasticity can be induced or prevented in either single synaptic connections or large regions containing many thousands of synapses. The approach works in individual neurons grown artificially in the laboratory, in brain slices and in the living brain. Furthermore, synaptic plasticity can be controlled precisely to affect single synaptic events ( which occur in milliseconds ) or it can be controlled over several days to study whether this affects how neurons develop. The next steps will be to expand the toolset so that the activity of all the NMDA receptor subtypes can be controlled using light. Further studies could then incorporate the receptors into the brains of mammals to study how the receptors\u2019 activity affects a range of processes including memory formation and disease ."}

Elucidating the mechanisms that control autoinducer production is, thus, pertinent to understanding collective microbial behavior, such as virulence and bioluminescence. Recent experiments have shown a heterogeneous promoter activity of autoinducer synthase genes, suggesting that some of the isogenic cells in a population might produce autoinducers, whereas others might not. However, the mechanism underlying this phenotypic heterogeneity in quorum-sensing microbial populations has remained elusive. In our theoretical model, cells synthesize and secrete autoinducers into the environment, up-regulate their production in this self-shaped environment, and non-producers replicate faster than producers. We show that the coupling between ecological and population dynamics through quorum sensing can induce phenotypic heterogeneity in microbial populations, suggesting an alternative mechanism to stochastic gene expression in bistable gene regulatory circuits.  Autoinducers are small molecules that are produced by microbes, secreted into the environment, and sensed by the cells in the population ( Keller and Surette, 2006; Hense and Schuster, 2015 ). Autoinducers can trigger a collective behavior of all cells in a population, which is called quorum sensing. For example, quorum sensing regulates the transcription of virulence genes in the Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes ( Gray et al., 2006; Garmyn et al., 2011; da Silva and De Martinis, 2013 ) and the transcription of bioluminescence genes in the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio harveyi ( Xavier and Bassler, 2003; Anetzberger et al., 2009 ), and it may also autoregulate the transcription of autoinducer synthase genes ( Fuqua and Greenberg, 2002; Waters and Bassler, 2005 ). When the concentration of autoinducers reaches a threshold value, a coordinated and homogeneous expression of target genes may be initiated in all cells of the population ( Waters and Bassler, 2005; Hense and Schuster, 2015; Papenfort and Bassler, 2016 ), or a heterogeneous gene expression in the population may be triggered at low concentrations ( Anetzberger et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2008; Boedicker et al., 2009; Garmyn et al., 2011; P\u00e9rez and Hagen, 2010; Ackermann, 2015; Grote et al., 2014, Grote et al., 2015; Papenfort and Bassler, 2016; Pradhan and Chatterjee, 2014 ). To implement all of these functions and behaviors, a microbial population needs to dynamically self-regulate the average autoinducer production. Within a given population, the promoter activity of autoinducer synthase genes may vary between genetically identical cells ( Garmyn et al., 2011; Grote et al., 2014; Anetzberger et al., 2012; Plener et al., 2015; C\u00e1rcamo-Oyarce et al., 2015; Grote et al., 2015 ). For example, during the growth of L. monocytogenes under well-mixed conditions two subpopulations were observed, one of which expressed autoinducer synthase genes, while the other did not ( Garmyn et al., 2011 ). Such a phenotypic heterogeneity was associated with biofilm formation ( Garmyn et al., 2011; da Silva and De Martinis, 2013; Hense and Schuster, 2015; C\u00e1rcamo-Oyarce et al., 2015 ). The stable coexistence of different phenotypes in one population may serve the division of labor or act as a bet-hedging strategy and, thus, may be beneficial for the survival and resilience of a microbial species on long time scales ( Ackermann, 2015 ). The mechanism by which a heterogeneous expression of autoinducer synthase genes is established when their expression is autoregulated by quorum sensing has remained elusive. For example, expression of the above mentioned autoinducer synthase genes in L. monocytogenes is up-regulated through quorum-sensing in single cells ( Garmyn et al., 2011, Garmyn et al., 2009; Waters and Bassler, 2005 ). From an experimental point of view it is often not known, however, whether autoinducer synthesis is up-regulated for all autoinducer levels or only above a threshold level. To explain phenotypic heterogeneity of autoinducer production, currently favored threshold models of quorum sensing typically assume a bistable gene regulation function ( Fujimoto and Sawai, 2013; P\u00e9rez-Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2016; Goryachev et al., 2005; Dockery and Keener, 2001 ). For bistable regulation, cellular autoinducer synthesis is up-regulated above a threshold value of the autoinducer concentration in the population, whereas it is down-regulated below the threshold ( 'all-or-none' expression ) ; see Figure 1B. Stochastic gene expression at the cellular level then explains the coexistence of different phenotypes in one population. If, however, cellular autoinducer synthesis is up-regulated for all autoinducer concentrations ( monostable up-regulation ), the mechanism by which phenotypic heterogeneity can arise and is controlled has not been explained. 10. 7554/eLife. 25773. 003Figure 1. The quorum-sensing model for the production of autoinducers in microbial populations. ( A ) Sketch of a typical update step. Individuals are depicted as disks and the degree of autoinducer production ( pi\u2208[0, 1] ) is indicated by the size of the green fraction. Non-producers ( orange disks ) reproduce fastest, full producers ( green disks ) slowest. Individual i with pi=1/6 divides into two offspring individuals, one of which replaces another individual j. Both offspring individuals sense the average production level in the population ( \u27e8p\u27e9=1/3 ), and may either respond to this environment, with probability \u03bb, by adopting the value R\u2062 ( \u27e8p\u27e9 ) of the response function ( =2/3 here, see ( B ) ) or, with probability 1-\u03bb, retain the production degree from the ancestor ( =1/6 ). Here, offspring individual i responds to the environment while j does not ( denoted by gray shading ). ( B ) Quorum sensing is characterized by the response function. Perception of the average production level in the population ( \u27e8p\u27e9 ) enables individuals to change their production degree to the value R\u2062 ( \u27e8p\u27e9 ) \u2208[0, 1]. Sketched are a monostable response function ( stable fixed point at 1, unstable fixed point at 0 ), and a bistable response function ( stable fixed points at 0 and 1, unstable fixed point at an intermediate threshold value ). Stable fixed points of the response function are depicted as black circles while unstable fixed points are colored in white. For the sketched bistable response function, autoinducer production is down-regulated with respect to the sensed production level in the population below the threshold value, and up-regulated above this threshold. For the monostable response function, autoinducer production is up-regulated at all sensed production levels. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 25773. 003 Here we show that the coupling between ecological and population dynamics through quorum sensing can control a heterogeneous production of autoinducers in quorum-sensing microbial populations. At the same time, the overall autoinducer level in the environment is robustly self-regulated, so that further quorum-sensing functions such as virulence or bioluminescence can be triggered. We studied the collective behavior of a stochastic many-particle model of quorum sensing, in which cells produce autoinducers to different degrees and secrete them into the well-mixed environment. Production of large autoinducer molecules ( for example oligopeptides ) and accompanied gene expression are assumed to reduce fitness such that non-producers reproduce faster than producing cells. Moreover, it is assumed that quorum sensing enables up-regulation of autoinducer production, that is, individuals can increase their production in response to the sensed average production level in the population ( Figure 1 ). As a central result, we found that the population may split into two subpopulations: one with a low, and a second with a high production rate of autoinducers. This phenotypic heterogeneity in the autoinducer production is stable for many generations and the autoinducer concentration in the population is tightly controlled by how production is up-regulated. If cellular response to the environment is absent or too frequent, phase transitions occur from heterogeneous to homogeneous populations in which all individuals produce autoinducers to the same degree. To capture these emergent dynamics, we derived the macroscopic mean-field equation ( 1 ) from the microscopic stochastic many-particle process in the spirit of the kinetic theory in statistical physics, which we refer to as the autoinducer equation. The analysis of the autoinducer equation explains both phenotypic heterogeneity through quorum sensing and the phase transitions to homogeneity. The key aspect of our work is how the composition of a population changes in time when its constituents respond to an environment that is being shaped by their own activities ( see Box 1 ). This ecological feedback is mediated by quorum sensing and creates an effective global coupling between the individuals in the population. Such a global coupling is reminiscent of long-range interactions in models of statistical mechanics, such as in the classical XY spin model with infinite range interactions ( Antoni and Ruffo, 1995; Yamaguchi et al., 2004; Barr\u00e9 et al., 2002; Choi and Choi, 2003; de Buyl et al., 2010; Campa et al., 2009; Pakter and Levin, 2013 ). Our analysis suggests that quorum sensing in microbial populations can induce and control phenotypic heterogeneity as a collective behavior through such a global coupling and, notably, does not rely on a bistable gene regulatory circuit ( see Discussion ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Bacteria and other microbes can communicate with each other using chemical languages. They release small signaling molecules called autoinducers into their surroundings and sense the levels of the autoinducers in the environment. The response to these autoinducers \u2013 known as quorum sensing \u2013 can regulate how whole communities of microbes grow and behave; for example, autoinducers can alter the ability of microbes to infect humans or enable the microbes to collectively switch on light production. Recent experiments suggest that, in a population of genetically identical microbes, some individuals may produce autoinducers while others do not. The coexistence of these different \u201cphenotypes\u201d in one population may enable different individuals to perform different roles, or act as a \u201cbet-hedging\u201d strategy that helps the population to survive if it is later exposed to a stressful situation. It is not clear how microbes regulate autoinducer production so that only some individuals produce these molecules. Bauer, Knebel et al. developed a theoretical model to address this question. In the model, the microbes shape their environment by producing autoinducers and can respond to this self-shaped environment by changing their level of autoinducer production. Bauer, Knebel et al. found that this establishes a feedback loop that can result in autoinducers being produced by some individuals but not others. The next step following on from this work is to carry out experiments to test the assumptions and predictions made by the theoretical model. These findings may help to understand how the coexistence of different phenotypes affects collective behaviors, and vice versa, in populations of microbes that use quorum-sensing ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMany animals change their body color for visual signaling and environmental adaptation. Some dragonflies show wax-based color change and ultraviolet ( UV ) reflection, but the biochemical properties underlying the phenomena are totally unknown. Here we investigated the UV-reflective abdominal wax of dragonflies, thereby identifying very long-chain methyl ketones and aldehydes as unique and major wax components. Little wax was detected on young adults, but dense wax secretion was found mainly on the dorsal abdomen of mature males of Orthetrum albistylum and O. melania, and pruinose wax secretion was identified on the ventral abdomen of mature females of O. albistylum and Sympetrum darwinianum. Comparative transcriptomics demonstrated drastic upregulation of the ELOVL17 gene, a member of the fatty acid elongase gene family, whose expression reflected the distribution of very long-chain methyl ketones. Synthetic 2-pentacosanone, the major component of dragonfly\u2019s wax, spontaneously formed light-scattering scale-like fine structures with strong UV reflection, suggesting its potential utility for biomimetics.  Many organisms exhibit a variety of body color patterns for visual communication and environmental adaptation. The diversity of the color patterns encompasses the ultraviolet ( UV ) range, reflecting the fact that many animals can detect UV light as well as green, blue and/or red\u00a0light ( Osorio and Vorobyev, 2008 ). UV reflection has been reported from numerous organisms\u00a0and may be important not only for protection against UV-induced damage but also for visual signaling ( Silberglied, 1979; Eaton and Lanyon, 2003; Paul and Gwynn-Jones, 2003; Lee, 2007 ). Previous studies on biological UV reflection have focused on its optical properties and structural bases, such as multilayer surface structures ( Sun et al., 2013 ). In some plants and insects, the\u00a0production and secretion of wax on their surface has\u00a0been reported to increase UV reflection ( Clark and Lister, 1975; Pope, 1979; Holmes and Keiller, 2002; Kakani et al., 2003 ). Dragonflies ( including damselflies ) are colorful, large-eyed, diurnal and actively\u00a0flying insects, whose body colors often differ markedly\u00a0between sexes, developmental stages, and closely\u00a0related species ( Tillyard, 1917; Corbet, 1999; Futahashi et al., 2012; Futahashi, 2016;\u00a0Futahashi, 2017; Bybee et al., 2016 ). Because dragonflies are able to perceive UV light ( Bybee et al., 2012; Futahashi et al., 2015 ), it seems plausible that UV color also plays important roles in their mate recognition, in\u00a0male\u2013male competition and\u00a0in other\u00a0ecological characteristics such as habitat selection and behavioral differences. Several studies have reported that the presence of a pruinose wax layer on the body surface accounts for UV reflection patterns in dragonflies ( Silberglied, 1979; Robertson, 1984; Hilton, 1986; Gorb, 1995; Harris et al., 2011 ), but the biochemical properties\u00a0and molecular composition of the wax, and the\u00a0genes involved in wax production\u00a0by\u00a0dragonflies, are totally unknown. Here, we mainly focus on the white-tailed skimmer dragonfly ( Orthetrum albistylum ), which is one of the most common dragonfly species in Japan ( Sugimura et al., 2001; Ozono et al., 2012 ). As sexual maturity is\u00a0reached, adult males of O. albistylum show wax-based body color change from light brown to blueish white, whereas adult females remain brownish throughout most of their lifetime, although very aged females become slightly whitish ( Figure 1A ) ( Sugimura et al., 2001; Ozono et al., 2012 ). Notably, androchrome females, whose body color is very similar to that of adult males, have been recorded, though very rarely, in the field ( Figure 1A ) ( Sugimura et al., 2001; Ozono et al., 2012 ). Androchrome females can be distinguished from very aged females because the dorsal abdomen is more whitish than the ventral abdomen after\u00a0the semimature stages ( Sugimura et al., 2001; Ozono et al., 2012 ). In this study, we investigated the ultrastructure, reflectance, wettability, chemical composition, self-organization, and biosynthesis pathway of surface wax in O. albistylum and allied dragonfly species. We found that, during the maturation process, adult males secrete a strongly light-scattering wax layer onto their body surface, thereby increasing their visibility not only in the blue and green wavelength ranges but also in the UV range. Chemically, the UV-reflective surface wax consisted of very long-chain methyl ketones and aldehydes, which have not been previously identified as major wax components. Comparative transcriptomics identified a gene encoding a member of the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids ( ELOVL ) protein family, whose expression was strongly correlated with the distribution of very long-chain methyl ketones on the surface of dragonflies. Notably, chemically\u00a0synthesized 2-pentacosanone, the major component of the surface wax, spontaneously formed scale-like fine structures that strongly reflected UV light. These results provide a previously undescribed molecular and structural basis for wax-based body color change and UV reflection that\u00a0has ecological and applied relevance.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Humans have often looked to nature for answers to problems. Living things has evolved for millions of years to deal with life\u2019s challenges, and so engineers and inventors faced with similar challenges can also take inspiration from the natural world. Several plants and animals, for instance, reflect ultraviolet light. This ability may protect them from some of the damaging effects of sunlight; materials with similar properties would have a range of uses, including as coatings on windows that protect our homes and furniture or as cosmetics that protect ourselves in the same way. Some dragonflies \u2013 including the white-tailed skimmer, which is particularly common in Japan \u2013 are partly coated with a wax that reflects both ultraviolet and visible light. These insects can also see ultraviolet light, which means it is likely that they also use the reflective wax to send visual signals to one another. However, the biochemistry of this wax and the genes involved in its production remained poorly understood. Futahashi et al. have now found that the dragonfly wax consists mostly of very long-chain molecules known as methyl ketones and aldehydes; neither of which are a common components of other waxes. The wax was found in distinct patches on the bodies of adults; these patches were colored white with a hint of blue, while the rest of the dragonfly was mostly brown. Looking at gene activity in different parts of the dragonflies showed that a gene called ELOVL17 is much more active in the wax-coated areas. This gene encodes an enzyme that makes long-chain molecules, and its activity closely matched the distribution of the especially long-chain methyl ketones on the dragonflies\u2019 surface. Futahashi et al. then synthesized the major component of the surface wax \u2013 specifically, a chemical called 2-pentacosanone \u2013 in the laboratory, and saw that it spontaneously formed fine, scale-like structures that strongly reflected ultraviolet light. Further work is now needed to explore the potential applications of this bio-inspired wax, and to understand exactly what the dragonflies use it for in the wild ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nOuter hair cells ( OHCs ) in the mammalian ear exhibit electromotility, electrically driven somatic length changes that are thought to mechanically amplify sound-evoked vibrations. For this amplification to work, OHCs must respond to sounds on a cycle-by-cycle basis even at frequencies that exceed the low-pass corner frequency of their cell membranes. Using in vivo optical vibrometry we tested this theory by measuring sound-evoked motility in the 13\u201325 kHz region of the gerbil cochlea. OHC vibrations were strongly rectified, and motility exhibited first-order low-pass characteristics with corner frequencies around 3 kHz\u2013 more than 2. 5 octaves below the frequencies the OHCs are expected to amplify. These observations lead us to suggest that the OHCs operate more like the envelope detectors in a classical gain-control scheme than like high-frequency sound amplifiers. These findings call for a fundamental reconsideration of the role of the OHCs in cochlear function and the causes of cochlear hearing loss.  The hair bundles of auditory sensory cells are deflected by sound-driven vibrations, causing mechano-electric transduction channels to open and close. The resulting receptor current modulates the cell\u2019s membrane potential. The mammalian cochlea contains two distinct types of hair cells. The vast majority of nerve fibers that carry the acoustic information to the brain innervate the inner hair cells ( IHC ). Up to a few kilohertz, IHC synapses can \u2018phase-lock, \u2019 that\u00a0is, code the individual cycles of tones. At higher frequencies ( >3 kHz ), phase-locking rapidly declines and neural coding relies on the DC component of the IHC receptor potential generated by the asymmetric, or rectifying, nature of the IHC receptor current ( Russell and Sellick, 1978 ). Outer hair cells ( OHC ) modify the mechanical vibrations inside the organ of Corti ( OoC ), enabling frequency tuning and dynamic range compression. Dysfunctional and missing OHCs strongly reduce sensitivity, and this is a major cause of sensorineural hearing loss ( Ryan and Dallos, 1975 ). The discovery of electromotility, length changes of isolated OHCs ( Brownell et al., 1985 ) driven by variations in the membrane potential ( Santos-Sacchi and Dilger, 1988 ), has intensified the study of OHCs and their functional significance. The membrane protein responsible for electromotility has been identified ( Zheng et al., 2000 ), and prestin knockout mice have profound hearing loss ( Liberman et al., 2002 ). The dominant view is that OHC electromotility drives vibrations within the OoC in a cycle-by-cycle manner ( Ashmore, 2011 ) over the entire audible range, which extends up to 150 kHz in some species ( Vater and K\u00f6ssl, 2011 ). If this view is correct, the AC receptor potentials of OHCs must be large enough to be effective up to high frequencies, even though the membrane capacitance is expected to reduce the AC receptor potentials ( and hence the OHCs' motility ) at a rate of 6 dB per octave ( Dallos, 1984 ). The functional implication of this electrical low-pass filtering is a limitation in the OHC\u2019s ability to provide cycle-by-cycle mechanical feedback, known as the RC problem ( Ashmore, 2011; Housley and Ashmore, 1992 ). The electrical corner frequency of OHCs has been measured electrophysiologically in vitro, with highest values ranging from 480 Hz ( Mammano and Ashmore, 1996 ) to 1250 Hz ( Johnson et al., 2011 ), but no systematic in vivo data exist due to technical limitations and the cochlea\u2019s extreme vulnerability. In addition to the electrical filtering, the motile process itself may also be too slow to provide high-frequency mechanical feedback. An early in vitro report claiming a bandwidth for electromotility of at least 79 kHz ( Frank et al., 1999 ) was recently challenged ( Santos-Sacchi and Tan, 2018 ). Again, in vivo estimates of the corner frequency of motility are missing. Here we use optical vibrometry to measure non-linear components of the OHCs' motile response and determine the corner frequency of OHCs in the high-frequency region of the intact gerbil cochlea.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Our ears give us our sense of hearing. Their job is to collect sounds and pass this information on to the brain. Hair cells, a special group of cells in the ear, are responsible for detecting sound vibrations and turning them into the electrical signals that our brains can understand. The ear contains two populations of hair cells: inner hair cells that send signals to the brain, and outer hair cells that act as a protective \u2018buffer\u2019 by modulating sound vibrations entering the innermost part of the ear. When outer hair cells are damaged, the vibrations picked up by inner hair cells are much smaller than in a healthy ear. This has led to the idea that outer hair cells actively amplify sounds before passing them on. That is, outer hair cells simultaneously act like microphones ( by receiving sound from the environment ) and loudspeakers ( by re-emitting magnified vibrations ). One problem with this amplifier theory is that it cannot explain how some animals are able to hear extremely high-pitched sounds. If the theory is true, outer hair cells should be able to re-emit ultrasonic vibrations. However, some observations suggest that they may not vibrate fast enough to do so. To test the amplifier theory, Vavakou et al. measured how outer hair cells in the ear of Mongolian gerbils responded to different sounds. This revealed that the motion of these cells could keep up with moderately high sounds ( around the upper end of a piano\u2019s range ), but were too sluggish to amplify ultrasound despite gerbils having good ultrasonic hearing. Further experiments showed that instead of acting like amplifiers, outer hair cells seem to monitor the loudness of sound and adjust the level accordingly before passing the vibrations on to the inner hair cells. These results shed new light on how outer hair cells help our ears work. Since damage to these cells can cause hearing loss, understanding how they work could one day guide new methods of protecting or even restoring hearing in vulnerable patients ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nSeveral genes positively influence final leaf size in Arabidopsis when mutated or overexpressed. The connections between these growth regulators are still poorly understood although such knowledge would further contribute to understand the processes driving leaf growth. In this study, we performed a combinatorial screen with 13 transgenic Arabidopsis lines with an increased leaf size. We found that from 61 analyzed combinations, 39% showed an additional increase in leaf size and most resulted from a positive epistasis on growth. Similar to what is found in other organisms in which such an epistasis assay was performed, only few genes were highly connected in synergistic combinations as we observed a positive epistasis in the majority of the combinations with samba, BRI1OE or SAUR19OE. Furthermore, positive epistasis was found with combinations of genes with a similar mode of action, but also with genes which affect distinct processes, such as cell proliferation and cell expansion.  Since Bateson introduced the term epistasis to describe the phenomenon that some mutations seemed to be \u2018stopping\u2019 or \u2018standing above\u2019 the effect of other mutations ( Bateson, 1909 ), it became clear that interactions between multiple genes influence many traits. Epistasis, or interaction between genes, therefore corresponds to any deviation from the expected phenotype, predicted by combining the effects of individual alleles or mutations ( Fisher, 1918; Phillips, 2008 ). Only by identifying and understanding the nature of these underlying gene interactions, we will gain better insights in the regulation of complex traits and be able to dissect the architecture of biological networks. In the last decade, numerous studies on the effect of pairwise gene perturbations have been conducted, primarily in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to systematically evaluate epistasis for several characteristics, such as fitness or synthetic lethality ( Tong et al., 2004; Jasnos and Korona, 2007; St Onge et al., 2007; Dixon et al., 2009; Costanzo et al., 2010, 2011 ). These genome-scale genetic interactions studies were facilitated by the availability of large collections of deletion strains and the development of automated platforms to analyze the phenotypes of double mutants ( Scherens and Goffeau, 2004 ). Since the first large-scale genetic interaction study in yeast identified 4000 genetic interactions among 1000 genes when analyzing synthetic lethality in double deletion mutants ( Tong et al., 2004 ), the field advanced considerably. Currently, about 170, 000 interactions are known among 5. 4 million gene pairs screened to affect fitness ( Baryshnikova et al., 2010; Costanzo et al., 2010 ). Interestingly, these studies have shown that the majority of the genes are infrequently connected in the genetic interaction network, while a small fraction of genes shows many interactions ( Baryshnikova et al., 2010; Costanzo et al., 2010, 2011 ). In higher organisms, large collections of mutants often do not exist and/or the generation of double mutants is much more labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, in Drosophila cell cultures and in human cell lines, global analysis of genetic interactions have been performed by making use of RNA interference libraries to generate double mutants ( Lehner et al., 2006; Byrne et al., 2007; Barbie et al., 2009; Horn et al., 2011 ). In C. elegans, systematic mapping of interactions between genes functioning in the signaling and the transcriptional networks that regulate development also revealed high connectivity of a small proportion of genes in the network, while most genes have few interactions ( Lehner et al., 2006 ). In plants, although large collections of mutants are available for some species such as Arabidopsis ( Alonso et al., 2003; http://www. arabidopsis. org/ ), large-scale epistasis studies on double mutants are experimentally and practically virtually impossible to achieve. On a smaller scale, newly identified mutants in Arabidopsis are crossed with known mutants with similar phenotypes or within the same biological process to test for allelic interaction or epistasis. For example, genetic interactions among late flowering Arabidopsis mutants have been studied by generating double mutants ( Koornneef et al., 1998 ). Further, genetic modifier screens are performed frequently through a random mutagenesis of individuals harboring one mutant gene to screen for second-site mutations that either enhance or suppress the primary phenotype. An example in relation to leaf size is the identification of enhancer mutations of da1-1 further increasing leaf and seed size ( Li et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2008; Xu and Li, 2011; Fang et al., 2012 ). While epistasis can easily be detected for qualitative traits, such as synthetic lethality, which are fairly straightforward to visually inspect, genetic interactions from quantitative traits, such as organ growth or gene expression, are more difficult to identify, especially in multicellular organisms ( Kroymann and Mitchell-Olds, 2005; Malmberg et al., 2005; Xu and Jia, 2007; Chapman et al., 2012; Steinhoff et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2014 ). Estimating epistasis for quantitative categories of phenotypes implies calculating how much the phenotype of a double mutant deviates from an expected additive value based on the effect of the single mutations ( Fisher, 1918 ), therefore requiring accurate measurements of the phenotype of the single and double mutants. Although enabling the identification of subtle interactions, these quantitative analyses of gene interactions are not easily amenable to large-scale studies of complex traits. One example of such a complex quantitative trait in higher plants is leaf growth. Leaves are essential to capture solar radiation and convert it into chemical energy by photosynthesis, therefore contributing to a large part of plant biomass production. As for most plant organs, their determinate growth pattern results in a relatively constant size within a fixed environment. Leaf growth is mediated by a cell proliferation phase followed by a cell expansion phase that initiates at the leaf top and proceeds basipetally ( Donnelly et al., 1999; Andriankaja et al., 2012 ). At least five different parameters contribute to the final leaf size ( Gonzalez et al., 2012 ) : the number of cells incorporated in leaf primordia; the rate of cell division; the developmental window of cell proliferation; the timing of meristemoid division; and the extent of cell expansion. Several genes have been described to, when downregulated or ectopically ( over ) expressed, increase the final leaf size in Arabidopsis ( Gonzalez et al., 2009; Krizek, 2009; Breuninger and Lenhard, 2010 ) by affecting one or more processes governing leaf growth. Whereas much research has been done on single genes affecting leaf size, the interactions between these growth regulators remain unexplored. So far, only one case of positive epistasis in Arabidopsis leaf growth has been described when a dominant-negative point mutation in DA1, encoding an ubiquitin receptor, is combined with the knock-out of the ENHANCER OF DA1 ( EOD ) 1/BIG BROTHER, coding for an E3 ubiquitin ligase ( Li et al., 2008 ). In this study, we performed a combinatorial screen of transgenic Arabidopsis plants producing larger leaves to identify positive epistatic effects on leaf growth. We aimed to gain further insight in the links between genes controlling growth and the mechanisms driving leaf development. We obtained binary combinations by crossing 13 transgenic lines with an increased leaf size and measured leaf and rosette area of the single and double transgenics. We found that the leaf area of 38% of all combinations was larger than the sum of those of the single mutants, resulting in positive epistatic effects, whereas 23% of the combinations were smaller, showing a negative epistatic effect.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Different individuals of the same species are not usually identical. Humans, for example, have a range of different values for various traits, such as height and weight, and similar variations are seen in other animals and plants. Some of this variation can be explained by the individual animals or plants inheriting different versions of the same gene. Moreover, two or more genes can sometimes interact to produce a bigger ( or smaller ) effect on given trait than would be expected from combining the effects of each gene. This phenomenon is called epistasis. Leaf size in plants is a trait that is controlled by genes and by the environment. Genes can exert an effect by influencing how often the cells in the leaves divide and by influencing their expansion. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a small plant that has been widely studied by plant biologists, numerous genes influence leaf size. Now, in order to explore epistasis in plants, Vanhaeren, Gonzalez et al. have crossbred 13 Arabidopsis mutants that had leaves that were larger than those found in wild-type plants. The resulting offspring each inherited a different pair of mutant genes: one gene via the male pollen, and the other via the female egg cell. About 39% of the offspring plants had leaves that were even bigger than those of its parents. Moreover, in most cases the increase in leaf size was larger than expected. Vanhaeren, Gonzalez et al. found that three of the 13 genes were responsible for the biggest increases in leaf size. Also, some of the biggest increases were caused by plants inheriting two genes that both caused the cells to divide more. Other large increases in leaf size were caused by interactions between a gene affecting cell division and a gene affecting cell expansion. By uncovering combinations of plant genes that increase leaf size, it might be possible to develop agricultural crops with enhanced yields ."}

Here, we investigate molecular mechanisms by which these divergent connections are generated, using dyadic synapses in C. elegans as a model. We report that C. elegans nrx-1/neurexin directs divergent connectivity through differential actions at synapses with partnering neurons and muscles. We show that cholinergic outputs onto neurons are, unexpectedly, located at previously undefined spine-like protrusions from GABAergic dendrites. Both these spine-like features and cholinergic receptor clustering are strikingly disrupted in the absence of nrx-1. Excitatory transmission onto GABAergic neurons, but not neuromuscular transmission, is also disrupted. Our data indicate that NRX-1 located at presynaptic sites specifically directs postsynaptic development in GABAergic neurons. Our findings provide evidence that individual neurons can direct differential patterns of connectivity with their post-synaptic partners through partner-specific utilization of synaptic organizers, offering a novel view into molecular control of divergent connectivity.  Neurons are typically wired into discrete circuits through stereotyped patterns of synaptic connections geared to perform specific functions. Individual neurons within circuits may receive convergent synaptic inputs from multiple classes of presynaptic partnering neurons, and likewise, make divergent synaptic outputs onto distinct postsynaptic targets. We have gained an understanding of some of the core mechanisms that sculpt convergent connectivity through studies of developmental processes such as activity-dependent synapse elimination ( Brown et al., 1976; Campbell and Shatz, 1992; Okawa et al., 2014a; Sanes and Lichtman, 1999; Shatz and Kirkwood, 1984; Walsh and Lichtman, 2003 ). In contrast, the molecular processes controlling the establishment of divergent synaptic connections ( between a single presynaptic partner and multiple postsynaptic target cells ) are not clearly defined ( Okawa et al., 2014b ). Neural circuit models often represent divergent connections as a means for enabling the same signal from an individual presynaptic neuron to reach many different postsynaptic target cells. However, the strength of connections with postsynaptic partners can vary widely, strongly suggesting that presynaptic neurons have the capacity to establish and regulate connections with each postsynaptic target independently. While molecular guidance cues directing axon outgrowth have been well-studied, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for directing target-specific connectivity has remained elusive. A primary mechanism for establishing nascent synapses is through the actions of synaptic adhesion molecules, also known as synaptic organizers ( de Wit and Ghosh, 2016; Missler et al., 2012 ). These organizers are often anchored to the pre- and post-synaptic membranes ( e. g. neurexins, neuroligins, leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins/LRRTMs ) and promote synapse formation through trans-synaptic adhesion and signaling. The importance of these processes in establishing proper neural circuit connectivity is highlighted by the links between mutations in genes encoding these synaptic adhesion/organizing molecules and neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia ( Kim et al., 2008; Reichelt et al., 2012; Rujescu et al., 2009 ). Intriguingly, synaptic organizers are capable of acting in a cell-specific manner to promote synapse formation ( Chen et al., 2017; Siddiqui et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Thus, an exciting possibility is that individual neurons could encode connections with alternate synaptic partners through differential deployment of synaptic organizers. We have investigated this possibility in the motor circuit of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans where individual excitatory cholinergic motor neurons form synapses with both body wall muscles and GABAergic motor neurons. Through a screen for genes that govern the formation of these divergent synaptic connections, we demonstrate that the synaptic organizer nrx-1/neurexin directs the outgrowth of previously uncharacterized dendritic spine-like structures and the formation of synaptic connections with GABAergic neurons, but is not required for synaptic connectivity with muscles. Conversely, genes previously shown to be required for cholinergic connectivity with muscles ( Francis et al., 2005; Gally et al., 2004; Pinan-Lucarr\u00e9 et al., 2014 ) are not required for the formation of synapses onto GABAergic neurons. Our findings demonstrate that cholinergic neurons utilize distinct molecular signals to establish synapses with GABAergic motor neurons versus body wall muscles, thus revealing that a single presynaptic neuron establishes divergent connections by employing parallel molecular strategies for the formation of connections with each postsynaptic partner.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Nervous systems are complex networks of interconnected cells called neurons. These networks vary in size from a few hundred cells in worms, to tens of billions in the human brain. Within these networks, each individual neuron forms connections \u2013 called synapses \u2013 with many others. But these partner neurons are not necessarily alike. In fact, they may be different cell types. How neurons form distinct connections with different partner cells remains unclear. Part of the answer may lie in specialized proteins called cell adhesion molecules. These proteins occur on the cell surface and enable neurons to recognize one another. This helps ensure that the cells form appropriate connections via synapses. Cell adhesion molecules are therefore also known as synaptic organizers. Philbrook et al. have now examined the role of synaptic organizers in wiring up the nervous system of the nematode worm and model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Motor neurons form connections with two types of partner cell: muscle cells and neurons. Philbrook et al. screened C. elegans that have mutations in genes encoding various synaptic organizers. This revealed that a protein called neurexin must be present for motor neurons to form synapses with other neurons. By contrast, neurexin is not required for the same neurons to establish synapses with muscles. Philbrook et al. found that neuron-to-neuron synapses arise at specialized finger-like projections. These resemble the dendritic spines at which synapses form in the brains of mammals, and had not been previously identified in C. elegans. In worms that lack neurexin, these spine-like structures do not form correctly, disrupting the formation of neuron-to-neuron connections. Previous work has implicated neurexin in synapse formation in the mammalian brain. But this is the first study to reveal a role for neurexin in establishing partner-specific synaptic connections. Mutations in synaptic organizers, including neurexin, contribute to disorders of brain development. These include schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Learning more about how neurexin helps establish specific synaptic connections may help us understand how these disorders arise ."}

Here we report the structure of a WRC-Rac1 complex determined by cryo-electron microscopy. Surprisingly, Rac1 is not located at the binding site on the Sra1 subunit of the WRC previously identified by mutagenesis and biochemical data. Rather, it binds to a distinct, conserved site on the opposite end of Sra1. Biophysical and biochemical data on WRC mutants confirm that Rac1 binds to both sites, with the newly identified site having higher affinity and both sites required for WRC activation. Our data reveal that the WRC is activated by simultaneous engagement of two Rac1 molecules, suggesting a mechanism by which cells may sense the density of active Rac1 at membranes to precisely control actin assembly.  Dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton play central roles in cellular processes, ranging from cell migration and adhesion to endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking ( Skau and Waterman, 2015 ). In many of these processes, actin dynamics are spatially and temporally controlled by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) family. These proteins integrate a diverse array of upstream signals and transmit them through their conserved VCA sequence to the Arp2/3 complex, which, in turn, nucleates actin filaments to create branched actin networks at membranes ( Campellone and Welch, 2010; Padrick and Rosen, 2010 ). In most WASP family proteins, the VCA element is inhibited in the resting state. Inhibition is mediated either by autoinhibition within a single polypeptide chain, as in WASP and N-WASP, or by trans-inhibition within large multi-protein assemblies, as in WAVE and WASH ( Rotty et al., 2013 ). Multiple signals, including binding to ligands ( e. g. Rho family GTPases, phosphoinositide lipids and membrane receptors ) and covalent modifications ( e. g. phosphorylation and ubiquitination ), often act cooperatively to relieve inhibition and concomitantly recruit WASP proteins to their sites of action at membranes ( Chen et al., 2014a, 2010; Hao et al., 2013; Lebensohn and Kirschner, 2009; Padrick and Rosen, 2010; Prehoda et al., 2000; Torres and Rosen, 2003; 2006 ). The WASP family members WAVE1, WAVE2 and WAVE3 are essential to actin dynamics needed for normal development and function of most eukaryotic organisms, and are also implicated in many cancers ( Bisi et al., 2013; Lane et al., 2014; Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007; Yanagisawa et al., 2013 ). In cells, each WAVE protein functions exclusively within a 400 kDa, heteropentameric assembly, termed the WAVE Regulatory Complex ( WRC ), which also contains the proteins Sra1, Nap1, Abi2, and HSPC300 ( or their homologs ) ( Stovold et al., 2005 ). Previously, we reported crystal structures of an inhibited WRC assembly containing all five subunits, but lacking the disordered C terminus and SH3 domain of Abi2 and the proline-rich region of WAVE1 ( mini-WRC ) ( Chen et al., 2010 ), and of this assembly bound to a WRC Interacting Receptor Sequence ( WIRS ) motif peptide derived from the adhesion receptor, protocadherin 10 ( Chen et al., 2014a ). The structure revealed that Sra1 and Nap1 form an elongated dimer of about 100 \u00d7 100\u00a0\u00d7200 \u00c5. WAVE1, Abi2 and HSPC300 form a trimer as an elongated 4-helix bundle, which aligns along the long axis of the Sra1/Nap1 dimer ( Figure 1A ). Immediately following the helix bundle, an extended sequence of\u00a0~90 a. a. from WAVE1 \u2018meanders\u2019 across the surface of Sra1 as a loose collection of loops and helices ( the meander region ). The VCA element of WAVE1 is sequestered at the VCA-binding site by multiple interactions between its V and C helices and a group of helices from both Sra1 and the meander region of WAVE1 itself, explaining how WAVE1 is inhibited within the WRC ( Chen et al., 2010 ). The structures also suggested how the WRC might be activated and recruited to membranes by the combined actions of the Rho GTPase Rac1, the acidic phospholipid PIP3, phosphorylation on both Ser and Tyr residues, and membrane receptors containing WIRS motifs. Among these, the GTPase Rac1 functions as a canonical activator, whose direct interaction with the WRC is necessary, and in some reports, sufficient to drive activation ( Chen et al., 2014a; Chen et al., 2010; Eden et al., 2002; Ismail et al., 2009 ). Based on mutagenesis and biochemical data, we previously proposed that Rac1 binds to a conserved surface at one end of Sra1 adjacent to the VCA-binding site ( referred to as the \u2018A Site\u2019 in Figure 1B ). We hypothesized that binding of Rac1 could cause structural changes that propagate through the meander region to the VCA to promote VCA release and consequent activation toward the Arp2/3 complex ( Chen et al., 2010 ). However, in the absence of a WRC-Rac1 complex structure, it remained uncertain exactly how Rac1 binds to and activates the WRC. Here we report the structure of a WRC-Rac1 complex at 7 \u00c5 resolution determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ), together with complementary mutagenesis and biochemical analyses of the complex. Surprisingly, Rac1 is not found on the binding site we predicted previously. Rather, it binds to a conserved site on the opposite end of Sra1. Our biochemical data, including quantitative pull-down, membrane recruitment, and analytical ultracentrifugation ( AUC ) assays with WRC mutants, confirm that both the original site and the new site can bind Rac1, the latter with approximately 40-fold higher affinity. Actin assembly experiments further reveal that both sites contribute to activation of the WRC toward the Arp2/3 complex. These data lead to a model in which maximal WRC activation requires simultaneous engagement of two Rac1 molecules on the membrane. This bivalent activation model suggests a mechanism by which cells may precisely control actin dynamics at membranes by sensing the density of active Rac1 produced by upstream signaling pathways.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Our cells contain a network of filaments made up of a protein called actin. Just like the skeleton that supports our body, the actin \u2018cytoskeleton\u2019 gives a cell its shape and strength. Actin filaments are also critical for many other processes including enabling cells to move and divide. The assembly of actin filaments must be properly controlled so that they are formed at the right time and place within the cell. A complex of proteins known as the WAVE Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) promotes the assembly of actin filaments. The complex contains a region called the VCA, which is able to bind to and activate another protein to make the new actin filaments. The WRC regulates filament assembly by controlling the availability of the VCA in a way that is similar to opening and closing a safe box. When new actin filaments are not needed, the safe box is closed and the VCA is not available. However, when cells need to make new actin filaments, the WRC is opened to release the VCA region so that it is able to bind to the filament-producing protein. Previous studies have shown that a protein called Rac1 acts as a key to open the WRC and trigger actin filament assembly. But it remains unclear how this works. A major obstacle to studying this process is that Rac1 and the WRC only weakly interact with each other, which makes it difficult to capture the interaction under experimental conditions. To overcome this obstacle, Chen et al. tethered a Rac1 molecule to the WRC in order to make the interaction more stable. A technique called cryo-electron microscopy was used to study the three-dimensional shape of this Rac1-WRC complex. Unexpectedly, Rac1 was attached to a different part of the WRC than the site predicted by previous studies. Further experiments showed that Rac1 needs to bind to both of these sites at the same time in order to open the WRC and release VCA, similar to using two keys to open one safe box for increased security. Some cancers, neurological disorders and other diseases can be caused by defects in WRC and Rac1 activity. Therefore, these findings could lead to new ways to treat these conditions in human patients ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nWomen live on average longer than men but have greater levels of late-life morbidity. We have uncovered a substantial sex difference in the pathology of the aging gut in Drosophila. The intestinal epithelium of the aging female undergoes major deterioration, driven by intestinal stem cell ( ISC ) division, while lower ISC activity in males associates with delay or absence of pathology, and better barrier function, even at old ages. Males succumb to intestinal challenges to which females are resistant, associated with fewer proliferating ISCs, suggesting a trade-off between highly active repair mechanisms and late-life pathology in females. Dietary restriction reduces gut pathology in aging females, and extends female lifespan more than male. By genetic sex reversal of a specific gut region, we induced female-like aging pathologies in males, associated with decreased lifespan, but also with a greater increase in longevity in response to dietary restriction.  Women live for longer than do men in most modern societies ( Regan and Partridge, 2013 ) but suffer from higher levels of morbidity later in life ( Abad-D\u00edez et al., 2014; Barnett et al., 2012 ). Sex differences in health during aging are underpinned by differences in patterns of decline in the structure and function of specific tissues. For example, the gut ages differently in men and women, such that many gastrointestinal diseases and cancers are gender-biased ( Chang and Heitkemper, 2002; Kim et al., 2015; Jemal et al., 2011 ). However, the mechanisms underlying sex differences in intestinal pathology are not well understood. Females of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster show substantial gut pathology during aging, which limits female lifespan ( Biteau et al., 2010; Rera et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014 ). Drosophila are mostly post-mitotic as adults, but the gut contains intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) ( Micchelli et al., 2006; Ohlstein et al., 2006 ), and their division drives age-related intestinal hyperplasia ( Biteau et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2008 ). Epithelial barrier function declines during aging, and its failure is predictive of death ( Rera et al., 2012; Clark et al., 2015 ). However, it is not known to what extent males suffer from intestinal pathology during aging; indeed, studies of aging in male Drosophila are generally less common ( Magwere et al., 2004; Partridge et al., 1985; Tu et al., 2002 ), and little is known about tissue-specific sexual dimorphisms in aging phenotypes ( Boyle et al., 2007; Camus et al., 2012; Mackenzie et al., 2011 ). Interestingly, Drosophila females show a much greater longevity response to dietary restriction ( DR ) than do males ( Magwere et al., 2004 ), although the role of the gut in this sex difference has not been investigated. We have uncovered substantial sexual dimorphism in the incidence of gut pathology during aging, with females showing widespread deterioration in epithelial structure and loss of gut barrier function, while males generally maintain both even at very late ages. However, males succumbed to oral bacterial infections to which females were resistant, with female guts containing a higher number of proliferating cells, suggesting a trade-off between gut plasticity and/or repair mechanisms, and old age pathology in females. Gut pathology in aging females\u00a0was ameliorated by DR, suggesting that the greater response of female lifespan to DR may be a consequence of improved gut function. Taking advantage of cell autonomous sex determination in Drosophila, we produced males that had a region of the midgut genetically feminized and we\u00a0found that this region alone showed the female pattern of aging-related pathology and increase in mitotic stem cells. Furthermore, these feminized males also showed a greater increase in lifespan in response to DR, comparable to that seen in females. Males demonstrated higher age-related, systemic inflammation compared to females, and sensitivity to oral bacterial infection, indicative of immune dysfunction, despite better maintenance of gut barrier function. Intriguingly, this points to further sex bias ( es ) in immunity that could contribute to male mortality.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Women live longer than men, and many age-related diseases are more common in one sex than the other. In addition, some treatments that extend the healthy lifespan of laboratory animals are more effective in females than in males. These include dietary restrictions, where food or specific dietary constituants are kept in short supply. Stem cells can help to repair old and damaged tissue because, when they divide, they can form a cell that can specialize into one of several mature cell types. Previous studies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have shown that stem cell activity in the gut affects how long female flies live. Now, Regan et al. have looked in detail at the guts of male and female fruit flies as they age. This revealed that female guts deteriorate as the flies grow old because the stem cells in the gut divide more often and form small tumours. These stem cells help young females to grow and repair their guts, but start to turn against them as they age. In contrast, male guts stay well maintained and do not show the same signs of ageing. Females fed less food had guts that aged more slowly, suggesting they might live longer on a restricted diet because it improves their gut health. Regan et al. then used a genetic trick to make male flies with female guts. These feminized males had more gut tumours than normal males, but they also showed a greater increase in lifespan when placed on a restricted diet, because the poorer condition of their ageing gut meant there was more scope for the diet to improve their health. So if gut deterioration does not limit male lifespan, what do males die of ? Pursuing this question may ultimately help us to understand how human lifespans are affected by sex differences and develop treatments for ageing and age-related diseases that everyone can benefit from ."}

We previously found genetic clearance of senescent cells from progeroid INK-ATTAC mice prevents lipodystrophy. Here we show that primary human senescent fat progenitors secrete activin A and directly inhibit adipogenesis in non-senescent progenitors. Blocking activin A partially restored lipid accumulation and expression of key adipogenic markers in differentiating progenitors exposed to senescent cells. Mouse fat tissue activin A increased with aging. Clearing senescent cells from 18-month-old naturally-aged INK-ATTAC mice reduced circulating activin A, blunted fat loss, and enhanced adipogenic transcription factor expression within 3 weeks. JAK inhibitor suppressed senescent cell activin A production and blunted senescent cell-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis. Eight weeks-treatment with ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved JAK1/2 inhibitor, reduced circulating activin A, preserved fat mass, reduced lipotoxicity, and increased insulin sensitivity in 22-month-old mice. Our study indicates targeting senescent cells or their products may alleviate age-related dysfunction of progenitors, adipose tissue, and metabolism.  A major function of adipose tissue is to store potentially cytotoxic lipids, including fatty acids ( FAs ), as less reactive neutral triglycerides ( TG ) within fat droplets ( Listenberger et al., 2003 ). Lipid storage by adipose tissue appears to constitute a defense against lipotoxicity and metabolic disease ( Wang et al., 2008; Unger and Scherer, 2010; Gustafson et al., 2015; Tchkonia et al., 2010 ). Fat cells turn over throughout life, with generation of new fat cells through differentiation of fat progenitors ( also known as preadipocytes or adipose-derived stem cells ) ( Tchkonia et al., 2013; Spalding et al., 2008; Tchoukalova et al., 2010 ). Adipogenesis is orchestrated by a transcription factor cascade involving the two key regulators, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 ( PPAR\u03b3 ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 ( C/EBP\u03b1 ) ( Wu et al., 1999; Lin and Lane, 1994 ) and their downstream targets, including fatty acid binding protein 4 ( FABP4 ) and perilipin ( PLIN1 ) ( Bernlohr et al., 1997; Sun, 2013 ). Compromised adipogenic capacity can contribute to impaired ability of adipose tissue to store lipids, leading to FA spillover and ectopic lipid accumulation in liver and other sites, insulin resistance, and lipotoxicity ( Garbarino and Sturley, 2009; Slawik and Vidal-Puig, 2006; Tchkonia et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2007 ). By late middle age, capacity for adipogenesis, PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 expression, adipose tissue mass, and metabolic function begin to decline in experimental animals and humans ( Tchkonia et al., 2010; Slawik and Vidal-Puig, 2006; Fink et al., 1983; Tchkonia et al., 2013; Cowie et al., 2006; North and Sinclair, 2012; Palmer et al., 2015; Cartwright et al., 2007; Raguso et al., 2006; Kuk et al., 2009; Cartwright et al., 2010; Tchkonia et al., 2007; Karagiannides et al., 2001; Kirkland et al., 1990 ). This age-related lipodystrophy likely contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction at older ages ( Gustafson et al., 2015; Tchkonia et al., 2010; Tchkonia et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2007; Kuk et al., 2009 ). We hypothesize that cellular senescence could contribute to impaired adipogenesis and age-related lipodystrophy ( Tchkonia et al., 2010 ). Cellular senescence refers to an essentially irreversible arrest of cell proliferation ( Hayflickl and Moorhead, 1961 ). It can be induced by a variety of stresses, including DNA damage, telomere shortening, radiation, chemotherapeutics, and reactive metabolites ( Tchkonia et al., 2013; Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007 ). Senescent cells accumulate in adipose tissue with aging across a number of mammalian species ( Tchkonia et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2015; Stout et al., 2014 ) and secrete an array of cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and growth factors\u2014the senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) ( Copp\u00e9 et al., 2008; Copp\u00e9 et al., 2010 ). Cultures of progenitors isolated from adipose depots of older animals or humans contain senescent cells and exhibit impaired adipogenic capacity, with reduced lipid accumulation and C/EBP\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 expression after exposure to differentiation-inducing stimuli ( Tchkonia et al., 2010; Tchkonia et al., 2007; Park et al., 2005; Mitterberger et al., 2014 ). Senescent cells appear to be able to spread inflammatory activation and perhaps even senescence to nearby non-senescent cells ( Xu et al., 2015; Acosta et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2012 ). In previous work, we used a genetically modified INK-ATTAC ( Cdkn2a /p16Ink4a promoter driven apoptosis through targeted activation of caspase ) mouse model to selectively eliminate Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) positive senescent cells through apoptosis by the administration of AP20187, a drug that induces dimerization of a membrane-bound myristoylated FK506 binding protein fused with caspase 8 ( FKBP\u2013Casp8 ) ( Baker et al., 2011 ). We showed that clearance of senescent cells can delay age-related phenotypes including lordokyphosis and cataract formation, and can actually reverse age-related fat loss in progeroid BubR1H/H animals ( Baker et al., 2011 ), implicating senescent cells as a driver of age-related phenotypes. Furthermore, interleukin-6 ( IL6 ) ( Gustafson and Smith, 2006; Okada et al., 2012 ), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 ( TNF\u03b1 ) ( Tchkonia et al., 2007; Gustafson and Smith, 2006; Okada et al., 2012 ), and interferon \u03b3 ( IFN\u03b3 ) ( McGillicuddy et al., 2009 ) can inhibit adipogenesis in vitro. These factors are among the SASP components in senescent fat progenitors and other senescent cell types ( Tchkonia et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2015; Copp\u00e9 et al., 2008; Copp\u00e9 et al., 2010 ). However, causal links between these paracrine factors and impaired adipogenesis related to cellular senescence have not been demonstrated. We recently reported that the JAK/STAT ( Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription ) pathway plays a role in regulating the SASP ( Xu et al., 2015 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that JAK inhibition might rescue impaired adipogenesis due to senescent cells and thus preserve fat mass and metabolic function in older individuals. We report here that senescent fat progenitors impede differentiation of non-senescent progenitors, in part by secreting activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor superfamily, which can inhibit adipogenesis and interfere with stem cell and progenitor function ( Zaragosi et al., 2010 ). Eliminating senescent cells from naturally-aged INK-ATTAC mice reduced activin A and increased adipose tissue C/EBP\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3. JAK pathway inhibition suppressed production of activin A by senescent fat progenitors and partially rescued adipogenic capacity both in vitro and in vivo. JAK inhibition in aged mice reduced lipotoxicity and increased insulin sensitivity. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of age-related progenitor dysfunction, fat loss, and metabolic dysfunction, as well as potential therapeutic avenues for preventing or alleviating these common conditions.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The likelihood of developing metabolic diseases such as diabetes increases with age. This is, in part, because the cells within fat and other tissues become less sensitive to the hormone insulin as people and other animals get older. Also, the stem cells that give rise to new, insulin-responsive fat cells become dysfunctional with increasing age. This is related to the accumulation of \u201csenescent\u201d cells, which, unlike normal fat cell progenitors, release molecules that are toxic to nearby and distant cells. Xu, Palmer et al. have now investigated if senescent cells interfere with the activity of stem cells from human fat tissue, and if getting rid of these senescent cells might restore the normal activity and insulin responsiveness of aged fat tissue. The experiments revealed that human senescent fat cell progenitors release a protein called activin A, which impedes the normal function of stem cells and fat tissue. Additionally, older mice had higher levels of activin A in both their blood and fat tissue than young mice. Xu, Palmer et al. then analyzed older mice that had been engineered to have senescent fat cells that could be triggered to essentially kill themselves when the mice were treated with a drug. Eliminating the senescent cells from these mice led to lower levels of activin A and more fat tissue ( due to improved stem cell capacity to become fully functional fat cells ) that expressed genes required for insulin responsiveness. This showed that senescent cells are a cause of age-related fat tissue loss and metabolic disease in older mice. Next, Xu, Palmer et al. treated older mice with drugs called JAK inhibitors, which they found reduce the production of activin A by senescent cells isolated from fat tissue. After two months of treatment, the levels of activin A in the blood and in fat tissue were indeed reduced. The fat tissue in treated mice also showed fewer features associated with the development of diabetes than the fat tissue of untreated mice. As such, these results paralleled those after selectively eliminating the senescent cells. Together these findings suggest that JAK inhibitors or drugs ( called senolytics ) that selectively eliminate senescent cells may have clinical benefits in treating age-related conditions such as diabetes and stem cell dysfunction ."}

To investigate these interactions in a simple microbiome, we introduced E. coli into an experimental community based on a cheese rind and identified the differences in E. coli\u2019s genetic requirements for growth in interactive and non-interactive contexts using Random Barcode Transposon Sequencing ( RB-TnSeq ) and RNASeq. Genetic requirements varied among pairwise growth conditions and between pairwise and community conditions. Our analysis points to mechanisms by which growth conditions change as a result of increasing community complexity and suggests that growth within a community relies on a combination of pairwise and higher-order interactions. Our work provides a framework for using the model organism E. coli as a readout to investigate microbial interactions regardless of the genetic tractability of members of the studied ecosystem.  Microorganisms rarely grow as single isolated species but rather as part of diverse microbial communities. In these communities, bacteria, archaea, protists, viruses and fungi can coexist and perform complex functions impacting biogeochemical cycles and human health ( Falkowski et al., 2008; Flint et al., 2012 ). Deciphering microbial growth principles within a community is challenging due to the intricate interactions between microorganisms, and between microorganisms and their environment. While interest in microbial communities has dramatically increased, our understanding of microbial interactions within communities is lagging significantly behind our ability to describe the composition of a given community. Approaches relying on 16S rDNA\u00a0sequencing analyses of microbial communities can\u00a0be\u00a0used to reconstruct ecosystem networks and detect patterns of co-occurrence to infer general interactions such as competition, mutualism and commensalism ( Faust and Raes, 2012 ). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions remain largely uncharacterized. Further, the way in which these interactions are organized within a community, such as whether they consist of predominantly pairwise or higher-order interactions, is even less clear. A more precise understanding of microbial interactions, their underlying mechanisms, and how these interactions are structured within a community, are all necessary to elucidate the principles by which a community is shaped. In this study, we combine genome-scale genetic and transcriptomic approaches within an experimentally tractable model microbial community to begin to address these questions. Genome-scale approaches, such as transposon mutagenesis coupled to next-generation sequencing ( TnSeq approaches ) have been successfully used to quantify the contribution and thus the importance of individual genes to a given phenotype ( van Opijnen and Camilli, 2013 ). These techniques use a pooled library of transposon insertion mutants whose frequency is measured to identify genes important for growth in a given condition. Recently, the generation and introduction of unique random barcodes into transposon mutant libraries made this approach more high-throughput, enabling screens of important genes across hundreds of conditions and for numerous genetically tractable microorganisms ( Wetmore et al., 2015; Price et al., 2018 ). To investigate the genetic basis of microbial interactions, we have adapted this approach to identify and compare genetic requirements in single-species ( non-interactive ) and multi-species ( interactive ) conditions. We used a large and diverse transposon library previously generated in the genetically-tractable model bacterium E. coli K12 ( Wetmore et al., 2015 ) to characterize the genetic requirements of interactions within a model community based on the rind of cheese ( Wolfe et al., 2014 ). The fact that the E. coli genome has undergone extensive characterization can help more effectively interpret the genetic requirements introduced by growth within communities. Although E. coli K12 is not a typical endogenous species of this particular microbiome, non-pathogenic E. coli strains can be found in raw milk and raw-milk cheese ( Trm\u010di\u0107 et al., 2016 ). Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli 0157:H7 and non-0157 pathogenic E. coli species are common invaders of the cheese environment and can survive during cheese making causing mild to life-threatening symptoms after ingestion ( Coia et al., 2001; Montet et al., 2009; Frank et al., 1977 ). Using the E. coli transposon library, we ( i ) identified the set of genes important for growth alone in the cheese environment, ( ii ) identified the set of genes important for growth in pairwise conditions with each individual community member and ( iii ) identified the set of genes important for growth in the presence of the complete community. Characterization of the functions or pathways associated with growth in interactive versus non-interactive conditions were\u00a0then used to infer the biological processes involved in interactions within the model microbiome. Additionally, we compared the set of genes important for growth in pairwise conditions with the ones important for growth in a community to investigate how microbial interactions change depending on the complexity of the interactive context. We also performed a similar RB-TnSeq analysis during non-interactive and interactive conditions using a transposon library we generated in the cheese-endogenous species Pseudomonas psychrophila JB418. Finally, we measured changes in the transcriptional profile of E. coli during growth alone, growth in pairwise conditions, and within the community using RNAseq as a complementary approach to RB-TnSeq in defining microbial interactions. This analysis revealed a deep reorganization of gene expression whenever E. coli is in the presence of other species. This work revealed numerous interactions between species, such as metabolic competition for iron and nitrogen, as well as cross-feeding from fungal partners for certain amino acids. Our analysis showed that most of the metabolic interactions ( competition and cross-feeding ) observed in pairwise conditions are maintained and amplified by the addition of all partners in the community context. However, around half of the genetic requirements observed in pairwise conditions were no longer apparent in the community, suggesting that higher-order interactions emerge in a community.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Microorganisms live almost everywhere on Earth. Whether it is rainforest soil or human skin, each environment hosts a unique community of microbes, referred to as its microbiome. There can be upwards of hundreds of species in a single microbiome, and these species can interact in a variety of ways; some cooperate, others compete, and some can kill other species. Deciphering the nature of these interactions is crucial to knowing how microbiomes work, and how they might be manipulated, for example, to improve human health. Yet studies into these interactions have proven difficult, not least because most of the species involved are difficult to grow in controlled experiments. One environment that is home to a rich community of microbes is the outer surface of cheese, known as the cheese rind. The cheese rind microbiome is a useful system for laboratory experiments, because it is relatively easy to replicate and its microbes can be grown on their own or in combinations with others. To explore the nature of interactions in microbiomes, Morin et al. have now grown a large collection of E. coli mutants as members of simplified microbiomes based on the cheese rind. The mutant bacteria were grown on cheese either alone, paired with one other species, or alongside a community of three species. The aim was to see which mutants grew poorly when other species were present, thus allowing Morin et al. to identify specific genes that are important for interactions within the experimental microbiomes. Even in these simplified microbiomes, the microbes interacted in a variety of ways. Some microbes competed with E. coli for elements like iron and nitrogen; others cooperated by sharing the building blocks needed to make larger molecules. Many of the interactions that happened when E. coli was paired with one species were not seen when more species were added to the community. Similarly, some interactions were only seen when E. coli was grown alongside a community of microbes, and not when it was paired with any of the three species on their own. These findings show that complex interactions are present even in a simplified microbiome. This experimental approach can now be applied to other microbiomes that can be grown in the laboratory to examine whether the patterns of interactions seen are generalizable or specific to the cheese rind system ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe gene regulatory network ( GRN ) is the central decision\u2010making module of the cell. We have developed a theory called Buffered Qualitative Stability ( BQS ) based on the hypothesis that GRNs are organised so that they remain robust in the face of unpredictable environmental and evolutionary changes. BQS makes strong and diverse predictions about the network features that allow stable responses under arbitrary perturbations, including the random addition of new connections. We show that the GRNs of E. coli, M. tuberculosis, P. aeruginosa, yeast, mouse, and human all verify the predictions of BQS. BQS explains many of the small- and large\u2010scale properties of GRNs, provides conditions for evolvable robustness, and highlights general features of transcriptional response. BQS is severely compromised in a human cancer cell line, suggesting that loss of BQS might underlie the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells, and highlighting a possible sequence of GRN alterations concomitant with cancer initiation.  At every level of organisation, biological entities, such as genes, proteins and cells, function as ensembles. Interaction networks are therefore a fundamental feature of biological systems, and a vast amount of analysis exploring the organisation of biological networks has been performed ( Milo et al., 2002; Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Alon, 2006; Buchanan et al., 2010 ). This analysis has provided interesting insights into the features of these networks ( Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Brock et al., 2009; Tyson and Nov\u00e1k, 2010; Ferrell et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011; Cowan et al., 2012 ), and has led to new methodologies for characterizing their topologies. However, one might argue that this work has had less impact on our understanding of the reasons underlying the network topologies observed and on the possible selective pressures leading to the emergence of common network features. Here we present a simple theory, Buffered Qualitative Stability ( BQS ), motivated by biological robustness, which has strong explanatory power and provides a number of hard, readily verifiable predictions for the topological structure of interaction networks, at both global and local scales. Besides leading to new predictions\u2014that are consistently verified\u2014BQS provides a theoretical justification for the ubiquitousness of network features already observed. BQS is therefore an important step in providing a general mechanistic explanation for the overall structure of GRNs at different scales and in shedding new light on previous observations. Robustness is a remarkable feature of living organisms allowing them to tolerate a wide variety of contingencies, such as DNA damage, limitations in nutrient availability, or exposure to toxins ( Lopez-Maury et al., 2008; MacNeil and Walhout, 2011 ). Although much is now known about how cells respond to particular stresses or environmental cues, little is known about how cells remain stable and respond appropriately whatever the contingency. Over evolutionary time it is also advantageous for organisms to be robust to genetic changes, including those that occur as a consequence of the shuffling of genes during sexual reproduction. In order for cells to be fully robust, changes to any of the thousands of individual quantitative parameters\u2014for example the concentration of a transcription factor or its affinity for its cognate DNA sequence\u2014cannot be critical because contingencies may cause these to change. We propose that the robustness of a biological system should therefore depend on qualitative, not quantitative, features of its response to perturbation. Robustness is a complex and fundamental feature that can be formalised in many ways ( Jen, 2003; Silva-Rocha and de Lorenzo, 2010 ). Features commonly associated with robustness include resistance to noise, redundancy and error-correction. Here we will focus on an important component of robustness: the ability of a system at equilibrium to respond to a perturbation by returning to its equilibrium state. Such a feature, generally called \u2018stability\u2019, is essential to allow a system to properly operate in noisy conditions and withstand unexpected environmental challenges. This type of robustness has been studied before ( Quirk and Ruppert, 1965; Puccia and Levins, 1985 ) and has been applied to economics ( Quirk and Ruppert, 1965; Hale et al., 1999 ), ecology ( May, 1973a; Puccia and Levins, 1985 ) and chemistry ( Tyson, 1975 ). However, this notion has never been used to predict network features beyond simple topological properties required by the \u2018rules\u2019 that allow such stringent robustness and has not previously been applied to molecular cell biology, or the evolutionary pressures shaping the behaviours of living organisms. Transcriptional regulation plays a central role in the behaviour of cells in response to environmental cues and is aberrant in many diseases ( Lee and Young, 2013 ). Moreover, networks representing transcriptional interactions have been derived for diverse organisms. These networks, termed \u2018gene regulatory networks\u2019 ( GRNs ), comprise directed links between pairs of genes. For a given pair of linked genes, one encodes a transcription factor ( TF ) that regulates the expression of the other ( Buchanan et al., 2010 ). Figure 1 shows the GRN of Escherichia coli, with TFs coloured red and the arrows colour-coded according to the number of genes regulated by the source TF. Systematic network analysis of GRNs is possible because comprehensive and high quality GRN datasets are available for different organisms ( Lee et al., 2002; Harbison et al., 2004; Luscombe et al., 2004; MacIsaac et al., 2006; Galan-Vasquez et al., 2011; Sanz et al., 2011; Garber et al., 2012; Gerstein et al., 2012; Salgado et al., 2012 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 02863. 003Figure 1. The E. coli GRN. The E. coli GRN derived from Salgado et al. ( 2012 ) using two evidence codes. Genes that are reported to regulate transcriptionally at least one other gene, that is transcription factors ( TFs ), are represented as red circles; the other genes are represented by blue circles. Arrows indicate a transcriptional interaction from the TF to the target gene. The arrows are colour-coded according to the number of genes regulated by the source TF. Note the logarithmic scale in the colour coding. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02863. 003 Here we consider the hypothesis that to confer robustness and promote evolvability, GRNs must be stable to changes in interaction parameters and also stable to the addition of new regulatory links, that is to changes in the structure of the GRN itself. The type of robustness that we hypothesize ensures that the transcriptional state of a cell remains largely stable in response to random perturbations. We show that published GRNs, including those of E. coli, M. tuberculosis, P. aeruginosa, S. cerevisiae, mouse and humans are robust in this way, a property we term \u2018Buffered Qualitative Stability\u2019 ( BQS ). Remarkably, the only published GRN of a cancer cell line deviates strongly from BQS, suggesting that the loss of BQS may play an important role in cancer.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The genomes of living organisms consist of thousands of genes, which produce proteins that perform many essential functions. Cells receive signals from both their internal and external environments, and respond by changing how they express their genes. This allows a cell to make the right amount of different proteins when needed. The proteins that a cell produces can then, in turn, influence how the cell's genes are expressed. This set of interactions between genes and proteins is called a gene regulatory network, and is akin to a computer program that the cell runs to define its behaviour. At present, we understand very little about why these networks take on the forms seen in living cells. A remarkable feature of living organisms is their ability to withstand an extremely wide variety of predicaments, such as DNA damage, physical trauma or exposure to toxins. This ability, generally called robustness, requires a cell to rapidly activate different gene sets and maintain their activity for as long as necessary. However, very little is known about how cells are programmed to respond appropriately, whatever happens, and keep themselves in a stable state. Albergante et al. propose that a fully robust gene regulatory network should be able to stabilize itself. This means that the robustness of a gene regulatory network should only depend on how it is wired up, and not on quantitative changes to any features that may change unpredictably\u2014for example the concentration of a protein. By analysing data that is already available about gene regulatory networks in a wide selection of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, Albergante et al. show that all known gene regulatory networks are wired up in a way that any quantitative change to the network will not cause the state of network to change. In addition, gene regulatory networks tend to remain stable even if new regulatory links are randomly added. Albergante et al. call this property Buffered Qualitative Stability ( BQS ) : the network is qualitatively stable because its state does not change when the activity of particular regulatory links in the network changes, and it is buffered against its stability being compromised by the random addition of new links. Albergante et al. also found that the gene regulatory network of a cancer cell does not match up with the predictions of BQS, suggesting that the robustness of the network is compromised in these cells. This could explain why cancer cells are able to easily change their characteristics in response to changes in the environment. In addition, using BQS to analyse the gene regulatory network of bacteria such as E. coli reveals points in the network that, if disrupted, would make the network unstable, potentially harming the cell. Therefore, in the future, an understanding of BQS could help efforts to design new drugs to treat a range of infections and diseases ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nISWI-family nucleosome remodeling enzymes need the histone H4 N-terminal tail to mobilize nucleosomes. Here we mapped the H4-tail binding pocket of ISWI. Surprisingly the binding site was adjacent to but not overlapping with the docking site of an auto-regulatory motif, AutoN, in the N-terminal region ( NTR ) of ISWI, indicating that AutoN does not act as a simple pseudosubstrate as suggested previously. Rather, AutoN cooperated with a hitherto uncharacterized motif, termed AcidicN, to confer H4-tail sensitivity and discriminate between DNA and nucleosomes. A third motif in the NTR, ppHSA, was functionally required in vivo and provided structural stability by clamping the NTR to Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain. This configuration is reminiscent of Chd1 even though Chd1 contains an unrelated NTR. Our results shed light on the intricate structural and functional regulation of ISWI by the NTR and uncover surprising parallels with Chd1.  Eukaryotic cells package their DNA into chromatin. Chromatin organization allows cells to compact, protect and regulate their genomes. Nucleosomes are the primary building blocks of chromatin. These particles consist of\u00a0~150 bp of DNA that wrap almost twice around an octamer of histones. Nucleosomal DNA, however, is not accessible to most nuclear factors. Nature therefore evolved ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes that can alter the position or the structure of nucleosomes as necessary. Numerous remodeling complexes with distinct activities are active in any cell. Some move nucleosomes along DNA, eject histones or exchange them for histone variants, and some can even perform several of these activities ( Zhou et al., 2016 ). How the various remodelers are regulated in response to cellular needs is not well understood. Several remodelers, for instance, respond to post-translational modifications present on histones ( Swygert and Peterson, 2014 ). Others are directly regulated by post-translational modifications ( Kim et al., 2010 ) or react to small signaling molecules ( Zhao et al., 1998 ). Cells also adjust the subunit composition of remodeling complexes during development ( Lessard et al., 2007 ). All these examples indicate exquisite levels of controls exerted over remodeling complexes. The fact that mutations in subunits of human remodeling factors strongly associate with and in some cases drive cancers underscores the necessity to regulate remodeler activity ( Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015; Garraway and Lander, 2013 ). Remodelers of the ISWI family \u2013 like most other remodelers \u2013 can reposition nucleosomes along DNA in a process termed nucleosome sliding. ISWI\u2019s activity is directly regulated by the histone H4 N-terminal tail and by DNA that flanks the nucleosome, so called linker DNA. The regulation imposed by these epitopes has direct consequences for the biological output of ISWI remodelers. By measuring the length of linker DNA, ISWI can generate arrays of evenly spaced nucleosomes ( Lieleg et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2006; Yamada et al., 2011 ), a characteristic feature of chromatin. Arrays of nucleosomes can further compact. In the compacted state, the histone H4 N-terminal tail of one nucleosome contacts the acidic patch formed by H2A and H2B of a neighboring nucleosome ( Luger et al., 1997; Dorigo et al., 2004 ). This interaction sequesters the H4 tail, which now is no longer available for binding to and stimulating the activity of ISWI. Thus, ISWI\u2019s activity on the compacted chromatin would decrease, ensuring the unidirectionality of the reaction. This process is in line with the importance of some ISWI complexes in heterochromatin biology ( Bozhenok et al., 2002 ). How ISWI senses the H4 tail is largely unknown. Evidence points to the ATPase domain of ISWI directly binding the H4 tail ( Racki et al., 2014; Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013 ), consistent with the tail directly influencing catalytic reaction steps ( Clapier et al., 2001; Dang et al., 2006 ). However, a domain at the C-terminal side of ISWI, the HAND-SANT-SLIDE ( HSS ) domain, has been implicated in binding the H4 tail as well ( Boyer et al., 2004; Gr\u00fcne et al., 2003 ). Another layer of regulation is imposed by the non-catalytic subunit termed ACF1, which associates with ISWI and sequesters the H4 tail under certain conditions ( Hwang et al., 2014 ). ISWI recognizes amino acids R17H18R19 within the H4 tail, which are part of a stretch of amino acids called basic patch ( Fazzio et al., 2005; Hamiche et al., 2001; Clapier et al., 2002 ). Notably, ISWI contains an identical motif, here called AutoN. Mutation of AutoN\u2019s two arginines to alanines ( referred to as 2RA ) increased the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and nucleosome sliding, and suppressed the dependence of ISWI\u2019s ATPase and sliding activities on the H4 tail. According to the current model, AutoN directly binds to and blocks the H4-tail binding site, acting as a gatekeeper for the H4 tail. This model necessitates a conformational change of the NTR to allow binding of H4 ( Hwang et al., 2014; Clapier and Cairns, 2012 ). Indeed, a conformational change could be traced to AutoN upon nucleic acid binding ( Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013 ). Of note, the 2RA mutation diminished but did not abolish the H4-tail dependency, implicating also other regions in the H4 recognition process ( Clapier and Cairns, 2012 ). The AutoN motif is embedded in a structurally and functionally poorly characterized domain referred to as the N-terminal region ( NTR ). Besides AutoN, the NTR contains additional motifs: an acidic region that we termed AcidicN, the \u2018post-post-helicase-SANT-associated' ( ppHSA ) motif, so named because it follows the post-HSA motif in remodelers of the Snf2 family ( Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013; Szerlong et al., 2008 ), and a weakly conserved AT-hook ( Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013; Aravind and Landsman, 1998 ). Their functions remain unknown. Here, we systematically interrogated the functions of all conserved motifs within the NTR by mutagenesis and a series of quantitative biochemical assays in vitro and in vivo. We paid particular attention to probe for possible crosstalk between these motifs and the H4 tail to understand its recognition process. Using protein crosslinking followed by mass spectrometry and protein structural modeling we obtained information about the general structural architecture of the NTR-ATPase module. With similar approaches, we mapped the H4-tail binding site. We interpret our results within a unified structural and functional framework for the combined inhibition of ISWI by the NTR and recognition of the histone H4 tail. Contrary to current models, we propose that AutoN does not occlude the binding pocket of the H4 tail and that inhibition by AutoN involves a more elaborate mechanism than simple mimicry of the H4 basic patch.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: In the cells of animals, plants and other eukaryotes, DNA wraps tightly around proteins called histones to form structures known as nucleosomes that resemble beads on a string. When nucleosomes are sufficiently close to each other they interact and clump together, which compacts the DNA and prevents the genes in that stretch of DNA being activated. But how do cells mobilize their nucleosomes ? A nucleosome remodeling enzyme called ISWI can slide nucleosomes along DNA. ISWI becomes active when it interacts with a \u2018tail\u2019 region of a histone protein called H4. However, the H4 tail prefers to interact with neighboring nucleosomes instead of with ISWI. Therefore when ISWI slides a nucleosome close to another one, the H4 tail of the nucleosome binds instead to its new neighbor so that ISWI cannot continue to slide. By this mechanism, ISWI is proposed to pile up nucleosomes, which subsequently compact, leading to the inactivation of this part of the genome. To investigate how ISWI recognizes the H4 tail, Ludwigsen et al. mapped where the H4 tail binds to ISWI by combining the biochemical methods of cross-linking and mass spectrometry. In addition, mutagenesis experiments identified a new motif in the enzyme that is essential for recognizing the H4 tail. In the absence of the nucleosome, this motif \u2013 called AcidicN \u2013 works with a neighboring motif called AutoN to keep ISWI in an inactive state. The two motifs also work together to enable ISWI to distinguish between nucleosomes and DNA. Further evidence suggests that other remodeling enzymes have similar regulation mechanisms; therefore this method of controlling nucleosome remodeling may have been conserved throughout evolution. Further studies are now needed to detect the shape changes that occur in ISWI as it recognizes the histone tail and work out how this leads to nucleosome remodeling. Inside cells, ISWI is usually found within large complexes that consist of many proteins. It therefore also remains to be discovered whether the proteins in these complexes impose additional layers of regulation and complexity on the activity of ISWI ."}

Here, we used next-generation RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) to produce a quantitative, whole genome characterization of gene expression for the major excitatory neuronal classes of the hippocampus; namely, granule cells and mossy cells of the dentate gyrus, and pyramidal cells of areas CA3, CA2, and CA1. Moreover, for the canonical cell classes of the trisynaptic loop, we profiled transcriptomes at both dorsal and ventral poles, producing a cell-class- and region-specific transcriptional description for these populations. This dataset clarifies the transcriptional properties and identities of lesser-known cell classes, and moreover reveals unexpected variation in the trisynaptic loop across the dorsal-ventral axis. We have created a public resource, Hipposeq ( http://hipposeq. janelia. org ), which provides analysis and visualization of these data and will act as a roadmap relating molecules to cells, circuits, and computation in the hippocampus.  Gene expression profiling can be a powerful tool to understand the functionality and organization of cells and networks. For example, by relating the specific enriched or depleted genes to their corresponding ontologies in a given population, functional hypotheses can be generated at the intrinsic level ( e. g., voltage-gated channel subunits ) and network level ( e. g., ligand-receptor interactions ). A different approach, agnostic to functional correlates of genes, can be taken by using gene expression profiles as a means to genetically delineate different populations of cells, either across classes or within a given class. In this way, gene expression profiling simultaneously clarifies complementary aspects of molecular, cellular, and circuit properties of cells. Transcriptional profiling in the mouse brain is becoming a powerful tool in neuroscience, owing to a host of complementary innovations and technologies. A variety of transgenic mice have emerged over the last decade ( Gong et al., 2003; 2007; Taniguchi et al., 2011 ), which enables access to genetically defined populations of neurons, and a variety of techniques now exist for purifying labeled cells from surrounding tissue ( Okaty et al., 2011a ) to obtain cell-class-specific transcriptomes ( Okaty et al., 2011b ). Although large-scale, quantitative gene expression profiling across neurons has typically been performed by microarray ( Belgard et al., 2011; Siegert et al., 2012; Sugino et al., 2006 ), more recently the technically superior RNA-seq ( Shin et al., 2014 ) is finding application in the neurosciences ( Cembrowski et al., 2016; Zeisel et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014 ). Complementing these quantitative profiling methods is the mouse Allen Brain Atlas ( ABA ) ( Lein et al., 2007 ), providing histological information from in situ hybridization ( ISH ) assays. A combination of these techniques has been previously applied to study principal cells in the hippocampus. Microarray work has been used to study CA1 pyramidal cells ( Kamme et al., 2003;\u00a0Sugino et al., 2006 ) as well as cells\u00a0of\u00a0the trisynaptic loop ( Deguchi et al., 2011; Greene et al., 2009; Lein et al., 2004; Nakamura et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2001 ). Mining of the ABA has revealed molecularly defined subregions in multiple principal cell classes ( Dong et al., 2009; Fanselow and Dong, 2010; Thompson et al., 2008 ). Most recently, RNA-seq work has been used to study CA1 pyramidal cells ( Cembrowski et al., 2016; Zeisel et al., 2015 ). This work has helped to identify genetic differences within and across regions and as well revealed differences within canonical neuronal populations. Despite this extensive investigation, many aspects of the hippocampal transcriptome remain unresolved or warrant further investigation. Previous transcriptional profiling has predominantly focused on CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells; markedly less work has examined DG granule cells and CA2 pyramidal cells ( but see Fanselow and Dong, 2010; Lein et al., 2004; 2005 ) and no profiling has been performed for DG mossy cells. Additionally, recent work has suggested that DG granule cells may be a heterogeneous population along the dorsal-ventral axis ( Fanselow and Dong, 2010 ), but this has not been systematically investigated. Perhaps most importantly, the technical superiority of RNA-seq may reveal governing organizational rules that may have not been resolved with ISH or microarray ( Cembrowski et al., 2016 ), suggesting that a systematic RNA-seq based approach may provide unparalleled insight into the transcriptional organization of the hippocampus. Here, we manually purified labeled excitatory cell populations from microdissected hippocampal regions, and used RNA-seq in combination with histological information from ABA to characterize gene expression quantitatively and histologically. This approach enabled analysis of hippocampal gene expression in a cell-class- and region-specific manner. We use this approach to examine both previously characterized and novel transcriptomes, and to understand the organizational schemes of gene expression within and across neuronal populations. These data and analysis tools are publicly available ( http://hipposeq. janelia. org ), enabling users to examine gene expression at multiple levels of granularity in the hippocampus\u00a0and providing a molecular blueprint to predict and investigate phenotypes at cellular, systems, and behavioral levels.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Both mouse and human brains are made up of many millions of cells called neurons that are interconnected to form circuits. These neurons are not all the same, because different classes of neurons express different complements of genes. Neurons that express similar genes tend to look and act alike, whereas neurons that express different genes tend to be dissimilar. Cembrowski et al. have used a technique called next-generation RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) to determine which genes are expressed in groups of neurons that represent the main cell types found in a part of the brain called the hippocampus. This brain region is important for memory, and was chosen because the location and appearance of the main cell types in the hippocampus were already well understood. The approach revealed that the main types of neurons in the mouse hippocampus are all very different from each other in terms of gene expression, and that even neurons of the same type can exhibit large differences across the hippocampus. Cembrowski et al. created a website that will allow other researchers to easily navigate, analyze, and visualize gene expression data in these populations of neurons. Future work could next make use of recent technological advances to analyze gene expression in individual neurons, rather than groups of cells, to provide an even more detailed picture. It is also hoped that understanding the differences in gene expression will guide examination of how the hippocampus contributes to memory and what goes wrong in diseases that affect this region of the brain ."}

The branched character of their respiratory chains allows bacteria to do so by providing a great metabolic and regulatory flexibility. Here, we show that the native localization of the nitrate reductase, a major respiratory complex under anaerobiosis in Escherichia coli, is submitted to tight spatiotemporal regulation in response to metabolic conditions via a mechanism using the transmembrane proton gradient as a cue for polar localization. These dynamics are critical for controlling the activity of nitrate reductase, as the formation of polar assemblies potentiates the electron flux through the complex. Thus, dynamic subcellular localization emerges as a critical factor in the control of respiration in bacteria.  Respiration is an essential process for most living organisms. The free energy derived from oxidation of reducing equivalents generated by cell metabolism or taken up from the environment is converted into a protonmotive force ( pmf ) across a membrane that is used, among many processes, to drive adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Although oxygen is the most common terminal electron acceptor of respiratory chains, prokaryotes can make use of alternative acceptors in anoxic environments, such as nitrogen oxides, elemental sulfur and sulfur oxyanions, organic N-oxides, etc. In eukaryotes, respiration is confined to a specific organelle, the mitochondrion and more specifically to its inner membrane which displays remarkably intricate ultra-structural features that impact the respiratory output ( Cogliati et al., 2013 ). Respiration involves multimeric membrane-embedded oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) complexes which bear several metal cofactors through which electrons are transported. The organization of OXPHOS complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane has been the subject of intense debate during the last decade after the discovery of supramolecular assemblies by the landmark study of Sch\u00e4gger in 2000 ( Sch\u00e4gger and Pfeiffer, 2000 ), later substantiated by electron microscopy studies ( for a review, see Vonck and Schafer, 2009 ). Plasticity of the almost linear mitochondrial OXPHOS chain is ensured by a dynamic equilibrium between isolated complexes and supramolecular assemblies which is, in turn, influenced by both specific lipids and stabilizing factors ( Zhang et al., 2002; Ikeda et al., 2013 ). Such an equilibrium is likely beneficial for the function of the mitochondrion allowing the cell to respond to cellular and environmental cues. Moreover, the extraordinarily low degradation rate of OXPHOS complexes in mitochondria ( Price et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2013 ) reinforces the idea that the dynamic association into supercomplexes adds an effective switch to control electron flows in response to environmental changes ( Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013 ). The flexibility of energy metabolism is also critical for the adaptation of a number of prokaryotes to varying environments ( Unden et al., 2014 ). The utilization of modular OXPHOS chains confers flexibility depending on the available energy source or terminal electron acceptor but also allows modulation of the resulting pmf. So far, the adjustment of respiration to varying environments in prokaryotes is considered to be the result of an intricate transcriptional regulation network that controls the expression of OXPHOS complexes with varying electrogenic capacities. At the same time, there is cumulative evidence for an elaborate spatial organization of macromolecules in bacterial cells. We thus hypothesized that the OXPHOS process could be regulated through the dynamic subcellular localization of complexes in response to the metabolic demand. Here, we investigate the native localization of a major OXPHOS complex under anoxic conditions, the quinol oxidizing nitrate reductase complex from the gut bacterium Escherichia coli, and its dynamics upon changes in the environment by real-time fluorescence imaging in live cells.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Respiration occurs at different levels: the body, the organ, and the cells. At the cellular level, it is a molecular process that produces a high-energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) using the biochemical energy stored in sugars, fatty acids, and other nutrients. Along with the ATP, this process also provides another source of energy to the cell: an electrochemical gradient across the membrane used for a range of processes ranging from the transport of molecules and ions to cell motility. In order to thrive, cells need to quickly respond to cues from the environment or elsewhere in the cell. A cell must therefore have the ability to increase or decrease cellular respiration and the production of ATP to ensure it has an appropriate supply of energy. In bacteria, the protein complexes responsible for cellular respiration are embedded in the cell membrane. In the past decade, research has suggested that large molecules are arranged in a specific way throughout the bacterial cell, which directly influences how they work. Alberge et al. tested this idea by studying the localization of a respiratory complex called nitrate reductase\u2014which is important for generating energy in the absence of oxygen\u2014through the introduction of a fluorescent marker tagged to the complex in the cell membrane of a rod-shaped bacterium called Escherichia coli. This allowed the complex to be tracked when the cells were viewed using a microscope. The experiments revealed that the location of the complex varies depending on how much energy the cell requires. For example, when the cells are in an oxygen-poor environment, the nitrate reductase complex moves towards the poles at each end of the bacterial cells. This allows the cells to produce ATP more efficiently through respiration of nitrate. Alberge et al. show that a \u2018proton gradient\u2019, caused by positively charged hydrogen ions moving through the cell membrane as the result of respiration, controls where the complexes are located in the membrane. Alberge et al. 's findings provide experimental support that dynamic localization of respiratory complexes plays an important role in controlling respiration in bacteria. The next challenge will be to identify the genes that influence the distribution of respiratory complexes throughout the cell, which may help to explain how bacterial cells have adapted to specific environments ."}

However, their function remains largely elusive. Here, we show that Nup98-HoxA9, a fusion between Nup98 and the homeobox transcription factor HoxA9, forms nuclear aggregates that frequently associate with facultative heterochromatin. We demonstrate that stable expression of Nup98-HoxA9 in mouse embryonic stem cells selectively induces the expression of Hox cluster genes. Genome-wide binding site analysis revealed that Nup98-HoxA9 is preferentially targeted and accumulated at Hox cluster regions where the export factor Crm1 is originally prebound. In addition, leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1, disassembled nuclear Nup98-HoxA9 dots, resulting in the loss of chromatin binding of Nup98-HoxA9 and Nup98-HoxA9-mediated activation of Hox genes. Collectively, our results indicate that highly selective targeting of Nup98-fusion proteins to Hox cluster regions via prebound Crm1 induces the formation of higher order chromatin structures that causes aberrant Hox gene regulation.  The nucleoporin Nup98 is a mobile component of the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) ( Griffis et al., 2002; Rabut et al., 2004; Oka et al., 2010 ), a sole gateway for selective nucleocytoplasmic macromolecular traffic. Nup98 is essential for such fundamental functions of NPC as selective nucleocytoplasmic transport ( Radu et al., 1995; Powers et al., 1997; Zolotukhin and Felber, 1999; Oka et al., 2010 ) and maintenance of the permeability barrier ( Hulsmann et al., 2012; Laurell et al., 2011 ). Besides, Nup98 is known as a multifunctional nucleoporin; it has been shown that Nup98 is involved in gene regulation ( Capelson et al., 2010; Kalverda et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2013; Light et al., 2013 ), posttranscriptional regulation of specific sets of messenger\u00a0RNAs ( mRNAs ) ( Singer et al., 2012 ), mitotic spindle assembly ( Cross and Powers, 2011 ), mitotic checkpoint ( Jeganathan et al., 2005; Salsi et al., 2014 ), and NPC disassembly ( Laurell et al., 2011 ). In leukemia, Nup98 is frequently found in the form of Nup98-fusions, which consist of N-terminal half of Nup98 containing multiple phenylalanine-glycine ( FG ) repeats and C-terminus of various partner proteins ( Gough et al., 2011 ). More than 30 different proteins with various physiological functions have been reported as Nup98 fusion partners ( reviewed in ( Gough et al., 2011 ) ). However, the molecular mechanism of Nup98-fusion mediated leukemogenesis is still largely unknown. Nup98-HoxA9 is one of the most frequent Nup98-fusion resulting from t ( 7;11 ) ( p15;p15 ) chromosomal translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myeloid leukemia ( Nakamura et al., 1996; Borrow et al., 1996; Nishiyama et al., 1999; Yamamoto et al., 2000 ). Indeed, the ectopic expression of Nup98-HoxA9 induces leukemia in mice ( Kroon et al., 2001; Iwasaki et al., 2005; Dash et al., 2002 ). It also has been shown that Nup98-HoxA9 inhibits hematopoietic cell differentiation ( Kroon et al., 2001; Calvo et al., 2002; Takeda et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2006; Yassin et al., 2009 ) and enhances symmetric division of hematopoietic precursor cells in vitro ( Wu et al., 2007 ), suggesting that Nup98-HoxA9 contributes to leukemogenesis most likely by impairing cellular differentiation. With regard to its molecular function, Nup98-HoxA9 was shown to act as a transcriptional regulator ( Kasper et al., 1999; Ghannam et al., 2004; Bei et al., 2005; Yassin et al., 2009 ). In addition, genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that ectopic expression of Nup98-HoxA9 causes upregulation, rather than downregulation, of numerous genes ( Ghannam et al., 2004; Takeda et al., 2006 ). Mechanistically, the FG repeat of Nup98 is known to associate with CREB-binding\u00a0protein ( CBP ) /p300 ( Kasper et al., 1999 ), a histone acetyltransferase that functions as a transcriptional co-activator, and histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) 1 ( Bai et al., 2006 ). However, the interaction of Nup98 FG repeats with p300 by itself is not sufficient to promote self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells ( Yung et al., 2011 ). Thus, the exact function of Nup98-HoxA9 still remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Nup98-HoxA9 is specifically recruited to the vicinity of Hox cluster genes via chromosomally bound Crm1, a nuclear export factor that was originally identified as a protein required for maintaining the chromosomal structure in yeast ( Adachi and Yanagida, 1989 ), to activate Hox cluster regions.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell ( which includes plant and animal cells ) contains most of the cell\u2019s genetic material in the form of carefully packaged strands of DNA. Genes are stretches of DNA that contain the instructions needed to produce the proteins and RNA molecules that the cell needs to survive. These molecules move across the membrane that surrounds the nucleus through pores made of proteins. One of these pore-forming proteins is called Nup98. The gene that produces Nup98 is frequently mutated in leukemia, where part of it becomes fused to regions of other unrelated genes. The proteins made from these combined genes are known as \u201cfusion proteins\u201d. The Nup98-HoxA9 fusion protein has been well studied, and appears to cause leukemia by interfering with the process called ( \u201ccell differentiation\u201d ) by which stem cells specialize to form different types of blood cells. During cell differentiation, cells change which sets of genes they activate to become specific types of cells. A family of genes called Hox genes ( to which the gene for HoxA9 belongs ) is critical in cell differentiation and thus must be fine-tuned. It is also known that the Hox genes form clusters, and its activation is partly controlled by how tightly the DNA is packaged. Previous studies have shown that the Nup98-HoxA9 fusion protein takes on the form of small dots in the nucleus. Oka et al. have now tracked how these proteins are distributed inside of the nucleus, and examined which part of the DNA they bind to, in more detail. This revealed that the dots of Nup98-HoxA9 tend to associate with tightly packed DNA, especially on Hox cluster genes, and activate these genes. Oka et al. further found that a protein called Crm1, which is well known as a nuclear export factor that carries molecules out of the nucleus through the pore, is already bound to the Hox cluster genes in the nucleus and recruits the Nup98-HoxA9 protein. This interaction may change how the Hox gene is packaged in the nucleus. A future challenge will be to reveal how the Nup98-HoxA9 fusion protein and Crm1 on Hox cluster genes control gene expression ."}

Little is known, however, of how nascent connections are organized to support such new behaviors alongside existing ones. To understand this, in the larval zebrafish we examined the development of spinal pathways from hindbrain V2a neurons and the role of these pathways in the development of locomotion. We found that new projections are continually layered laterally to existing neuropil, and give rise to distinct pathways that function in parallel to existing pathways. Across these chronologically layered pathways, the connectivity patterns and biophysical properties vary systematically to support a behavioral repertoire with a wide range of kinematics and dynamics. Such layering of new parallel circuits equipped with systematically changing properties may be central to the postnatal diversification and increasing sophistication of an animal\u2019s behavioral repertoire.  At the time of birth, most animals are only capable of a limited set of reflexive behaviors that ensure their immediate survival. However, as development progresses, their behavioral repertoire rapidly diversifies and they become capable of producing increasingly refined and cognitive behaviors ( Kagan and Herschkowitz, 2006; Harlow and Harlow, 1965; Fox, 1965; Drapeau et al., 2002 ). Concurrent with such changes, many new connections are rapidly being formed in the nervous system ( Gilmore et al., 2018 ) ; Semple et al. ( 2013 ) ; Levitt, 2003 ), suggesting that the formation of new connections is linked to the development of the behavioral repertoire. However, despite many studies that carried out circuit-level examination of the postnatal formation of new connections ( Morrie and Feller, 2016; Polley et al., 2013; Stein and Stanford, 2013; Kano and Watanabe, 2013 ) very little is known still of how nascent connections are organized to support a behavioral repertoire that grows by including increasingly more sophisticated behaviors while retaining vital reflexive behaviors. Recent studies in developing zebrafish have shed some light on the neural underpinnings of behavior development. As in most animals, the behavioral repertoire of zebrafish quickly diversifies after birth ( hatching ) to include more sophisticated behaviors ( Drapeau et al., 2002; McLean and Fetcho, 2009 ). At the time of birth, a zebrafish is mostly quiescent but in response to a tactile stimulus exhibits crude locomotor behaviors that entail powerful and large bends of the body such as seen during escape and struggle ( Figure 1A, Escape, Struggle ) ( McLean and Fetcho, 2009; Liao and Fetcho, 2008 ). This indicates that both of these early-born behaviors require strong activation of axial muscles across a large portion of the fish\u2019s body despite their differences with respect to the the direction of motion and tail beat frequency ( escape is forward locomotion with fast tail beat frequency while struggle is backward locomotion with slow tail beat frequency ). However, by 2 days after birth, the fish also spontaneously exhibit a more refined locomotor behavior wherein only the caudal portion of the tail moves ( Figure 1A, Spontaneous swim ) with relatively weaker and slower wave-like undulating movements ( McLean and Fetcho, 2009, Figure 1A; Mirat et al., 2013 ). Such movements are indicative of slow propagation of moderate axial muscle activity from the rostral to the caudal end of the moving part of the tail. With this type of tail-restricted locomotion, the fish is able to move forward by keeping its head, and therefore gaze, stable. This ability may be critical for the subsequent development of visually\u00a0guided behaviors such as prey capture. Escape, one of the crude locomotor patterns that emerge early after the birth of a zebrafish, is controlled by spinal interneurons that are born well before the animal\u2019s birth ( McLean and Fetcho, 2009; Kimura et al., 2006; Ekl\u00f6f-Ljunggren et al., 2012 ), whereas the more refined and weaker\u00a0locomotion pattern that emerges after an animal\u2019s birth is controlled by spinal interneurons that are born around the time of an animal\u2019s birth ( McLean et al., 2007; Satou et al., 2012; McLean and Fetcho, 2009 ). This indicates that the sequential emergence of new and more sophisticated locomotor patterns during development is mediated at the level of the spinal cord by the addition of distinct functional groups of neurons rather than by fine control of a single functional group ( Fetcho and McLean, 2010 ). Similarly in the mammalian spinal cord, it has been shown more recently that distinct functional groups emerge in sequence during development ( Tripodi et al., 2011 ). This finding has led to the idea that even in mammals, the development of the locomotor repertoire is supported by the addition of new functional groups ( Tripodi and Arber, 2012 ). However, it has yet to be revealed how the connections from the brain to emerging spinal functional groups are established so that new and existing spinal groups can be recruited appropriately by the brain to support the diversification of the locomotor repertoire. Locomotion-related signals from the brain reach the spinal cord by way of excitatory reticulospinal neurons of the hindbrain ( Dubuc et al., 2008; Grillner and Georgopoulos, 1996; Jordan et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2008 ). V2a neurons in the hindbrain, similar to the ones in the spinal cord, are glutamatergic and project their axons ipsilaterally ( Cepeda-Nieto et al., 2005; Kinkhabwala et al., 2011; Kimura et al., 2013; Bouvier et al., 2015 ). They include excitatory reticulospinal neurons ( Cepeda-Nieto et al., 2005; Kimura et al., 2013; Bouvier et al., 2015 ) and are capable of initiating and terminating locomotion ( Kimura et al., 2013; Bouvier et al., 2015 ). Interestingly, the hindbrain V2a neurons in larval zebrafish show a topographical organization that is related to differentiation time such that newly-born neurons stack dorsally to pre-existing ones ( Kinkhabwala et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, in a subset of the hindbrain V2a neurons, it has been shown that the ventral, and therefore early-born, population gets recruited during escape-like locomotion with fast tail beat frequency while the dorsal, and therefore late-born, population gets recruited during spontaneous swim-like locomotion with slow tail beat frequency ( Kinkhabwala et al., 2011 ). Even though it is unknown whether this finding holds true for the entire hindbrain V2a population, it suggests that, even in the hindbrain V2a neurons, distinct functional groups emerge in sequence and contribute to the development of locomotor behaviors. Such hindbrain organization raises the possibility that a new hindbrain functional group connects selectively to an age-matched spinal functional group to produce a novel locomotion pattern. However, it is also possible that hindbrain functional groups emerging in succession provide increasingly finer excitatory drive to all spinal groups, but each hindbrain group recruits only the age-matched spinal group because of the higher excitability of the latter compared to its predecessors ( McLean et al., 2007 ). Indeed, in the case of midbrain descending pathways, the recruitment of spinal neurons is determined not by selectivity of the descending inputs these neurons receive but by the biophysical properties they express ( Wang and McLean, 2014 ). Thus, it remains to be resolved how the the hindbrain descending neurons establish connections to the spinal functional groups during development to support the postnatal diversification and increased sophistication of locomotor patterns. Here, we examined the development of spinal pathways from the hindbrain V2a neurons and the role of these pathways in the development of locomotion. We show that early-born V2a descending neurons that project to the spinal cord early in development are only recruited during the stimulus-elicited crude and powerful locomotor patterns that appear early in development whereas their late-born counterparts that project to the spinal cord late in development are recruited during the more refined and weaker spontaneous locomotion that appears later in development. Moreover, the spinal projections of these two populations form spatially-distinct neuropil layers and give rise to parallel pathways instead of forming a series of non-selective pathways that differ in the strengths of their connections. Furthermore, these parallel pathways differ in their connectivity patterns and biophysical properties in a manner suitable for the locomotor behavior they participate in. The early-born group makes direct connections to a class of motoneurons capable of producing strong axial muscle activity across a large extent of the spinal cord. The early-born group also expresses biophysical properties with fast time constants. Both these features are well-suited for producing the crude types of locomotion that appear early in development in that they support the near simultaneous activation of axial muscles across a large extent of the fish\u2019s body. On the other hand, the late-born group connects to the late-born spinal interneurons that are active during refined locomotion and express biophysical properties with slow kinetics. These interneurons innervate to a class of motoneurons that produce weaker axial muscle activity in the caudal spinal cord. These features make the late-born group more suitable for producing the refined locomotion that appears later in development in that they support the moderate axial muscle activity in the caudal portion of the tail. Indeed, ablation of each group produced deficits in distinct motor patterns: ablation of the early-born group weakened the sensory-elicited crude and fast locomotion whereas ablation of the late-born group affected the more refined and slower spontaneous locomotion. Altogether, we reveal in the descending circuits a chronologically-layered parallel architecture underlying the diversification and increased sophistication of motor patterns in larval zebrafish. Even though chronotopic neuropil organization similar to what we have described here has been observed in many neural systems ( Espinosa and Luo, 2008;Tripodi et al., 2011; Voigt et al., 1993; Walsh and Guillery, 1985; Kulkarni et al., 2016; Brierley et al., 2009; Brierley et al., 2012 ), it has not been demonstrated in these systems how such organization relates to the postnatal development of behaviors. The findings we report here suggest that the chronological layering of parallel circuits and the systematic variation in the associated connectivity patterns and biophysical properties are fundamental attributes of the nervous system that form the basis for an animal\u2019s ability to exhibit new and increasingly sophisticated behaviors after birth while maintaining vital reflexive behaviors.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Newborn babies have limited abilities. Indeed, most of our actions shortly after birth are the result of reflexes that serve our most basic need: to stay alive. As we get older, however, our behaviour gradually becomes more sophisticated. During this time, the billions of cells in our brain form new connections to build intricate \u2018circuits\u2019 of neurons that allow for more complicated thoughts and actions. It is clear that the brain circuits that support new behaviours must develop in a way that does not interfere with the existing circuits that are vital for survival. However, the challenge has been to find a way to peer into a brain as it develops to see how these new circuits form. In recent years, zebrafish have revolutionised research into neuronal circuits in animals. Developing over the course of a few days, these small transparent fish provide a window into the brain during the earliest stages of development. Indeed, the circuits of neurons that descend from the brain and connect to the spinal cord have already been mapped in these animals. Now, Pujala and Koyama have begun to follow the careful development of these \u2018descending\u2019 neurons, and relate it to the appearance of new behaviours in young zebrafish. Time-lapse imaging with a fluorescent protein that is active only in specific descending neurons revealed that new circuits are laid down over existing ones, like the growth rings in a tree. Next, at different timepoints in zebrafish development, Pujala and Koyama traced these neurons backwards from the spine to the brain to identify which connections formed first. This showed that the spinal connections develop one after the other, in the same order that the neurons mature. Next, Pujala and Koyama asked how the activity of neurons that mature early or late in development relates to specific behaviours in young zebrafish. Early-born circuits connect to neurons that produce powerful, reflex-driven, whole-body movements such as an escape response. The later circuits connect to different neurons through slower, less direct pathways; the late-born neurons also generate the refined movements that are acquired later in a zebrafish\u2019s development and help the fish to explore its environment. These findings show that descending circuits in zebrafish run parallel to each other, but with distinct connections and properties that allow them to control different kinds of movements. While this study was conducted using an animal model, a better understanding of how such circuits develop and the movements they control may one day aid the treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases or injuries where connections have been lost ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nBrain connectivity maps display a delicate balance between individual variation and stereotypy, suggesting the existence of dedicated mechanisms that simultaneously permit and limit individual variation. We show that during the development of the Drosophila central nervous system, mutual inhibition among groups of neighboring postmitotic neurons during development regulates the robustness of axon target choice in a nondeterministic neuronal circuit. Specifically, neighboring postmitotic neurons communicate through Notch signaling during axonal targeting, to ensure balanced alternative axon target choices without a corresponding change in cell fate. Loss of Notch in postmitotic neurons modulates an axon's target choice. However, because neighboring axons respond by choosing the complementary target, the stereotyped connectivity pattern is preserved. In contrast, loss of Notch in clones of neighboring postmitotic neurons results in erroneous coinnervation by multiple axons. Our observations establish mutual inhibition of axonal target choice as a robustness mechanism for brain wiring and unveil a novel cell fate independent function for canonical Notch signaling.  Conceptually, coupling axonal target choice to neuronal cell fate determination has the advantage of generating highly reproducible wiring patterns. However, it has the evolutionary disadvantage of limiting individual variability, and thus efficient adaptation to environmental change. Furthermore, a strictly deterministic coupling has the significant developmental disadvantage of limiting cellular plasticity in response to inevitable genetic and epigenetic variability within the developing brain ( Muotri et al., 2005, 2010 ). The latter point is particularly critical in neuronal lineages that are intrinsically variable in cell number. Notch signaling is a highly conserved crucial regulator of early nervous system development. The most well-established function for Notch signaling in neural development is the selection of neural progenitor cells through a process termed mutual or lateral inhibition ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999 ). In lateral inhibition, a group of equivalent neuroepithelial cells that initially express roughly the same Notch activity are eventually segregated in two groups defined by expression and activity levels of the receptor Notch and its membrane-bound ligand Delta. Due to cell\u2013cell communication among overlapping clusters of adjacent cells, small differences in Notch expression level are amplified. As a consequence, the majority of cells within these clusters express high Notch activity levels, whereas a minority of cells express low Notch activity. These cells then go on to differentiate as neuronal progenitors. A second important function for Notch signaling is the establishment of alternate binary cell fates of sibling neurons. In contrast to lateral inhibition, this function requires the asymmetric inheritance of the Notch antagonist Numb by one of the two sibling neurons in a terminal cell division ( Guo et al., 1996; Spana and Doe, 1996; Knoblich, 1997 ). It has been proposed that early binary cell fate specification via Notch-Delta signaling results in alternative axon targeting. In the fly visual system, the R7 and R8 photoreceptors, which independently require Notch activity to be specified, make alternative axonal target choices that appear to be consequences of their different fates. Indeed, their canonical fate marker transcription factors Prospero and Senseless, respectively, are required for this differential targeting ( Morey et al., 2008 ). In the olfactory system of Drosophila, sibling neurons target their axon to different central nervous system ( CNS ) glomeruli due to differential cell fate specification ( Endo et al., 2007 ). A recent elegant extension of this work shows that chromatin modification of Notch targets by the Hamlet protein further diversifies cell fate and axonal targeting in olfactory neurons ( Endo et al., 2012 ). Interestingly, in this work, the effects were not restricted to sibling neurons, but extended to neighboring non-sibling neurons, and the corresponding effects on axonal targeting were not strictly binary nor fully penetrant leading to speculation that Notch activity might have probabilistic effects on axonal targeting downstream of cell fate specification ( Schmucker and Hassan, 2012 ). Finally, an extensive analysis of CNS neurons in the fly olfactory circuit shows that there are more diverse wiring morphologies than can be accounted for by the number of cell types ( Chou et al., 2010 ), suggesting that post-fate mechanisms may be crucial in wiring the Drosophila CNS. What these post-fate mechanisms are, and how they buffer intrinsic variability to generate stereotyped wiring patterns, is unknown. Here we show that the dorsal cluster neurons ( DCNs ), a group of bilateral commissural higher order neurons in the visual system of Drosophila ( Hassan et al., 2000 ) are intrinsically variable in number within and between individuals, yet generate a highly stereotyped wiring diagram. We combine high resolution quantitative anatomical analyses, computational modeling, and genetic dissection to show that Notch-mediated mutual inhibition acts late in development on postmitotic neurons to bias axonal target choice. Finally, we show that this mechanism ensures the reproducibility of the DCN connectivity pattern.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The brains of all members of a species are similar, but not identical, and these differences are partly responsible for the range of behaviors displayed by individuals. The development of the nervous system is known to depend on the Notch signaling pathway, but the mechanisms that regulate the balance between fixed patterns of neuronal connectivity vs individual variability are largely unknown. Notch proteins are transmembrane proteins, which means that they have one part inside the cell membrane and another outside the cell. When a ligand protein\u2014such as a Delta ligand\u2014binds to the part that is outside the cell, the Notch protein breaks in two and the part inside the cell travels to the nucleus, where it can influence the expression of genes. Cells are selected to become neurons through a process known as mutual, or lateral, inhibition. When a Delta ligand belonging to one cell binds to the Notch receptor on a neighboring cell, the production of Delta ligands in the second cell is reduced. This amplifies any initial differences in the amount of Delta produced by each cell, and leads ultimately to them becoming distinct cell types. Now, Langen et al. show that this same mechanism is reactivated at a later stage of development during wiring up of the visual system. They used the fruit fly ( Drosophila ) \u2014a model organism with a fully sequenced genome and short intergeneration time\u2014to study a group of brain cells known as dorsal cluster neurons. At the end of the fruit fly larval stage, these neurons extend long axons across the brain to the opposite hemisphere: however, it is unclear how the neurons decide which cells to form connections with. Using genetically modified flies, Langen et al. showed that inhibiting Notch in a single dorsal cluster neuron caused that neuron to target a different cell: however, other neurons adjusted their choices accordingly so that the overall pattern of connections remained unchanged. Inhibiting Notch in a cluster of dorsal cluster neurons, on the other hand, disrupted the entire network, suggesting that Notch-mediated communication between neurons ( via mutual inhibition ) is needed to establish a robust wiring map. Langen et al. suggest that evolution has favored a mechanism that ensures that the overall pattern of connections within a circuit is preserved, while individual connections differ from one species member to the next ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nDiverse clustered protocadherins are thought to function in neurite morphogenesis and neuronal connectivity in the brain. Here, we report that the protocadherin alpha ( Pcdha ) gene cluster regulates neuronal migration during cortical development and cytoskeletal dynamics in primary cortical culture through the WAVE ( Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin homologous protein, also known as Wasf ) complex. In addition, overexpression of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 ( Pyk2, also known as Ptk2b, Cak\u03b2, Raftk, Fak2, and Cadtk ), a non-receptor cell-adhesion kinase and scaffold protein downstream of Pcdh\u03b1, impairs cortical neuron migration via inactivation of the small GTPase Rac1. Thus, we define a molecular Pcdh\u03b1/WAVE/Pyk2/Rac1 axis from protocadherin cell-surface receptors to actin cytoskeletal dynamics in cortical neuron migration and dendrite morphogenesis in mouse brain.  The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, and each neuron engages in several thousand specific synaptic connections, resulting in complex neural networks with over 1015 specific connections. These complex neural circuits are required for normal brain function, and inappropriate assemblies of neural circuits underlie neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders ( Hyman, 2008 ). A remarkable feature of neurodevelopment is the long-distance neuronal migration from the site of origin to the final destination ( Angevine and Sidman, 1961; Ayala et al., 2007 ). For example, cortical immature neurons generated from the proliferative ventricular and subventricular zones ( VZ/SVZ ) migrate radially through specific phases to appropriate laminar positions in an \u2018inside-out\u2019 manner and then differentiate into distinct subtypes of cortical neurons ( Angevine and Sidman, 1961; LoTurco and Bai, 2006; Rakic, 1974 ). The cortical migration phases include somal translocation, multipolar migration, and glial-guided locomotion ( Ayala et al., 2007; Cooper, 2014; Noctor et al., 2004 ). Newly\u00a0born bipolar neurons in SVZ assume multipolar or stellate morphology and migrate randomly in the intermediate zone ( IZ ), moving tangentially, up, or down ( Ayala et al., 2007; Cooper, 2014; Jossin and Cooper, 2011; Nadarajah et al., 2003; Noctor et al., 2004; Tabata and Nakajima, 2003 ). They then transit into bipolar again near the border of IZ/CP ( cortical plate ) and resume final radial migration to settle in appropriate cortical layers ( Ayala et al., 2007; Cooper, 2014; Jossin and Cooper, 2011; Nadarajah et al., 2003; Noctor et al., 2004; Tabata and Nakajima, 2003 ). Abnormal neuronal migration results in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases ( Ayala et al., 2007; LoTurco and Bai, 2006; Valiente and Mar\u00edn, 2010 ) ; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms for the abnormal neuronal migration is largely unknown. Human genetics studies have implicated mutations of the clustered protocadherin ( Pcdh ) cell adhesion genes in the 5q31 region for various developmental and psychiatric disorders ( Anitha et al., 2013; Iossifov et al., 2012; Pedrosa et al., 2008; Shimojima et al., 2011 ). Similar to Dscam1 in Drosophila ( Zipursky and Sanes, 2010 ), diverse clustered Pcdh genes play an important role in establishing neuronal identity and connectivity in the vertebrate brain ( Garrett et al., 2012; Lefebvre et al., 2012; Molumby et al., 2016; Nicoludis et al., 2016; Rubinstein et al., 2015; Schreiner and Weiner, 2010; Suo et al., 2012; Thu et al., 2014; Wu and Maniatis, 1999 ). In mice, 58 clustered Pcdh genes are organized into three closely\u00a0linked Pcdh \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 clusters ( Pcdha, Pcdhb, and Pcdhg ) ( Wu et al., 2001 ). The Pcdh \u03b1 and \u03b3 clusters are each consisted of variable and constant regions, similar to that of the Ig, Tcr, and Ugt1 gene clusters ( Wu, 2005; Wu and Maniatis, 1999; Wu et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2004 ). In particular, the variable region of the mouse Pcdh\u03b1 cluster contains 12 highly\u00a0similar \u2018alternate exons\u2019, \u03b11-\u03b112, whose promoters are stochastically activated by distal enhancers, and two divergent c-type \u2018ubiquitous exons\u2019, \u03b1c1 and \u03b1c2, whose promoters are constitutively activated by distal enhancers ( Figure 1A ) ( Guo et al., 2012 ). Each variable exon is separately spliced to the common set of downstream constant exons, generating diverse mRNAs and proteins. CCCTC-binding factor ( CTCF ) /Cohesin-mediated topological chromatin-looping domains are crucial for proper expression of Pcdh\u03b1 proteins ( Guo et al., 2015; Huang and Wu, 2016 ). Each variable exon encodes an extracellular domain ( ectodomain EC1-6 ), a transmembrane segment, and a juxtamembrane variable cytoplasmic domain ( VCD ) ( Shonubi et al., 2015; Wu and Maniatis, 1999 ), whereas the three constant exons encode a common membrane-distal constant domain ( CD ) of all Pcdh\u03b1 proteins ( Figure 1A ). This suggests that diverse extracellular cues converge on a single intracellular signaling pathway. However, the functional significance of this intriguing arrangement remains obscure. A large family of cell-surface receptors, including Pcdh\u03b16 ( Pcdha6 ), recruit WAVE complex to the plasma membrane ( Chen et al., 2014; Nakao et al., 2008; Tai et al., 2010 ). The WAVE complex is a conserved two-partite pentameric complex consisting of a pseudosymmetric dimer of Sra1/Cyfip1 and Nap1/Hem2, and a heteromeric trimer of HSPC300/Brick, Abi1/2/3, and WAVE1/2/3/SCAR ( Chen et al., 2010 ). First, Abi2 interacts with Abelson tyrosine kinase ( Abl kinase ) and has been implicated in cortical radial migration ( Xie et al., 2013 ). Second, WAVEs/SCARs are members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and WASP verprolin homologous protein family, defined by a conserved VCA domain ( verprolin homologous, cofilin homologous or central hydrophobic, and acidic regions ) ( Chen et al., 2010 ). Third, VCA is inhibited by intermolecular interaction with Sra1 and intramolecular interaction within WAVE ( Chen et al., 2010; Padrick et al., 2011; Rohatgi et al., 1999 ). Fourth, Rac1 binds to WAVE complex and induces a conformational change to release VCA from its inhibitory state and to activate actin filament nucleation and branching through the Arp2/3 complex ( Chen et al., 2010; Lebensohn and Kirschner, 2009; Padrick et al., 2011; Rohatgi et al., 1999; Ti et al., 2011 ). Finally, Pyk2, a calcium-dependent cell-adhesion kinase and scaffold protein highly expressed in the brain and inhibited by Pcdh\u03b1, also regulates neurodevelopment ( Chen et al., 2009; Hsin et al., 2010; Lev et al., 1995; Suo et al., 2012 ). However, whether and how WAVE complex and Pyk2 kinase function in cortical neuron migration are not clear. Here, we report that Pcdh\u03b1 proteins play a critical role in neuronal migration and cytoskeletal dynamics. Specifically, we define an actin cytoskeleton remodeling pathway by which Pcdh\u03b1 regulates lamellipodial and filopodial dynamics and neuronal migration as well as dendrite morphogenesis through interaction with WAVE complex via the WIRS ( WAVE interacting receptor sequence ) motif of Pcdh\u03b1 constant domain ( CD ). In addition, Pyk2 regulates cortical neuron migration by inactivating the small GTPase Rac1. Given that actin cytoskeletal dynamics are central for neurite morphogenesis and neuronal migration, our findings have interesting implications for mechanisms of Pcdh\u03b1 functions in dendrite self-avoidance and\u00a0neuronal self/nonself recognition in normal brain development as well as aberrant neuron migration and dendrite\u00a0morphogenesis underlying complex neurodevelopmental diseases.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: There are hundreds of billions of neurons in a human brain, and each one can form several thousand connections with other neurons. This complex network determines our thoughts, memories, personality, and behavior, but how does it form ? During brain development, specific areas give rise to new neurons, which then migrate long distances to other parts of the brain. Upon arrival, they generate several structures, called dendrites, which connect with other neurons. To distribute themselves correctly, the migrating immature neurons must be able to travel long distances and steer clear of one another. The dendrites from a single mature neuron must also avoid each other, a phenomenon known as self-avoidance. Certain membrane-spanning proteins, called clustered protocadherins, may help neurons achieve this. The portion of the protocadherins that sits on the cell surface is highly variable, and acts as a zipcode that helps cells to recognize one another. However, the section of the protein inside the cell varies little and is shared by all members of a protocadherin family. When the clustered protocadherin is \u2018switched on\u2019, this internal segment can trigger a cascade of reactions that create changes in the cell. Yet, little was known about the nature of this signaling cascade. Using gene editing in mice, Fan, Lu et al. focus on the signaling cascade of the clustered protocadherin alpha family. The experiments show that the internal portion of these proteins interacts with a protein complex called WAVE. It also inhibits an enzyme known as Pyk2, which increases the activity of another enzyme called Rac1 GTPase, that then further activates WAVE. This results in the WAVE complex also interacting with the internal skeleton inside the neurons and dendrites, which regulates the ability of these cells to migrate and of the dendrites to avoid each other. Many brain conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or depression, result from abnormal neuronal migration and connectivity. Mutations in the genes of clustered protocadherins increase the risk of these disorders. By showing how these proteins help to regulate the migration and connectivity of neurons, Fan, Lu et al. add to our understanding of brain development in health and disease ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nSelf-assembly of ESCRT-III complex is a critical step in all ESCRT-dependent events. ESCRT-III hetero-polymers adopt variable architectures, but the mechanisms of inter-subunit recognition in these hetero-polymers to create flexible architectures remain unclear. We demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ESCRT-III subunit Snf7 uses a conserved acidic helix to recruit its partner Vps24. Charge-inversion mutations in this helix inhibit Snf7-Vps24 lateral interactions in the polymer, while rebalancing the charges rescues the functional defects. These data suggest that Snf7-Vps24 assembly occurs through electrostatic interactions on one surface, rather than through residue-to-residue specificity. We propose a model in which these cooperative electrostatic interactions in the polymer propagate to allow for specific inter-subunit recognition, while sliding of laterally interacting polymers enable changes in architecture at distinct stages of vesicle biogenesis. Our data suggest a mechanism by which interaction specificity and polymer flexibility can be coupled in membrane-remodeling heteropolymeric assemblies.  Eukaryotic organelles that are demarcated by membranes undergo continuous remodeling to maintain their integrity and function. Different evolutionarily conserved heteropolymeric machines and scaffolds including ESCRTs ( endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ), dynamin, clathrin, COP coatmers, BAR-domain containing proteins, etc. control the remodeling at different organelles ( Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006 ). This polymerization-mediated membrane remodeling in eukaryotes is important for various cellular events such as trafficking, cell-division and migration. In bacteria, structural homologs of actin and tubulin ( that include FtsZ and MreB proteins ) also form heteropolymers, which deform and remodel membranes, leading to cell shape maintenance and division ( Eun et al., 2015 ). In most cases these proteins are recruited to the membrane from the cytosol as monomers, polymerization then occurs on the 2D membrane, which generates the mechanical force to bend membranes. Given the functional importance of polymerization, elucidating mechanisms of how these various machines recognize their partners to form heteropolymers, and how these polymers adapt to physical and mechanical changes in the cellular environment is critical to our overall understanding of how cells control membrane homeostasis. ESCRTs drive an ever-growing list of cellular processes. These include biogenesis of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) ( Katzmann et al., 2001; Odorizzi et al., 1998 ), viral budding ( Garrus et al., 2001 ), cytokinesis ( Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007 ), nuclear envelope reformation ( Olmos et al., 2015; Vietri et al., 2015 ), plasma membrane repair ( Jimenez et al., 2014 ), surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes ( Webster et al., 2014 ), lysosomal protein degradation ( Zhu et al., 2017 ), endolysosomal repair ( Skowyra et al., 2018 ), and so on Hurley ( 2015 ). This machinery consists of five evolutionarily conserved complexes, ESCRT-0, I, II, III and the AAA ATPase Vps4. ESCRT-0, I and II are recruited to the membrane through interactions with ubiquitinated proteins, while ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-II also bind phosphatidyl-inositol-3-phosphate ( PI3P ) at membranes ( Robinson et al., 1988; Rothman et al., 1989; Raymond et al., 1992; Katzmann et al., 2001; Babst et al., 1997; Katzmann et al., 2003; Babst et al., 2002a; Babst et al., 2002b ). ESCRT-II recruits ESCRT-III, also nucleating ESCRT-III polymerization. Polymerization of ESCRT-III is dynamically rearranged and directed towards disassembly via the recruitment of the AAA ATPase Vps4 ( Mierzwa et al., 2017; Adell et al., 2017 ). The requirement of early ESCRTs ( 0, I and II ) varies between the different membranes. For example, in viral budding processes, the ESCRT-0 complex is not required, while in cytokinetic abscission neither ESCRT-0 nor ESCRT-II are required. ESCRT-III, however, is ubiquitously required in all ESCRT-dependent processes. This membrane-modifying property of ESCRT-III is assumed to be a direct consequence of its self-assembly into meso-scale polymers. The requirement of ESCRT-III function in all ESCRT-dependent processes emphasizes the importance of understanding the molecular details of ESCRT-III co-assembly. ESCRT-III proteins are\u00a0~26 KDa charged proteins that assemble into a polymer at membranes. In yeast, the \u2018core\u2019 ESCRT-III machinery consists of Vps20, Snf7, Vps24 and Vps2, as the deletion of any of these four genes leads to a strong defect in the MVB pathway ( Babst et al., 2002b ). Other ESCRT-III proteins consist of Ist1, Did2, Vps60 and Chm7, which have accessory roles in the MVB pathway, but are essential in mammalian cytokinesis ( Ist1/Did2 ) ( Bajorek et al., 2009a ) or nuclear envelope sealing ( Chm7 ) ( Webster et al., 2016 ). All ESCRT-III proteins consist of an N-terminal helical bundle, which is predominantly basic, and a C-terminal flexible and acidic region ( Muzio\u0142 et al., 2006; Bajorek et al., 2009b ). The N-terminal helical bundle is known to be important for ESCRT-III co-assembly ( Henne et al., 2012 ), while the C-terminus recruits the AAA ATPase Vps4 ( Obita et al., 2007 ). Different architectures of ESCRT-III polymers have been visualized with electron microscopy \u2013 flat sheets, rings, spirals and helices, owing to the flexible nature of the polymers ( Henne et al., 2012; Hanson et al., 2008; Chiaruttini et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2014 ). The most abundant of the ESCRT-III proteins, Snf7, forms 2D spirals. Combination of Snf7 with downstream proteins Vps24 and Vps2 changes the architecture of these spirals to form three dimensional helical polymers ( Henne et al., 2012 ). The mammalian orthologues of Vps24 and Vps2 ( named CHMP3 and CHMP2 ) co-assemble to form helical structures ( Lata et al., 2008 ), whereas Vps24 has been visualized to form linear polymers ( Ghazi-Tabatabai et al., 2008 ). Despite our understanding of the individual homo-polymerization mechanism ( Snf7-Snf7 ), the mechanisms of how ESCRT-III proteins recognize one another to create heteropolymers remain unclear. While recruitment of downstream ESCRT-III proteins Vps24 and Vps2 by Snf7 is established, what roles these partners of Snf7 play in regulating the polymers of Snf7 remain unclear. How these proteins change the architecture of the flat 2D spirals of Snf7 to 3D helical structures also remains undefined. Furthermore, in analyzing ESCRT-III polymerization, most studies only focus on either biochemical/structural approaches, or only cell biological approaches, with a limited number of studies combining both approaches to understand ESCRT-III function in vivo. Here, we apply a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to shed light on the hetero-polymerization mechanisms of ESCRT-III proteins Snf7 and Vps24. In particular, we utilize powerful directed evolution-based approaches in yeast to select for Snf7 mutants that rescue polymerization defects. These approaches allow us to describe in vivo mechanisms that ESCRT-III utilizes to co-assemble in the MVB pathway and provide guidance to understand existing literature on ESCRT-III filament structures. We previously reported the crystal structure of Snf7 ( Tang et al., 2015 ), which depicted the ESCRT-III subunit in an \u2018active, \u2019 polymerization-capable conformation. This structure provided important clues regarding how the polymerization of Snf7 is regulated. Here, we identify and characterize a motif in Snf7 critical for recruitment of its downstream partner Vps24. Mutagenesis analyses suggest that this motif is involved in Snf7/ESCRT-III lateral interaction in vitro. The acidic nature on its solvent-exposed surface, rather than a consensus sequence, is important for the function of this helix, suggesting an electrostatic mechanism that Snf7, and most likely all ESCRT-III subunits, use to recognize their partners. We hypothesize that ESCRT-III proteins utilize these lateral charge interactions with weak residue-to-residue specificity to slide on the filaments, enabling them to form spiraling polymers of different diameters and architectures.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells are separated from the outside environment by a fatty layer called the plasma membrane. This layer not only isolates the inside of the cell from the outside, it is also essential for the cell to sense and respond to cues around it. For example, the plasma membrane contains different types of proteins that can act as receptors for signals from outside the cell or as channels to take in essential nutrients. One of the ways that the cell can respond to its environment is by recycling the proteins at the plasma membrane. During a cell\u2019s life, proteins from its membrane are recycled by being pulled into lysosomes, which are sacs or vesicles full of enzymes that digest these molecules. However, before reaching the lysosomes, the molecules pass through another set of vesicles called endosomes. There, ESCRT-III, a flexible scaffold made out of the proteins Snf7, Vps24 and Vps2, forms a spiral like-structure that collects the proteins and fats from the membrane. This corkscrew-like shape allows the ESCRT-III scaffold to work, but it is unclear how it is formed. Snf7 is a protein that forms long bending chains, or \u201cpolymers\u201d, by linking to itself. Banjade et al. found that Snf7 uses its negatively charged surface to interact with the parallel chain that Vps24 and Vps2 form at its side. However, Vps24 and Vps2 do not fit rigidly into Snf7 like a key fits in a lock. Rather, their interaction is flexible, based on charge. This flexibility may allow Vps24 and Vps2 to slide along the side of the Snf7 chain, helping to create a spiral. Banjade et al. used budding yeast as a model organism and also imaged purified proteins with electron microscopy to come upon these findings. Understanding how ESCRT proteins interact to form complex structures may lead to a better understanding of how other membrane-bound polymers form elsewhere in the cell. ESCRT proteins are also involved in degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, where proteins that need to be recycled cannot be properly processed, and they are important for viruses such as HIV to spread between cells. Understanding how these proteins interact to form their characteristic spiral structure could potentially lead to the development of new therapies ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nPlastids are supported by a wide range of proteins encoded within the nucleus and imported from the cytoplasm. These plastid-targeted proteins may originate from the endosymbiont, the host, or other sources entirely. Here, we identify and characterise 770 plastid-targeted proteins that are conserved across the ochrophytes, a major group of algae including diatoms, pelagophytes and kelps, that possess plastids derived from red algae. We show that the ancestral ochrophyte plastid proteome was an evolutionary chimera, with 25% of its phylogenetically tractable nucleus-encoded proteins deriving from green algae. We additionally show that functional mixing of host and plastid proteomes, such as through dual-targeting, is an ancestral feature of plastid evolution. Finally, we detect a clear phylogenetic signal from one ochrophyte subgroup, the lineage containing pelagophytes and dictyochophytes, in plastid-targeted proteins from another major algal lineage, the haptophytes. This may represent a possible serial endosymbiosis event deep in eukaryotic evolutionary history.  Since their origin, the eukaryotes have diversified into an extraordinary array of organisms, with different genome contents, physiological properties, and ecological adaptations ( Dorrell and Smith, 2011; de Vargas et al., 2015; Dorrell and Howe, 2012a ). Perhaps the most profound change that has occurred within individual eukaryotic cells is the acquisition of plastids via endosymbiosis, which has happened at least eleven times across the tree of life ( Dorrell and Smith, 2011 ). All but one characterized group of photosynthetic eukaryotes possess plastids resulting from a single ancient endosymbiosis of a beta-cyanobacterium by an ancestor of the archaeplastid lineage ( consisting of green algae and plants, red algae, and glaucophytes ) ( Dorrell and Smith, 2011 ). Photosynthesis has subsequently spread outside of the archaeplastids through secondary, tertiary, or more complex endosymbiosis events. By far the most ecologically successful of these lineages are those that possess plastids derived from secondary or more complex endosymbioses of a red alga ( Dorrell and Smith, 2011; Baurain et al., 2010; Stiller et al., 2014 ). These are the \u2018CASH lineages\u2019, consisting of photosynthetic members of the cryptomonads, alveolates ( such as dinoflagellates ), stramenopiles ( also referred to as heterokonts ) and haptophytes ( Dorrell and Smith, 2011; Baurain et al., 2010 ) ( see Table 1 and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 for definitions ). The most prominent of these are the photosynthetic members of the stramenopiles, termed the ochrophytes ( de Vargas et al., 2015; Aleoshin et al., 2016; \u0160ev\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 2015 ). The ochrophytes include the diatoms, which are major primary producers in the ocean ( Bowler et al., 2010; Armbrust et al., 2004 ), multicellular kelps, which serve as spawning grounds for marine animals ( Cock et al., 2010 ) and the pelagophytes, microscopic algae of which some are known\u00a0to\u00a0form harmful blooms ( Gobler et al., 2011 ) ( Figure 1, panel A; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ). The stramenopiles also contain many aplastidic and non-photosynthetic lineages ( e. g., oomycetes ), which diverge at the base of the ochrophytes and play important roles as pathogens and in microbial food webs ( Aleoshin et al., 2016; Derelle et al., 2016 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 23717. 003Figure 1.

The blue bars show the number of positive controls identified to pass a specific conservation threshold, plotted against the left hand vertical axis of the graph, while the red bars show the number of negative controls that pass the same conservation threshold, plotted against the right hand vertical axis of the graph. The number of different sub-categories included in each conservation threshold is shown in a heatmap below the two graphs, with the specific distribution for each bar in the graph shown in the aligned cells directly beneath it. Each shaded cell corresponds to an identified orthologue in one sub-category of a particular ochrophyte lineage: orange cells indicate presence of chrysistan sub-categories; light brown cells the presence of hypogyristean sub-categories; and dark brown cells the presence of diatom sub-categories. In each graph, black arrows label the conservation thresholds inferred to give the strongest separation ( as inferred by chi-squared P-value ) between positive and negative control sequences.

Ochrophytes possess plastids of ultimate red origin, and form the most significant component of eukaryotic marine phytoplankton ( Dorrell and Smith, 2011; de Vargas et al., 2015 ). HaptophytesSingle-celled, photosynthetic eukaryotes, possessing complex plastids of ultimate red origin. Some haptophytes ( the coccolithophorids ) are renowned for their ability to form large blooms ( visible from space ), and to form intricate calcareous shells ( Dorrell and Smith, 2011; Bown, 1998 ), which if deposited on the ocean floor go on to form a major component of limestone and other sedimentary rocks. HPPG\u2018Homologous plastid protein group\u2019. Proteins identified in this study to possess plastid-targeting sequences that are homologous to one another, as defined by BLAST-based HPPG assembly and single gene phylogenetic analysis. Following their acquisition, plastids have undergone a number of evolutionary changes that bound them more intricately with the biology of the host. These include the transfer of plastid-derived genes to the host nucleus ( Dorrell and Howe, 2012a; Ruck et al., 2014; Stegemann et al., 2003 ) and the targeting of proteins encoded within the nucleus to the plastid ( Nowack and Grossman, 2012; Kleffmann et al., 2004 ). Previous studies have shown that many plastid-targeted proteins are not derived from the genomes of the corresponding endosymbiont lineage ( Curtis et al., 2012 ). Proteins encoded by genes acquired from other sources, such as laterally acquired genes ( Qiu et al., 2013; Morse et al., 1995 ) or previous endosymbiotic organelles historically possessed by the host ( Dorrell and Howe, 2015, 2012b ), or proteins that have been repurposed from endogenous host organelles ( Fast et al., 2001; Harper and Keeling, 2003 ) have important roles in supporting the biology of plastid lineages. Other gene transfer events, e. g. from food sources ( Nowack et al., 2016 ), bacterial symbionts ( Dunning Hotopp et al., 2007 ), viruses ( Gornik et al., 2012 ), or diazotrophic non-plastid cyanobacterial endosymbionts ( Prechtl et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2012 ) might\u00a0have also played major roles in the evolution of the diverse range of plastid proteins observed today. It nonetheless remains largely unknown which proteins had the most fundamental roles in establishing current plastid lineages ( Dorrell and Howe, 2012a ), i. e., which plastid proteins represent the ancestral components of plastid-targeted proteomes. Ochrophytes represent an excellent system in which to reconstruct the origins of plastid proteomes. Firstly, plastid-targeting sequences in different ochrophytes are relatively well conserved, enabling in silico prediction of plastid-targeted proteins from a wide range of different species ( Gruber et al., 2015; Gschloessl et al., 2008 ), in contrast to plastid-targeting sequences within archaeplastid lineages, which are extremely variable ( Fuss et al., 2013; Suzuki and Miyagishima, 2010 ). Secondly, compared to other CASH lineages ( haptophytes, cryptomonads, and dinoflagellates ), ochrophytes represent an extremely well characterised system for experimental and bioinformatic investigation, with ( to date ) eleven complete genomes, and transcriptome libraries available for over 150 species through MMETSP ( the Marine Microeukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project ) and through other sources ( Mock et al., 2017; Keeling et al., 2014 ). Reliable transformation and other manipulation strategies are also available for multiple species, such as the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum ( Siaut et al., 2007; Takahashi et al., 2007; Radakovits et al., 2013 ). Thirdly, the origin of the ochrophyte plastid is an evolutionarily valuable topic to understand. It is currently not known when the ochrophyte plastid was acquired: whether it originated recently, predates the radiation of aplastidic stramenopile relatives ( Stiller et al., 2014; Aleoshin et al., 2016; Derelle et al., 2016 ), or was acquired prior to the divergence of stramenopiles from their closest relatives, the alveolates ( Janouskovec et al., 2010 ). Verifying a late origin for the ochrophyte plastid would thus enable insights into the cellular changes that accompany the transition from a solely heterotrophic to a phototrophic lifestyle ( Aleoshin et al., 2016; Derelle et al., 2016 ), which is currently not possible for archaeplastids ( Burki et al., 2016; Cavalier-Smith et al., 2015 ), and difficult for haptophytes and cryptomonads, in which these relatives respectively remain unknown or understudied at a genomic level ( Burki et al., 2016; Yabuki et al., 2014 ). It has additionally been proposed, based on the presence of large numbers of genes of putative green algal origin in diatom genomes ( Frommolt et al., 2008; Petersen et al., 2006 ), that the ancestor of ochrophytes once possessed a green algal endosymbiont, which was subsequently replaced via the serial endosymbiosis of a red algal-derived plastid ( Dorrell and Smith, 2011; Moustafa et al., 2009 ). This hypothesis remains controversial ( Ku et al., 2015; Woehle et al., 2011; Deschamps and Moreira, 2012 ), in particular due to issues associated with the distinction of genes of red and green algal origins in ochrophyte genomes ( Matsuzaki et al., 2004; Coll\u00e9n et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2015 ). A final evolutionary suggestion regarding ochrophytes is that they have acted as endosymbiotic donors into other CASH lineages. One recent study proposed that haptophytes possess plastids acquired via the endosymbiosis of an ochrophyte ( Stiller et al., 2014 ), although the exact identity of this endosymbiotic acquisition remain unresolved. Characterising the ancestral ochrophyte plastid proteome might therefore help answer major questions about the ways in which plastids become established in the host cell, and provide valuable insights into the origins and diversification of other ecologically important algal lineages. In this study, we present an experimentally verified in silico reconstruction of the proteins targeted to the plastid of the last common ochrophyte ancestor. We show that this ancestral plastid-targeted proteome was an evolutionary mosaic, containing 770 proteins from a range of different sources. Our dataset indicates that the ochrophyte plastid was acquired late in stramenopile evolution, following the divergence of extant aplastidic relatives, that plastid-targeted proteins of green algal origin played a significant role in its origin, and that there has been bidirectional integration of the biology of the ochrophyte host and plastid proteomes, such as the ancient recruitment of proteins from both host and endosymbiont to dually support the biology of the plastid and mitochondria. Finally, we show evidence for an ancient endosymbiosis of a specific ochrophyte lineage, an ancestor of the pelagophytes and dictyochophytes, by a common ancestor of the haptophytes, which we propose- based on discrepancies between the origins of the haptophyte plastid proteome and genome- reveals a possible serial endosymbiosis event early in haptophyte evolution, preceding the origins of the current haptophyte plastid. Our work resolves several long-standing questions of ochrophyte evolution, and provides new insights into the origins and diversification of CASH lineages as a whole.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The cells of most plants and algae contain compartments called chloroplasts that enable them to capture energy from sunlight in a process known as photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are the remnants of photosynthetic bacteria that used to live freely in the environment until they were consumed by a larger cell. \u201cComplex\u201d chloroplasts can form if a cell that already has a chloroplast is swallowed by another cell. The most abundant algae in the oceans are known as diatoms. These algae belong to a group called the stramenopiles, which also includes giant seaweeds such as kelp. The stramenopiles have a complex chloroplast that they acquired from a red alga ( a relative of the seaweed used in sushi ). However, some of the proteins in their chloroplasts are from other sources, such as the green algal relatives of plants, and it was not clear how these chloroplast proteins have contributed to the evolution of this group. Many of the proteins that chloroplasts need to work properly are produced by the host cell and are then transported into the chloroplasts. Dorrell et al. studied the genetic material of many stramenopile species and identified 770 chloroplast-targeted proteins that are predicted to underpin the origins of this group. Experiments in a diatom called Phaeodactylum confirmed these predictions and show that many of these chloroplast-targeted proteins have been recruited from green algae, bacteria, and other compartments within the host cell to support the chloroplast. Further experiments suggest that another major group of algae called the haptophytes once had a stramenopile chloroplast. The current haptophyte chloroplast does not come from the stramenopiles so the haptophytes appear to have replaced their chloroplasts at least once in their evolutionary history. The findings show that algal chloroplasts are mosaics, supported by proteins from many different species. This helps us understand why certain species succeed in the wild and how they may respond to environmental changes in the oceans. In the future, these findings may help researchers to engineer new species of algae and plants for food and fuel production ."}

Here we report structures of complexes formed by the DD of p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75NTR ) with RhoGDI, for activation of the RhoA pathway, with caspase recruitment domain ( CARD ) of RIP2 kinase, for activation of the NF-kB pathway, and with itself, revealing how DD dimerization controls access of intracellular effectors to the receptor. RIP2 CARD and RhoGDI bind to p75NTR DD at partially overlapping epitopes with over 100-fold difference in affinity, revealing the mechanism by which RIP2 recruitment displaces RhoGDI upon ligand binding. The p75NTR DD forms non-covalent, low-affinity symmetric dimers in solution. The dimer interface overlaps with RIP2 CARD but not RhoGDI binding sites, supporting a model of receptor activation triggered by separation of DDs. These structures reveal how competitive protein-protein interactions orchestrate the hierarchical activation of downstream pathways in non-catalytic receptors.  The death domain ( DD ) is a globular protein module of 80\u201390 amino acid residues with a characteristic six-helix bundle fold ( Feinstein et al., 1995; Ferrao and Wu, 2012 ). DDs are present in a variety of proteins, including several members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ( TNFRSF ) and a range of intracellular signaling components, such as caspases and kinases. The DD family includes four subfamilies of structurally related domains, including the canonical DD, the death effector domain ( DED ), the caspase recruitment domain ( CARD ), and the pyrin domain ( PYD ). DD-containing proteins play central roles in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling through the formation of oligomeric protein complexes, and several disease-causing mutations have been mapped to DD interfaces ( Park et al., 2007 ). All DD complexes described so far involve homotypic interactions between DDs of the same subfamily ( e. g., DD with DD, CARD with CARD, etc. ). All known DD interactions belong to one of three types ( I to III ), each mediated by conserved asymmetric interfaces in the interacting DDs ( Park, 2011; Park et al., 2007; Weber and Vincenz, 2001 ). Heterotypic complexes between DDs from different subfamilies have not yet been described and, aside from a few structures of DDs bound to small polypeptides, no complexes of DDs with proteins outside the DD superfamily have been reported. Thus, type I, II, and III interactions between DDs are thought to represent the predominant mechanism of oligomerization and complex formation for DD-containing proteins. The cytoplasmic domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75NTR, also known as NGFR and TNFRSF16 ) contains a C-terminal DD connected to the transmembrane ( TM ) domain by a 60-residue-long linker region ( Liepinsh, 1997 ). p75NTR is a receptor for members of the neurotrophin family, such as nerve growth factor ( NGF ) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) ( Dechant and Barde, 2002; Roux and Barker, 2002 ). In addition to the neurotrophins, a number of other extracellular ligands can also engage or signal through p75NTR, including the beta-amyloid peptide ( Knowles et al., 2009; Perini et al., 2002 ), the rabies virus glycoprotein ( Tuffereau et al., 1998 ), and various myelin-derived polypeptides ( Wang et al., 2002; Wong et al., 2002 ). p75NTR may function alone or in conjunction with other transmembrane proteins to allow ligand binding and intracellular signaling. These proteins include members of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, members of the Vps10p family of sorting receptors, such as Sortilin, and the Nogo receptor, which promotes binding to myelin-derived ligands ( Underwood and Coulson, 2008 ). p75NTR can engage different intracellular pathways, of which the best characterized are the RhoA pathway, which regulates axon growth, collapse and degeneration ( Park et al., 2010; Yamashita et al., 1999; Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003 ), the NF-kB pathway, which contributes to cell survival ( Carter et al., 1996; Khursigara et al., 2001; Vicario et al., 2015 ), and the c-Jun kinase ( JNK ) or caspase pathway, which mediates apoptotic cell death ( Friedman, 2000; Yoon et al., 1998 ). p75NTR signaling through any of those three pathways requires a functional DD ( Charalampopoulos et al., 2012 ). Expression of p75NTR increases in a number of neurodegenerative diseases and upon injury or stress conditions, where it contributes to neuronal and glial cell damage, axonal degeneration, and synaptic dysfunction ( Ibanez and Simi, 2012 ). Inhibition of p75NTR signaling has emerged as an attractive strategy for limiting neural damage in neurodegeneration and nerve injury. The mechanism of activation of p75NTR in response to neurotrophins involves a conformational rearrangement of disulfide-linked receptor dimers, resulting in the separation of intracellular DDs ( Vilar et al., 2009 ). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) experiments have shown that the two DDs in the p75NTR dimer are in close proximity to each other ( high FRET state ) and that NGF binding induces a decrease in FRET signal ( Vilar et al., 2009 ). Disruption of this conformational change through mutation of a conserved cysteine residue in the TM domain prevents p75NTR signaling in response to neurotrophins ( Vilar et al., 2009 ). p75NTR lacks an associated catalytic activity. Similar to other members of the TNFRSF, signaling by p75NTR proceeds via ligand-induced recruitment and release of cytoplasmic effectors to and from its intracellular domain. Ligand-induced separation of p75NTR DDs may allow the recruitment of intracellular components for downstream signal propagation. Although a variety of intracellular proteins have been reported to interact with p75NTR, the molecular mechanisms by which the receptor engages different signaling pathways remain unclear. To begin addressing these questions, our laboratory performed a comprehensive structure\u2013function study of the p75NTR DD that resulted in the identification of three sets of solvent-exposed residues that are critical for p75NTR\u2019s ability to engage the RhoA, NF-kB and JNK/cell death pathways, respectively ( Charalampopoulos et al., 2012 ). Receptor mutants that are selectively deficient in one pathway but not others were generated, demonstrating that different signaling outputs can be genetically separated in p75NTR. Understanding how such interfaces relate to each other and to the mechanism of receptor activation has remained an important challenge. In this study, we have undertaken a structural biology approach to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying downstream signaling mediated by the DD in p75NTR. We have determined the solution structures of the p75NTR DD in complex with RhoGDI ( Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor ), which links the receptor to the RhoA pathway ( Yamashita et al., 1999; Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003 ), or with the CARD domain of RIP2 kinase, which is necessary for p75NTR coupling to the NF-kB pathway ( Charalampopoulos et al., 2012; Khursigara et al., 2001 ). We have also solved the solution structure of the p75NTR DD homodimer, revealing the DD surface that is occluded prior to neurotrophin-mediated receptor activation. These structures uncover novel heterotypic DD interactions, not previously seen in other DD-containing complexes, and reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of p75NTR activation and downstream signaling.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells have proteins called receptors on their surface that can bind to specific molecules on the outside of the cell. Typically, this binding activates the receptor and the activated receptor then triggers some biochemical changes inside the cell. For many receptors, the portion of the receptor inside the cell is essentially an enzyme that can trigger a biochemical change by itself. Some receptors, however, lack any enzymatic activity, and it is often unclear how these \u2018non-catalytic receptors\u2019 trigger changes inside a cell. A protein called p75 neurotrophin receptor ( or p75NTR for short ) is a non-catalytic receptor that is expressed when neurons are injured and its activity leads to the death of the neurons and related cells. Inhibiting this non-catalytic receptor is an attractive strategy for limiting the damage caused by diseases of the nervous system. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the activity of p75NTR are not well understood. Previous biochemical studies set out to answer the question of how p75NTR engages with components of the signaling machinery inside the cell, and found several components that interact with this receptor. Now, Lin et al. have tried to gain a more detailed understanding of those interactions at a molecular level. This involved solving the three-dimensional structures of three protein complexes that involve part of p75NTR ( called the \u201cdeath domain\u201d ) and one of two signaling components ( called RhoGDI and RIP2 ). Two of the protein complexes showed that RIP2 and RhoGDI bind to the receptor\u2019s death domain at partially overlapping sites, although RIP2 binds about 100 times more strongly than RhoGDI. A third protein complex showed an interaction between two copies of the death domain, which involves a surface of the receptor that overlaps with RIP2\u2019s, but not RhoGDI\u2019s, binding site. These structures, together with the results of other experiments, allowed Lin et al. to propose a model that could explain how p75NTR is activated. First, the two death domains must be separated. Next, RIP2 is recruited to the receptor, and outcompetes and displaces RhoGDI. This change in protein-protein interactions switches the receptor\u2019s signaling from one pathway to the other. Now that these structures are available, they can be used in future experiments to design specific changes in the receptor that would allow researchers to dissect its different activities ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nCancer cells display aneuploid karyotypes and typically mis-segregate chromosomes at high rates, a phenotype referred to as chromosomal instability ( CIN ). To test the effects of aneuploidy on chromosome segregation and other mitotic phenotypes we used the colorectal cancer cell line DLD1 ( 2n = 46 ) and two variants with trisomy 7 or 13 ( DLD1+7 and DLD1+13 ), as well as euploid and trisomy 13 amniocytes ( AF and AF+13 ). We found that trisomic cells displayed higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation compared to their euploid counterparts. Furthermore, cells with trisomy 13 displayed a distinctive cytokinesis failure phenotype. We showed that up-regulation of SPG20 expression, brought about by trisomy 13 in DLD1+13 and AF+13 cells, is sufficient for the cytokinesis failure phenotype. Overall, our study shows that aneuploidy can induce chromosome mis-segregation. Moreover, we identified a trisomy 13-specific mitotic phenotype that is driven by up-regulation of a gene encoded on the aneuploid chromosome.  Aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a leading cause of mis-carriage and birth defects in humans ( Nagaoka et al., 2012 ). In the vast majority of cases, this is due to errors occurring in the oocyte ( Nagaoka et al., 2012 ). However, aneuploidy can also arise in somatic cells, and a number of studies have reported age-dependent increases in aneuploidy in human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( Nowinski et al., 1990; Carere et al., 1999; Leopardi et al., 2002 ). Moreover, aneuploidy was recognized as a common feature of cancer cells already a century ago ( Boveri, 1914, 2008 ), and a causal role of aneuploidy in carcinogenesis is currently largely acknowledged ( reviewed in [Pavelka et al., 2010a; Nicholson and Cimini, 2011] ). In addition to being aneuploid, cancer cells typically display high rates of chromosome mis-segregation, a phenomenon termed chromosomal instability ( CIN ) ( Lengauer et al., 1997; Bakhoum et al., 2014 ). The observation that even mosaic aneuploidy can cause severe physical and cognitive developmental defects ( Biesecker and Spinner, 2013 ) indicates that aneuploidy has pleiotropic deleterious effects. This idea is further supported by a number of experimental observations: first, knocking down spindle assembly checkpoint genes, which results in high rates chromosome mis-segregation and high levels of aneuploidy, invariably causes embryonic lethality in mouse models ( Foijer et al., 2008 ). Second, aneuploid yeast strains were shown to exhibit defects in cell cycle progression and metabolism ( Torres et al., 2007 ). Third, MEFs derived from mice carrying specific trisomies were found to display cell proliferation defects and metabolic alterations ( Williams et al., 2008 ). Finally, genes involved in stress response were shown to be upregulated in aneuploid yeast and human cells ( Sheltzer et al., 2012; Stingele et al., 2012 ). But in the context of cancer, aneuploidy and CIN strongly correlate with drug resistance ( Lee et al., 2011 ) and poor patient prognosis ( Bardi et al., 2004; Carter et al., 2006; Walther et al., 2008; Sheffer et al., 2009 ), indicating that aneuploidy and CIN may confer a proliferative advantage to cancer cells. In support of this idea, certain aneuploidies were found to confer drug resistance in aneuploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Pavelka et al., 2010b ) and Candida albicans ( Selmecki et al., 2006, 2009 ). These studies suggest that aneuploidy may confer adaptability by inducing chromosome-specific phenotypic changes, despite general negative effects on cell physiology. However, this problem remains to be investigated in human cells. Recent work in aneuploid budding yeast also showed that aneuploidy is sufficient to cause CIN ( Sheltzer et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012 ), but whether this is true in human cells is still a matter of debate ( Duesberg, 2014; Heng, 2014; Valind and Gisselsson, 2014a, 2014b ). In fact, this question has been difficult to address in cancer cells due to the complexity of cancer karyotypes ( Gisselsson, 2011; Mitelman et al., 2014 ), and previous studies in human cancer and non-cancer cells have reached discrepant conclusions ( Lengauer et al., 1997; Duesberg et al., 1998; Miyazaki et al., 1999; Valind et al., 2013 ). To determine the effect of aneuploidy on chromosome segregation and cell division in human cells, we utilized a number of diploid human cell types and trisomic counterparts, including: colorectal cancer cell line DLD1 ( 2n = 46 ) and trisomic counterparts carrying extra copies of chromosomes 7 or 13 ( DLD1+7 and DLD1+13, respectively ) ; diploid amniotic fibroblasts ( AF ) and amniotic fibroblasts with trisomy 13 ( AF+13 ). These different cell types constitute a good model for our study for two main reasons: first, their karyotypes are aneuploid, but not as complex as typically found in tumors and cancer cell lines; second, they represent different cellular models ( transformed and untransformed ) of aneuploidy.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The DNA in a human cell is divided between forty-six structures called chromosomes. Before a cell divides, it copies every chromosome so that each daughter cell will have the same DNA as the parent cell. These chromosomes align in the center of the cell and then the matching chromosomes are separated and pulled to opposite ends. However, in some cases the separation process does not work properly, which can produce cells that either have too many, or too few, chromosomes. Abnormal numbers of chromosomes within cells\u2014called aneuploidy\u2014is a leading cause of miscarriage and birth defects in humans. Aneuploidy is also a common feature of cancer cells. It is common for the chromosomes in cancer cells to be distributed unequally when the cell divides. This phenomenon is known as chromosomal instability, but the link between aneuploidy and chromosomal instability in cancer cells is not fully understood. Here, Nicholson et al. used live-cell imaging techniques to analyze healthy human cells and cancer cells that had either the normal forty-six chromosomes, or a defined extra chromosome. Nicholson et al. found that when the cells divided, the chromosomes in the cells that had an extra copy of chromosome 7 or 13 were more prone to distributing chromosomes unequally, compared to cells with a normal number of chromosomes. Nicholson et al. also observed that the cells with an extra chromosome 13 were unable to properly divide into two. These cells had increased levels of a protein called Spartin\u2014which is important for the last stage in cell division\u2014and this was responsible for the failure to produce two daughter cells. These findings show that aneuploidy can cause chromosomal instability in human cells. Furthermore, Nicholson et al. have identified a defect in cell division that is specifically caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 13 in human cells. A future challenge will be to determine how, and to what extent, different chromosomes can affect chromosome stability. This could be useful in the development of therapies against cancer cells with aneuploidy ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nRNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC ) is composed of miRNAs and AGO proteins. AGOs use miRNAs as guides to slice target mRNAs to produce truncated 5' and 3' RNA fragments. The 5' cleaved RNA fragments are marked with uridylation for degradation. Here, we identified novel cofactors of Arabidopsis AGOs, named RICE1 and RICE2. RICE proteins specifically degraded single-strand ( ss ) RNAs in vitro; but neither miRNAs nor miRNA*s in vivo. RICE1 exhibited a DnaQ-like exonuclease fold and formed a homohexamer with the active sites located at the interfaces between RICE1 subunits. Notably, ectopic expression of catalytically-inactive RICE1 not only significantly reduced miRNA levels; but also increased 5' cleavage RISC fragments with extended uridine tails. We conclude that RICEs act to degrade uridylated 5\u2019 products of AGO cleavage to maintain functional RISC. Our study also suggests a possible link between decay of cleaved target mRNAs and miRNA stability in RISC.  RNA silencing is a fundamental mechanism for regulating gene expression in diverse biological contexts in eukaryotes. The key silencing effector is a ribonucleoprotein complex ( RISC ) that is composed of AGOs and small RNAs ( sRNAs ). sRNAs, including small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) and microRNAs ( miRNAs ), are produced by Dicers or Dicer-like enzymes as duplexes from longer fully-complementary double-stranded ( ds ) RNAs, or from ds RNAs with imperfectly-folded hairpin structures ( Achkar et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2009; Sanei and Chen, 2015 ). Subsequently, the sRNA duplexes are loaded into AGO proteins; and one strand ( siRNA passenger strand or miRNA* ) is ejected whereas the other ( siRNA guide strand or miRNA ) is retained in RISC. By using the retained sRNAs as guides, AGO proteins specify the correct target mRNAs and repress gene expression ( Chandradoss et al., 2015; Salomon et al., 2015 ). For targets with partial complementarity, silencing is initially primed through translational repression and followed by mRNA destabilization ( Bazzini et al., 2012; Djuranovic et al., 2012 ). Degradation of such an mRNA target is accomplished by a combination of deadenylation, decapping, and subsequently by 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic decay ( Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015 ). For highly complementary targets, RISC activity generally results in 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 cleavage fragments ( Bartel, 2009 ). Both 5\u2019 and 3 cleavage products undergo various decay processes. In mammals, the 3\u2019 cleavage fragments are canonically degraded in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction by an exonuclease 1 ( XRN1 ). In Arabidopsis, the 3\u2019 fragment is accumulated at a higher level in loss-of-function mutant of XRN4 compared with the amount in wild type ( Souret et al., 2004 ). Since Arabidopsis XRN4 is an ortholog of mammalian XRN1, the 5\u2019-to-3\u2019 decay of RISC 3\u2019 cleavage fragments appears to be implemented through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. RISC 5\u2019 cleavage fragments turn over rapidly reflected by the relative inability to detect them when compared with 3\u2019 cleavage fragments. However, the RNA decay mechanism for 5\u2019 cleavage fragments has remained unclear. Previous studies showed that 5\u2019 cleavage fragments from miRNA-RISC activity are typically uridylated at their 3\u2019 ends throughout eukaryotes; and that this nontemplated modification is a signature license for immediate decay ( Ren et al., 2014; Shen and Goodman, 2004 ). In human cells, the uridylation of the RISC 5\u2019 cleavage products is fulfilled through the terminal uridylyl transferases ( TUTs ) ( Lim et al., 2014 ). The uridylation promotes decapping of RISC 5\u2019 products, and subsequently 5\u2019-to-3\u2019 exonucleolytic decay by XRN1 ( Song and Kiledjian, 2007 ). In Arabidopsis, HEN1 suppressor 1 ( HESO1 ) uridylates the 5\u2019 fragments and stimulates their degradation, since a few 5\u2019-cleavage fragments display modest overaccumulation in heso1 mutants ( Ren et al., 2014 ). Notably, HESO1 was initially recovered as a miRNA nucleotidyl transferase. HESO1 functions together with UTP:RNA uridylyl transferase one to promote miRNA degradation in absence of canonical miRNA methylation ( Ren et al., 2012; Tu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015 ). In Arabidopsis, different pathways might account for RNA decay of RISC 5\u2019 cleavage fragments. It has been shown that 5\u2019 cleavage fragments accumulate in xrn4 mutant in Arabidopsis; and obviously XRN4 catalyzes 5\u2019-to-3\u2019 degradation of the fragments in a way similar to clearing RISC 3\u2019 fragments. The RNA exosome also appears to contribute to degrade the 5\u2019 cleavage fragments because their abundance is increased in the loss-of-function mutant of SKI2/3/8, Arabidopsis orthologs of RNA exosome subunits in yeast ( Branscheid et al., 2015 ). In contrast, accumulation of RISC 5\u2019 fragments is not enhanced in the mutants of additional subunits and even an Rrp6 ortholog, a core 3\u2019-to-5\u2019 exonuclease in the RNA exosome ( Branscheid et al., 2015 ). Therefore, whether these pathways represent the totality of mechanisms for degradation of uridylated 5\u2019 cleavage fragments remains elusive. miRNA targets not only serve as substrates for RISC activity, but also influence RISC function and miRNA stability. A pioneering study in plants shows that target mimicry can act as an endogenous decoy for miRNAs, resulting in unproductive RISC and miRNA destabilization ( Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007 ). Similar phenomena including miRNA sponges and competing endogenous mRNA ( ceRNAs ) that contain multiple miRNA-binding sites can modulate RISC activity and effectively inhibit miRNA function in animal systems ( Ebert and Sharp, 2010; Salmena et al., 2011; Rubio-Somoza et al., 2011 ). In these organisms, miRNAs recognize target mRNAs through seed pairing ( Bartel, 2009 ). Extensive pairing of 3\u2019 miRNAs to target RNAs triggers miRNA trimming and tailing and an accompanying loss of mature miRNAs ( Ameres et al., 2010; Xie et al., 2012 ). In human cells, highly complementary target RNAs destabilize the RISC and accelerate release of the guide RNA from AGO2 whereas partially complementary targets attenuate unloading of sRNAs and increase their stability ( De et al., 2013 ). Due to the presence of prevalent mismatches between the 3\u2019 end of a guide RNA and its target in mammals, the majority of identified miRNA targets do not destabilize the interaction ( Bartel, 2009 ). In contrast, plant miRNAs are nearly perfectly complementary to their target RNAs; and miRNA-RISC canonically functions to cleave target RNAs despite coherent presence of translation repression ( Li et al., 2013 ). However, whether RISC cleavage products regulate RISC function and miRNA abundance is unknown. Arabidopsis encodes nine functional AGOs, among which, AGO1 is a principal contributor to RNA silencing as it recruits most miRNAs, and a variety of siRNAs ( Mi et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011 ). AGO10 is the closest genetic paralog of AGO1, but functions to specifically sequester a group of miRNAs, miR165/166, to antagonize their silencing activity through AGO1 ( Zhu et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2017 ). Here, we successfully used proteomics analysis to identify a novel AGO10-bound partner, RICE1. We showed that RICE1 and its genetic paralog, RICE2, interacted with both AGO10 and AGO1, suggesting a common role in regulation of miRNA-RISC activity. RICE1 and RICE2 function as 3\u2019-to-5\u2019 exoribonucleases that specifically degraded ss RNAs. We found that overexpression of RICEs increased miRNA levels, whereas downregulation of RICE1 and\u00a0RICE2 through artificial miRNA technology decreased miRNA accumulation. We also determined the crystal structure of RICE1 and observed that it formed a homohexameric ring with the active sites uniquely embedded at the interface between monomers. We further pinpointed the critical residues required for RICE1 catalytic activity and oligomerization. Whereas oligomerization-defective RICE1 variants were unstable in vivo, introduction of catalytically-inactive RICE1 significantly reduced miRNA levels in vivo, reminiscent of loss-of-function mutants of rice1 rice2. Importantly, catalytically inactive RICE1 also caused the accumulation of longer uridylated 5\u2019 cleavage RNA fragments from RISC activity. We propose that RICE1 and RICE2 act to clear 5\u2019 uridylated fragments from RISC cleavage and to facilitate RISC recycling. Moreover, our study also suggests that the turnover of miRNA targets and miRNA accumulation might be related in vivo.

Cells must control how much RNA they produce in order to ensure that they develop properly and can respond well to their environment. RNA silencing refers to a collection of mechanisms that use smaller RNA molecules called microRNAs to incapacitate certain RNA molecules and selectively switch off the genes that encode them to stop more from being made. One key player in RNA silencing is the multi-protein complex called RISC, which contains microRNA and a group of proteins called AGOs. Once the microRNA has identified its RNA target, the AGOs cut the RNA into two pieces, known as the 5\u2019 cleavage fragment and 3\u2019 cleavage fragment. The two resulting fragments need to be cleared away swiftly, so that the RISC can move on to the next target. While it was known how the 3\u2019 cleavage fragment was removed, it was less clear how the 5\u2019 cleavage fragment was dealt with. Previous studies had shown that the 5\u2019 cleavage fragment was marked with a chemical called uridine, which somehow signals to the RISC that this fragment needs to be destroyed. Now, using biochemical techniques, Zhang et al. have identified two new proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis that attach to the AGO proteins and degrade the 5\u2019 cleavage fragments that are marked with uridine. The two proteins are named RICE1 and RICE2. Zhang et al. then analyzed the three-dimensional shape of RICE1 and identified the \u2018active\u2019 region that is responsible for degrading the RNA fragments. When these active regions were blocked, the microRNA levels were low, but the uridine-marked 5\u2019 cleavage fragments were high. Also, the RISC complex could not work properly, which lead to problems during the development of the plant. These results suggest that RICE proteins degrade 5\u2019 cleavage fragments modified with uridine to activate RISC. RICE proteins are conserved between plants and animals, and it is likely that their counterparts in humans will have a similar role to the plant proteins. The next challenge will be to explore how RICE proteins work in more details, which may lead to new ways to manipulate the levels of microRNAs to change the architecture of the plant and to improve their tolerance to various stress conditions ."}

Here, we show that EMD 57033 binds to an allosteric pocket in the myosin motor domain. EMD 57033-binding protects myosin against heat stress and thermal denaturation. In the presence of EMD 57033, ATP hydrolysis, coupling between actin and nucleotide binding sites, and actin affinity in the presence of ATP are increased more than 10-fold. Addition of EMD 57033 to heat-inactivated \u03b2-cardiac myosin is followed by refolding and reactivation of ATPase and motile activities. In heat-stressed cardiomyocytes expression of the stress-marker atrial natriuretic peptide is suppressed by EMD 57033. Thus, EMD 57033 displays a much wider spectrum of activities than those previously associated with small, drug-like compounds. Allosteric effectors that mediate refolding and enhance enzymatic function have the potential to improve the treatment of heart failure, myopathies, and protein misfolding diseases.  We used microscale thermophoresis to show that EMD 57033 binds purified \u03b2-cardiac myosin S1 with a stoichiometry of one molecule of EMD 57033 per myosin head with an affinity of 7. 3 \u00b1 1. 9 \u00b5M ( Figure 1A ). Direct binding of EMD 57033 to the motor domain was observed for Dictyostelium discoideum ( Dd ) myosin-2 and myosin-5 motor domain constructs but not for Dd myosin-1B, Dd myosin-1C, Dd myosin-1D, and Dd myosin-1E motor domain constructs. Myosin constructs that bind EMD 57033 display increased basal and actin-activated ATPase activity in the presence of the compound. The most potent interaction was observed with \u03b2-cardiac myosin with half-maximal activation ( AC50 ) observed at 7. 0 \u00b1 1. 5 \u00b5M EMD 57033 ( Table 1 ). The activation of skeletal muscle myosin-2 and Dd myosin-5 is twofold and fivefold weaker. Neither binding nor activation was observed for the ( \u2212 ) -enantiomer EMD 57439 ( Figure 1B ). The consequences of EMD 57033 binding on the turnover of ATP by actin-activated \u03b2-cardiac myosin were followed in single-turnover experiments. Using the extrinsic fluorescence probe 2\u2019-/3\u2019-O- ( N\u2019-methylanthraniloyl ) -ATP ( mantATP ) instead of ATP as substrate, we observed signal changes that can be attributed to three phases. The initial fast rise of fluorescence reflects the binding of the ATP analogue to the myosin active site, the following plateau phase monitors the duration of the hydrolysis reaction, and the third phase, corresponding to a decrease in fluorescence signal intensity, monitors the rate of product release. In the presence of EMD 57033, we observed an approximately twofold net increase in the rate of ATP turnover ( Figure 1C ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 003Figure 1. EMD 57033 binds to the myosin motor domain and activates ATPase and motor activities. ( A ) Direct interaction study between fluorescently labeled \u03b2-cardiac myosin S1, Dd myosin-2 motor domain, and Dd myosin-1C motor domain and EMD 57033. The myosin concentration was kept constant at 100 nM and EMD 57033 was titrated from 10 nM to 200 \u00b5M. The normalized thermophoresis signals were plotted against the EMD 57033 concentration. KD values were obtained by fitting the data to the Hill equation. Error bars indicate SD ( n = 3 ). ( B ) Dose-dependent activation of the actin-activated ATPase of \u03b2-cardiac myosin S1 by EMD 57033. Control measurements with the ( \u2212 ) -enantiomer EMD 57439 show no activation.

( D ) Fraction of active myosin heads in the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of EMD 57033 determined by active site titrations. Four \u03b2-cardiac myosin and four Dd myosin-2 preparations were compared. In the absence of EMD 57033 ( blue bars ) \u03b2-cardiac myosin preparations display between 34% and 74% and Dd myosin-2 preparations 76\u201392% activity. The fraction of active protein increased to 87\u2013100% following the addition of EMD 57033 ( 25 \u00b5M for \u03b2-cardiac myosin and 100 \u00b5M for Dd myosin-2 ). Addition of EMD 57033 to fully denatured myosin aggregates followed by incubation for 6 hr on ice or at 20\u00b0C produced no detectable recovery of enzymatic activity.

The number of experimentally accessible active sites is always smaller in preparations of purified enzymes than the number of active sites calculated based on protein concentration. The observed deviation results from incomplete folding, the presence of impurities, and the stress-induced partial loss of function during purification and storage. In the case of myosin, the amplitude of the fast rise in fluorescence intensity that follows binding of mantATP can be used to estimate the fraction of functional protein by active site titration ( Tsiavaliaris et al., 2002 ). Figure 1D shows the results of active site titrations for four typical preparations of \u03b2-cardiac myosin and a Dd myosin-2 motor domain construct. Dependent on the type of myosin, purification conditions, and length of storage, the fraction of active myosin heads varies between 32% and 92%. The fraction of active sites increased to 87\u201398% for the same enzyme preparations following the addition of EMD 57033. The increase in the number of binding-competent active sites is followed by a correlated increase in myosin ATPase activity ( Figure 1D, E ). In addition to the apparent conversion of inactive to catalytically competent myosin, ATPase activities measured in the presence of EMD 57033 correlate with the total number of myosin heads rather than the initial number of active myosin heads. Moreover, the measured ATPase activities exceed the values expected for a 100% active population of myosin heads by 30\u201350% ( Figure 1D ). To probe the effect of EMD 57033 on myosin motor activity, we performed in vitro motility assays. The sliding velocity of actin filaments increased 1. 8-fold for \u03b2-cardiac myosin ( Figure 1F ) and 1. 6-fold for a Dd myosin-2 motor domain construct ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ). In addition, the fraction of moving filaments increased from <75% to >95%. To examine whether EMD 57033 affects force production by \u03b2-cardiac myosin as well, we performed frictional loading experiments ( Greenberg and Moore, 2010 ). In initial experiments, we determined the minimal concentration of \u03b1-actinin molecules that generate sufficient load to stall the movement of actin filaments for a given surface density of myosin heads. In the presence of EMD 57033, the \u03b1-actinin concentration required to stall filament movement increased from 8 \u00b5g/ml to \u226512 \u00b5g/ml ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ). Next, we generated in vitro motility flow cells with actin filaments held at stall force. The addition of 25 \u03bcM EMD 57033 to these flow cells restarts filament movement. The time-dependence of the recovery of motile activity is best fit by a hyperbola. A plateau value of 0. 4 \u03bcm s\u22121 is reached after more than 2 hr ( Figure 1G ). Steady-state kinetic assays performed in the absence and the presence of EMD 57033 indicate an allosteric mode of action ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ). The binding site of EMD 57033 in the human \u03b2-cardiac myosin motor domain was further defined by molecular docking experiments in combination with direct binding studies using myosin motor domain constructs with alterations in the predicted binding region. Initial blind docking to homology models of the \u03b2-cardiac myosin motor domain in the post-rigor state indicated preferred binding of the drug to a region near the small N-terminal, SH3-like \u03b2barrel subdomain. Important contacts are predicted to involve the SH3-like subdomain ( residues 34\u201372 ) and two \u03b1-helices ( residues 20\u201328 and 98\u2013111 ). The mode of binding and the orientation of EMD 57033 in this pocket were further analyzed using a flexible, targeted docking procedure. Rearrangements in the side chains of residues Arg29 and Lys34 are predicted to bring these two amino acids into the close vicinity of polar groups in EMD 57033. The identified binding pocket exhibits a Y shape, supporting two slightly different clusters of binding poses of EMD 57033 with predicted binding free energies in the range of \u221211 to \u221212 kcal mol\u22121. The sets of binding poses differ mainly in the orientation of the dimethylated catechol group, occupying either of the two possible branches of the Y, while the thiadiazinone moiety appears little affected and resides in the root of the Y shaped cavity ( Figure 2A, B ). Potential residues involved in the binding of the thiadiazinone and tetrahydroquinoline moieties of the compound include Arg23, Asp85, Lys86, Asp107, Arg108, and Ser111. The dimethylated catechol moiety is mainly bound by residues Lys34, Lys48, and Gln79, and thus, interacts with the SH3-like \u03b2-barrel. The contribution of residues from the SH3-like \u03b2-barrel to EMD 57033 binding is in good agreement with our observation that all class-1 myosins tested, which lack this subdomain, fail to bind EMD 57033 ( Table 1 ). To verify that the SH3-like \u03b2-barrel is necessary to mediate EMD 57033 binding, we performed direct binding, ATPase, and in vitro motility assays with Dd myosin-2 \u0394SH3, a recombinant motor domain construct that lacks this subdomain ( Fujita-Becker et al., 2006 ). We observed neither binding of EMD 57033 to Dd myosin-2 \u0394SH3 nor EMD 57033-induced activation of the constructs chemomechanical activity ( Figure 2C, D and Table 1 ). Further studies using point mutations that eliminate key residues predicted to interact with EMD 57033 are needed to confirm the binding site. 10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 007Figure 2. Localization of the EMD 57033 binding pocket. ( A ) Predicted binding of EMD 57033 near the base of the lever arm as obtained by molecular docking. The overview of the Hs \u03b2-cardiac myosin head domain includes residues 1\u2013800. Two slightly different clusters of binding poses were identified for EMD 57033 with comparable binding affinities. ( B ) Close-up of the allosteric binding pocket shown in surface representation. The Y shape of the pocket is outlined and the two residues\u2014Arg29 and Lys34\u2014that were allowed full conformational flexibility during docking are colored red. For clarity only the best poses for the two identified clusters of binding modes are shown. Hydrogen bonds of EMD 57033 to the motor protein are shown in magenta. ( C ) The SH3-like subdomain is required for EMD 57033 binding and myosin activation. A truncated Dd myosin-2 motor domain construct without SH3-like \u03b2-barrel shows no significant activation in the presence of 100 \u03bcM EMD 57033. Errors indicate SD ( n = 4 ). ( D ) In contrast to the wild-type Dd myosin-2 motor domain construct, no actin filament sliding velocity enhancement was observed upon addition of 100 \u00b5M EMD 57033 to the construct with truncated N-terminal SH3-like \u03b2-barrel.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 008 To gain a better understanding of its mechanism of action, we examined the effect of EMD 57033-binding on the kinetic activity of the myosin motor. The effect of EMD 57033 on individual steps of the ATPase cycle of \u03b2-cardiac myosin was analyzed with the help of transient kinetic measurements and evaluated according to the model shown in Figure 3A, Scheme 1. Upon addition of 25 \u00b5M EMD 57033 to \u03b2-cardiac myosin, we observed a 1. 6-fold increase in kcat, the maximum rate of ATP turnover, and a 10-fold decrease in KM ( actin ), the F-actin concentration necessary for half-maximal activation ( Figure 3B ). The extent to which coupling between the actin and nucleotide binding sites is improved in the presence of EMD 57033 is indicated by the resulting 16-fold increase in the apparent second-order rate constant ( kcat/KM ( actin ) ) for the actin-activated ATPase activity ( Table 2 ). Fast mixing of excess ATP with \u03b2-cardiac myosin results in an increase of the protein\u2019s intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The kinetic model predicts the double exponential \u2018behavior\u2019 of the observed transients to be associated with two discrete processes ( Figure 3C ). The fast process corresponds to the binding of ATP to the active site. The rate of the slow process saturates at ATP concentrations above 100 \u00b5M and can be attributed to the ATP hydrolysis step ( Deacon et al., 2012 ). Accordingly, EMD 57033 triggers a 3. 4-fold increase in the second order rate constant for ATP binding ( K1k+2 ), a 3. 8-fold increase in the rate of the subsequent conformational change ( k+2 ), and a 12. 9-fold increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis ( k+3 + k\u22123 ) ( Figure 3D, E and Table 2 ). Phosphate release is the rate-limiting step of the \u03b2-cardiac myosin actin-activated ATPase cycle. It can be monitored by the fluorescence increase that is associated with the much faster binding of phosphate to the A197C mutant of Escherichia coli phosphate binding protein, labeled at Cys197 with the thiol reactive coumarin dye MDCC ( Brune et al., 1994 ) ( Figure 3F ). The observed transients in the absence and presence of EMD 57033 were best fitted by single exponential functions. The resulting values for k+4 indicate a 1. 7-fold increase in the presence of the small compound. The subsequent ADP-release step ( k\u2212D, k\u2212AD ) appears unaffected by EMD 57033-binding ( Table 2 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 009Figure 3.

Rate constants are referred to as k+n and k\u2212n and are assigned to the corresponding forward and reverse reactions.

In the presence of 25 \u00b5M EMD 57033, the plateau value representing kcat is 1. 6-fold increased and the apparent actin affinity KM ( Actin ), indicated by the half-maximal activation of ATPase activity, is 10-fold increased ( values are given in Table 2 ). Errors indicate SD ( n = 5 ). ( C ) EMD 57033-mediated increase in the rate of ATP binding and hydrolysis. The fast phase of the biphasic transients correspond to ATP binding, the slow phase can be attributed to ATP hydrolysis. ( D ) EMD 57033-mediated changes in the rate of ATP binding.

To assess the effect of EMD 57033 on the activation energy of ATP turnover by \u03b2-cardiac myosin, we recorded the temperature dependence of the reaction over the range 25\u201345\u00b0C. The resulting Arrhenius plot shows that EMD 57033 affects the slope of the recorded linear dependencies, indicating that the Arrhenius energy ( Ea ) is decreased from 47 kJ mol\u22121 to 31 kJ mol\u22121 in the presence of the small-compound ( Figure 3G and Table 2 ). Equilibrium binding of ligands leads to a shift of the midpoint of the thermal transition Tm, which corresponds to the temperature at which half of all protein molecules are in the native state and the remaining half are in the denatured state. Typically, the extent of the observed increase in protein thermal stability is proportional to the concentration and affinity of the added ligand. The Tm measured for the Dd myosin-2 motor domain corresponds to 45. 6 \u00b1 0. 2\u00b0C in the absence of nucleotide and 52. 7 \u00b1 0. 2\u00b0C in the presence of 400 \u00b5M Mg2+-ADP\u2022BeF3 ( Ponomarev et al., 2000 ). In the case of the \u03b2-cardiac myosin motor domain, we measured Tm values of 45. 8 \u00b1 2. 2\u00b0C ( nucleotide-free ) and 52. 0 \u00b1 0. 8\u00b0C ( +100 \u00b5M Mg2+-ATP ) in low salt buffer and 46. 5 \u00b1 1. 1\u00b0C ( nucleotide-free ) and 54. 1 \u00b1 0. 9\u00b0C ( +100 \u00b5M Mg2+-ATP ) in high salt buffer, respectively. The addition of a saturating concentration of EMD 57033 to nucleotide-free \u03b2-cardiac myosin motor domain shifts the Tm to 53. 6 \u00b1 1. 9\u00b0C ( low salt ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and for the complex with F-actin from 55. 5 \u00b1 3\u00b0C to 66. 4 \u00b1 3\u00b0C ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ). However, the EMD 57033-mediated activation and conversion of inactive to catalytically competent myosin ( Figure 1C, D ) and the greatly improved preservation of enzymatic activity during storage ( Figure 4A ) indicate that EMD 57033 is more potent in preventing the precipitation and irreversible denaturation of the protein than suggested by the shift in Tm alone. 10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 011Figure 4. EMD 57033 acts as a pharmacological chaperone. ( A ) The presence of 25 \u00b5M EMD 57033 extends the shelf life of Hs \u03b2-cardiac myosin at 4\u00b0C. Errors indicate SD ( n = 3 ).

In the presence of EMD 57033 \u03b2-cardiac myosin remained in the supernatant over the entire temperature range tested. Incubation for 10 min at 49\u00b0C leads to the almost complete loss of catalytic activity. The ability to bind mantATP is gradually recovered following the addition of 25 \u00b5M EMD 57033.

Light scattering was followed along a temperature gradient from 25\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C in the absence and presence of 100 \u00b5M EMD 57033. The mid-points of the observed transitions correspond to approximately 55. 5\u00b0C in the absence and 66. 4\u00b0C in its presence of EMD 57033. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 013 To elucidate the mode of action of EMD 57033, we submitted myosin constructs in the absence and presence of the compound to heat stress and followed the resulting changes in solubility and functional competence. The fraction of myosin that is able to bind mantATP drops to below 32% when the temperature is raised to 49\u00b0C for more than 5 min. Incubation for 10 min at 51\u00b0C removes the myosin completely and irreversibly from the soluble fraction. Preincubation of the myosin with 25 \u03bcM EMD 57033 before exposure to heat-stress prevents precipitation ( Figure 4B, insert ). Moreover, based on the amplitude of the rise in mantATP fluorescence, the competence of \u03b2-cardiac myosin to bind nucleotide is preserved to more than 91% after 5-min incubation at 49\u00b0C and to approximately 82% after 10-min incubation at 49\u00b0C ( Figure 4B ). The apparent large reduction in the rate of mantATP binding and the extended plateau phase suggest that the observed transients report a rate-limiting step in the refolding of the \u03b2-cardiac myosin motor rather than the rate of nucleotide binding ( see Figure 1B for comparison ). This view is supported by experiments that monitor the recovery of basal activity over a 2 hr period ( Figure 4C ). To obtain more detailed information about the kinetics of the EMD 57033-mediated refolding reaction, we performed three sets of experiments recording the time and concentration dependence of EMD 57033-mediated increases in the fraction of myosin molecules that are able to undergo nucleotide induced conformational changes, hydrolyze ATP, and produce movement in the in vitro motility assay. Changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence are tightly linked to ATP binding and ATP-induced conformational changes in the myosin motor domain ( Batra and Manstein, 1999 ). Therefore, the progress of the refolding reaction can be estimated by incubating heat-inactivated \u03b2-cardiac myosin with EMD 57033 and recording the change in intrinsic protein fluorescence that follows the addition of substoichiometric amounts of ATP ( Figure 4D ) and excess ATP ( Figure 4E ) at predefined time points over the next two hours. The dependence of the kobs values on the incubation time was best fit by a hyperbola ( Figure 4E ). Refolding and reactivation of ATPase activity and motility were measured in the presence of 10\u2013100 \u03bcM EMD 57033. In each experimental setting the data obtained for a specific EMD 57033 concentration were best fit by hyperbolae ( Figure 4F, G ). The recovery of motor activity upon addition of EMD 57033 to flow cells is shown in Video 1 and Video 2. The kobs values derived from the hyperbolae determined for EMD 57033-mediated changes in ATPase activity and motility ( Figure 4F, G ) and from changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence ( data not shown ) indicate a linear dependence between the progress of the refolding reaction and the concentration of EMD 57033. The slope defines a value of 0. 02 \u00d7 10-3 \u03bcM\u22121 s\u22121 for the second order rate constant for the EMD 57033-mediated refolding reaction ( Figure 4H ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 014Video 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 015 Our studies provide evidence for a pro-hypertrophic effect of EMD 57033 ( Figure 5A, B ). After 1 day exposure to 10 \u03bcM EMD 57033 in serum-free growth medium, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes ( NRCM ) displayed a 1. 8- and 1. 4-fold increase in cell size without significant changes in \u03b1-cardiac MHC transcripts and a reduction in \u03b2-cardiac MHC transcripts without significant changes in total cardiac MHC protein content compared to controls ( Figure 5C\u2013F ). Atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) has been described as a marker that rapidly responds to increased cardiac strain and stress induced by hyperthermia ( Aggeli et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2012 ). ANP expression was not significantly changed in NRCM treated with 10 \u03bcM EMD 57033 ( Figure 5G ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 016Figure 5.

EMD 57033 does not alter \u03b1-cardiac MHC mRNA expression compared to DMSO controls. Incubation at 42\u00b0C significantly reduces expression of \u03b1-cardiac MHC mRNA in NRCM compared to cells that were incubated at 37\u00b0C. The decrease in \u03b1-cardiac MHC mRNA upon induction of hyperthermia was not affected by EMD 57033 treatment. Errors indicate SD ( n = 3 ).

Treatment with EMD 57033 significantly reduces \u03b2-cardiac MHC expression at 37\u00b0C compared to DMSO controls. Incubation at 42\u00b0C for 24 hr results in downregulation of \u03b2-cardiac MHC mRNA. Downregulation is significantly more pronounced in EMD 57033-treated cells. Errors indicate SD ( n = 3 ).

Incubation of NRCM at 42\u00b0C induces mRNA expression of ANP in DMSO-treated control cells, which is completely suppressed by treatment with EMD 57033. Errors indicate SD ( n = 3 ). NRCM were treated with EMD 57033 ( 10 \u00b5M ) or the solvent DMSO ( 1 \u00b5l/ ml ) alone for 24 hr in serum-free conditions. Significances are coded as follows: *p<0. 05, **p<0. 01 und ***p<0. 001 for the DMSO control vs EMD 57033 at a specific temperature; #p<0. 05, ##p<0. 01 und ###p<0. 001 for a specific group at different temperatures. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01603. 016 Hyperthermic stress for 24 hr did not significantly alter cell size or MHC total protein content in NRCM but reduced transcript levels of both \u03b1- and \u03b2-cardiac MHC ( Figure 5C\u2013F ). The reduction of \u03b2-cardiac MHC remained more pronounced in the EMD-treated NRCM without affecting MHC protein content ( Figure 5 ). Hyperthermic stress-induced ANP expression in controls, while the presence of 10 \u03bcM EMD 57033 fully suppressed the expression of ANP during hyperthermic stress ( Figure 5G ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Our muscles contain large numbers of \u2018motor proteins\u2019 called myosins. To contract a muscle, many myosin molecules expend energy to \u2018walk\u2019 along a filament made from another molecule, called actin, and generate a pulling force. Like other proteins, myosins must fold into the correct shape to work, but high temperatures or other types of stress can disrupt their ability to adopt or maintain the correct shape. Misfolding of myosins, for example, can result in muscular diseases, including those that affect the heart; so there is an ongoing effort to find compounds that can stabilize protein folding and treat these diseases. The small molecule EMD 57033 was discovered over 20 years ago, and its ability to increase the strength of muscle contractions suggested that it could be used to treat chronic heart failure, but the risk of side effects limited its clinical use. The effectiveness of other compounds that improve cardiac muscle function is still routinely compared to EMD 57033, however the exact mechanism responsible for its effect on muscle tissue remained unknown. Now Radke, Taft et al. have identified the part of the myosin protein that EMD 57033 binds to, and shown how this activates muscle contraction. The experiments also, unexpectedly, revealed that EMD 57033 is able to convert misfolded myosin back into the fully functional form. By revealing this refolding effect, the findings of Radtke, Taft et al. suggest that similar small molecules could be used as drugs for the treatment of protein misfolding diseases, muscular diseases, and heart failure ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nLittle is known about enteropathogen seroepidemiology among children in low-resource settings. We measured serological IgG responses to eight enteropathogens ( Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella enterica, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter jejuni, norovirus ) in cohorts from Haiti, Kenya, and Tanzania. We studied antibody dynamics and force of infection across pathogens and cohorts. Enteropathogens shared common seroepidemiologic features that enabled between-pathogen comparisons of transmission. Overall, exposure was intense: for most pathogens the window of primary infection was <3 years old; for highest transmission pathogens primary infection occurred within the first year. Longitudinal profiles demonstrated significant IgG boosting and waning above seropositivity cutoffs, underscoring the value of longitudinal designs to estimate force of infection. Seroprevalence and force of infection were rank-preserving across pathogens, illustrating the measures provide similar information about transmission heterogeneity. Our findings suggest antibody response can be used to measure population-level transmission of diverse enteropathogens in serologic surveillance.  A broad set of viral, bacterial, and parasitic enteropathogens are leading causes of the global infectious disease burden, with the highest burden among young children living in lower income countries ( GBD 2016 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2016 ). Infections that result in acute diarrhea and related child deaths drive disease burden estimates attributed to enteropathogens, but asymptomatic infections are extremely common and the full scope of sequelae is only partially understood ( Liu et al., 2016; Platts-Mills et al., 2018 ). Much of what we know about enteropathogen transmission is based on passive clinical surveillance, which reflects a small fraction of all infections. For example, antibody-based incidence of infection to Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni were 2\u20136 orders of magnitude higher than case-based surveillance in European populations ( Simonsen et al., 2008; Falkenhorst et al., 2012; Teunis et al., 2012; Teunis et al., 2013 ), and a study of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi in Fiji found similarly high discordance between antibody-based incidence and case-based surveillance ( Watson et al., 2017 ). A more complete picture of enteropathogen infection in populations would help understand drivers of transmission, disease burden, naturally acquired immunoprotection, as well as to design public health prevention measures, and measure intervention effects. Stool-based, high-throughput PCR assays have helped solve the logistical difficulties of single-pathogen testing for enterics and have provided new insights into pathogen-specific infections and disease burden ( Liu et al., 2016; Platts-Mills et al., 2018 ). Yet, stool is not routinely collected in population-based surveys, and infection with many globally important enteric pathogens can be sufficiently rare and relatively short-lived to require designs with almost continuous surveillance ( Platts-Mills et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018 ). At the same time, large-scale serological surveillance platforms create new opportunities for expanded enteropathogen surveillance alongside other infectious diseases ( Metcalf et al., 2016; Arnold et al., 2018 ). These challenges and opportunities have generated interest in antibody-based measurement as a complement to PCR for population-based enteropathogen surveillance ( Griffin et al., 2011; Exum et al., 2016; Moss et al., 2014; Arnold et al., 2017 ), and for endpoints in observational and randomized studies ( Crump et al., 2007; Zambrano et al., 2017; Chard et al., 2018; Vargas et al., 2017; Mosites et al., 2018; Wade et al., 2018; Egorov et al., 2018 ). After infection, many enteropathogens elicit a transiently elevated antibody response that wanes over time. In lower transmission settings where antibody responses could be monitored longitudinally after distinct infections, Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia intestinalis ( syn. Giardia lamblia, Giardia duodenalis ) immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) levels in blood have been shown to wane over a period of months since infection; IgM and IgA levels decline even more quickly ( Teunis et al., 2012; Strid et al., 2001; Priest et al., 2001; Priest et al., 2010; Falkenhorst et al., 2013; Hj\u00f8llo et al., 2018 ). Compared with permanently immunizing infections such as measles, transient immunity adds a layer of complexity to seroepidemiologic inference and methods. To our knowledge, there has been no detailed study of enteropathogen seroepidemiology among children in low-resource settings where transmission is intense beginning early in life ( Platts-Mills et al., 2018 ). Such studies are needed to determine if serology is a viable approach to measure enteropathogen transmission in low-resource settings. We conducted a series of analyses in cohorts from Haiti, Tanzania, and Kenya that measured serological antibody responses to eight enteropathogens using multiplex bead assays. Our objectives were to identify common patterns in antibody dynamics shared across enteropathogens and populations, and to evaluate serological methods to compare between-pathogen heterogeneity in infection, including estimates of force of infection. Our results provide new insights into the seroepidemiology of enteropathogens among children living in low-resource settings, and contribute advances to inform the design and analysis of surveillance efforts whose goal is to quantify heterogeneity in enteropathogen transmission through antibody response.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Diarrhea, which is caused by bacteria such as Salmonella or by viruses like norovirus, is the fourth leading cause of death among children worldwide, with children in low-resource settings being at highest risk. The pathogens that cause diarrhea spread when stool from infected people comes into contact with new hosts, for example, through inadequate sanitation or by drinking contaminated water. Currently, the best way to track these infections is to collect stool samples from people and test them for the presence of the pathogens. Unfortunately, this is costly and difficult to do on a large scale outside of clinical settings, making it hard to track the spread of diarrhea-causing pathogens. The body produces antibodies \u2013 small proteins that can detect specific pathogens \u2013 in response to an infection. These antibodies help ward off future infections by the same pathogen, so if they are present in the blood, this indicates a current or previous infection. Scientists already collect blood samples to track malaria, HIV and vaccine-preventable diseases in low-resource settings. These samples could be tested more broadly to measure the levels of antibodies against diarrhea-causing pathogens. Now, Arnold et al. have used blood samples collected from children in Haiti, Kenya, and Tanzania to measure antibody responses to 8 diarrhea-causing pathogens. The results showed that many children in these settings had been infected with all 8 pathogens before age three, and that all of the pathogens shared similar age-dependent patterns of antibody response. This finding enabled Arnold et al. to combine antibody measurements with statistical models to estimate each pathogen\u2019s force of infection, that is, the rate at which susceptible individuals in the population become infected. This is a key step for epidemiologists to understand which pathogens cause the most infections in a population. The experiments show that testing blood samples for antibodies could provide scientists with a new tool to track the transmission of diarrhea-causing pathogens in low-resource settings. This information could help public health officials design and test efforts to prevent diarrhea, for example, by improving water treatment or developing vaccines ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nCells harbor two systems for fatty acid synthesis, one in the cytoplasm ( catalyzed by fatty acid synthase, FASN ) and one in the mitochondria ( mtFAS ). In contrast to FASN, mtFAS is poorly characterized, especially in higher eukaryotes, with the major product ( s ), metabolic roles, and cellular function ( s ) being essentially unknown. Here we show that hypomorphic mtFAS mutant mouse skeletal myoblast cell lines display a severe loss of electron transport chain ( ETC ) complexes and exhibit compensatory metabolic activities including reductive carboxylation. This effect on ETC complexes appears to be independent of protein lipoylation, the best characterized function of mtFAS, as mutants lacking lipoylation have an intact ETC. Finally, mtFAS impairment blocks the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts in vitro. Together, these data suggest that ETC activity in mammals is profoundly controlled by mtFAS function, thereby connecting anabolic fatty acid synthesis with the oxidation of carbon fuels.  Fatty acids play diverse cellular roles, including providing the hydrophobic tails of membrane phospholipids, energy storage in the form of triglycerides, and as cell signaling molecules. Aside from the import of exogenous fatty acids, mammalian cells use the well-known and well-studied cytoplasmic enzyme fatty acid synthase ( FASN ) to make palmitate, which is further modified to form the diverse array of cellular fatty acids ( Smith, 1994 ). However, it is much less appreciated that mitochondria also harbor a spatially and genetically distinct fatty acid synthesis pathway ( mtFAS ) ( reviewed in Nowinski et al., 2018 ). In contrast to FASN, which is a very large protein that contains several domains and encompasses all of the enzymatic activities necessary for FAS condensed in a single polypeptide chain, the mtFAS pathway is comprised of at least six enzymes all encoded by separate genes. These enzymes catalyze sequential steps to achieve one cycle of two-carbon addition to a growing acyl chain ( Figure 1A ). The nascent fatty acids are covalently attached to the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein ( ACP ), which acts as a soluble scaffold upon which the acyl chains are built. In each cycle of the pathway, malonyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-ACP, which then undergoes a condensation reaction with the growing fatty acyl chain on ACP, extending the chain by two carbons and releasing a CO2 molecule. Thereafter, the remaining enzymes in the pathway must carry out a series of reduction and dehydration reactions to fully reduce the acyl chain to a saturated fatty acid, which is the substrate for further cycles of two-carbon addition. Among the several differences between mtFAS and cytoplasmic FAS, FASN exclusively produces palmitate, whereas mtFAS appears to have at least two major products. Although the human genes responsible for each step in the mtFAS pathway have been identified, and their ability to complement the orthologous mutants in yeast has been demonstrated ( Autio et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Joshi et al., 2003; Miinalainen et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2003 ), few loss-of-function studies have examined the consequences of mtFAS deficiency in mammalian systems. Inducible knockout of the mitochondrial malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase ( Mcat ) using a Cre driver that expresses in most tissues in mice results in a severe phenotype characterized by weight loss, reduced muscle strength, and shortened lifespan despite the persistence of residual MCAT protein ( Smith et al., 2012 ). Knockout of the mitochondrial 2-enoyl thioester reductase, Mecr, is lethal in mice due to a placental defect ( Nair et al., 2017 ), while the inducible knockout of Mecr specifically in Purkinje cells leads to loss of this cell population and recapitulates many phenotypes of MePaN syndrome, the human disease caused by Mecr mutation ( Gorukmez et al., 2019; Heimer et al., 2016; Nair et al., 2018 ). Similarly, Mecr knockdown has been shown to inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells ( Cai et al., 2019 ). While these detrimental phenotypes are clear, the molecular consequences of mtFAS loss remain poorly understood. MtFAS currently has one known product: an eight-carbon saturated fatty acid, octanoate, that is subsequently converted to lipoic acid. This important cofactor is required for the catalytic activity of a number of mitochondrial enzymes, most notably pyruvate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase ( Brody et al., 1997; Wada et al., 1997 ), but also branched chain amino acid dehydrogenase, the H protein of the glycine cleavage system, and 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase ( reviewed in Solmonson and DeBerardinis, 2018 ). This observation, made more than 20 years ago, has guided mtFAS-focused research for the past two decades. Studies have shown that loss of lipoic acid synthesis and/or failure to efficiently transfer lipoic acid to its target proteins is lethal in mice ( Ni et al., 2019; Yi and Maeda, 2005 ), and attributed other mitochondrial changes as downstream of lipoic acid synthesis ( Smith et al., 2012 ). However, though the mouse studies described above have demonstrated striking phenotypes that result from loss of mtFAS, they fail to distinguish between direct effects of loss of protein lipoylation versus loss of other mtFAS function ( s ). Although lipoic acid unmistakably has important central functions in mitochondrial metabolism, there is reason to be skeptical that the sole function of mtFAS is the production of lipoic acid. In addition to the eight-carbon precursor for lipoic acid, it is clear that mtFAS also produces longer acyl chains of at least 14 carbons, yet the identity of these lipids and their cellular functions are uncertain ( Angerer et al., 2017; Witkowski et al., 2007 ). Perhaps more surprisingly, these longer acyl chains appear to partially be maintained in attachment to ACP ( Angerer et al., 2017 ), further complicating the question of their cellular functions. We set out to systematically examine the cellular functions of the mtFAS pathway by mutating genes that encode three distinct steps in the pathway, Mcat, Oxsm, and Mecr. For comparison, we also engineered cells with loss of Lipt1, the terminal enzyme in the production of lipoylated enzymes downstream of mtFAS. We found that several phenotypes resulting from loss of the mtFAS pathway are not related to lipoic acid, but must instead be due to loss of other products or functions of mtFAS. In particular, we find that loss of mtFAS, but not lipoic acid synthesis, leads to a profound impairment in the assembly of the mitochondrial electron transport chain machinery, with the attendant consequences on metabolism and cell behaviors. Our data therefore suggest that the mtFAS pathway acts as a key regulator of mitochondrial respiratory metabolism.

Eukaryotic cells have two systems that make the building blocks of fats ( known as fatty acids ) and one of these systems, called the mtFAS pathway, operates in small compartments known as mitochondria. This pathway only has one known product, a small fat molecule called lipoic acid, which mitochondria attach to several enzymes to allow them to work properly. The main role of mitochondria is to break down fats and other molecules to release chemical energy that powers many processes in cells. They achieve this using large groups of proteins known as ETC complexes. To build these complexes, families of proteins known as ETC assembly factors carefully coordinate the assembly of many proteins and small molecules into specific structures. However, it remains unclear precisely how this process works. Here, Nowinski et al. used a gene editing technique to mutate the genes encoding three enzymes in the mtFAS pathway in mammalian cells. The experiments found that the mutant cells had fewer ETC complexes and seemed to be less able to break down fats and other molecules than \u2018normal\u2019 cells. Furthermore, a family of ETC assembly factors were less stable in the mutant cells. These findings suggest that the mtFAS pathway controls how mitochondria assemble ETC complexes. Further experiments indicated that lipoic acid is not involved in the assembly of ETC complexes and that the mtFAS pathway produces another, as yet unidentified, product that regulates this process, instead. MEPAN syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that leads to progressive loss of control of movement, slurred speech and impaired vision in children. Patients with this syndrome have genetic mutations affecting components of the mtFAS pathway, therefore, a better understanding of how the pathway works may help researchers develop new treatments in the future. More broadly, these findings will have important ramifications for many other situations in which the activity of ETC complexes in mitochondria is modified ."}

This signal activation occurs only when pathogenic RNA is identified, despite the ability of RIG-I to bind endogenous RNA while surveying the cytoplasm. Here we show that ATP binding and hydrolysis by RIG-I play a key role in the identification of viral targets and the activation of signaling. Using biochemical and cell-based assays together with mutagenesis, we show that ATP binding, and not hydrolysis, is required for RIG-I signaling on viral RNA. However, we show that ATP hydrolysis does provide an important function by recycling RIG-I and promoting its dissociation from non-pathogenic RNA. This activity provides a valuable proof-reading mechanism that enhances specificity and prevents an antiviral response upon encounter with host RNA molecules.  Retinoic acid-inducible gene I ( RIG-I ) is a cellular innate immune receptor that recognizes viral ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) in the cytoplasm and consequently initiates a host defense response ( Yoneyama et al., 2004; Ablasser et al., 2009; Baum et al., 2010 ). The RIG-I protein is comprised of three major domain groups, including tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains ( CARDs ) that mediate signaling, a modified DExD/H-box ATPase core, and a C-terminal domain ( CTD ) that provides RNA ligand specificity through high-affinity interaction with blunt-ended, triphosphorylated duplexes ( Hornung et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2011; Kowalinski et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2011, 2012b; Rawling et al., 2015 ). RIG-I surveys the cytoplasm in an autorepressed conformation, with the CARDs stacked against the helicase core ( Kowalinski et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2015 ) ( Figure 1 ). Upon RNA ligand recognition, the protein adopts a conformation that can bind and hydrolyze ATP ( Yoneyama et al., 2004; Cui et al., 2008; Gee et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2011; Kowalinski et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2011 ). These combined activities result in liberation of the CARDs for interaction with the adapter protein MAVS, causing MAVS oligomerization and subsequent downstream signaling ( Hou et al., 2011; Peisley et al., 2014; Rawling and Pyle, 2014 ) ( Figure 1 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 09391. 003Figure 1. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I ( RIG-I ) signaling activation by viral ribonucleic acid ( RNA ). The RIG-I protein is comprised of four major domain groups including the caspase activation and recruitment domains ( CARDs ) ( black ), and RNA-stimulated ATPase core ( green ), a helical regulatory and binding domain inserted into the second lobe of the ATPase called HEL2i ( cyan ), and a triphosphate recognition and RNA binding domain at the c-terminus annotated the C-terminal domain ( CTD ) ( orange ). RIG-I is normally present in cells in an autorepressed conformation with the CARDs stacked against the HEL2i domain. Upon infection by a subset of RNA and DNA viruses, RIG-I binds 5\u2032 triphosphorylated duplex termini of viral RNA ( black helix with three white circles ) deposited or transcribed in the cytoplasm. RNA binding stimulates ATP ( yellow star ) binding and hydrolysis by RIG-I to ADP ( yellow triangle ). At some point in this process, RIG-I becomes competent to engage an immune signaling response through an interaction with the adaptor protein MAVS ( red ), however the determinant step for signaling has not been conclusively demonstrated. Thus, the transition of RIG-I from autorepressed to signaling competent may occur at the stage of RNA binding, ATP binding, or ATP hydrolysis, and this is denoted here with aroows bearing question markes leading from each stage in RNA-stimulated ATPase activity to the immune signaling interaction. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09391. 003 RIG-I requires both RNA and ATP ligands in order to become activated and initiate signaling. The precise molecular determinants for functional RNA recognition by RIG-I have been well characterized through structural, biochemical and cell-based approaches ( Schlee et al., 2009; Luo et al., 2012b; Kohlway et al., 2013; Goubau et al., 2014 ). However, the specific roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis in activating RIG-I for immune signaling have not been defined or differentiated. Mutational studies have underscored the key role of conserved amino acids within the ATPase active-site of RIG-I. For example, residues that are required for ATP hydrolysis, such as the conserved lysine within helicase motif I ( the Walker A motif ), or the conserved glutamate and aspartate residues within motif II, exhibit dramatically reduced signaling capabilities ( Yoneyama et al., 2004; Bamming and Horvath, 2009; Rawling et al., 2015 ). In contrast, RIG-I signaling is not impaired by motif III mutations that significantly perturb ATPase activity ( Bamming and Horvath, 2009 ), thereby making it difficult to establish a direct relationship between hydrolysis and signaling. Alternative roles proposed for ATP hydrolysis include translocation and filament formation ( Myong et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2013; Peisley et al., 2013 ), however these functions have not been shown to be absolutely necessary for signaling by RIG-I ( Kohlway et al., 2013; Louber et al., 2014 ). Thus, the function of ATPase activity in RIG-I signaling remains unclear. To fully understand the determinants for RIG-I signal activation, the roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis must be established. While robust signaling is often associated with ATP hydrolysis activity ( Yoneyama et al., 2004; Bamming and Horvath, 2009; Luo et al., 2011; Kohlway et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2013; Peisley et al., 2013; Rawling et al., 2015 ), the ability of an RNA ligand to stimulate RIG-I ATPase activity does not necessarily ensure immune-stimulatory activity. It has been demonstrated that duplex RNAs containing a 5\u2032 hydroxyl can bind RIG-I and stimulate robust ATP hydrolysis ( Kohlway et al., 2013; Rawling et al., 2015 ), yet these RNAs do not induce immune signaling by RIG-I, even at saturating concentrations ( Schlee et al., 2009; Baum et al., 2010; Goubau et al., 2014 ). Similarly, RIG-I ATPase activity can be stimulated by short RNAs bearing a 3\u2032 overhang, as seen in miRNA precursors ( Schlee et al., 2009; Wilson and Doudna, 2013 ). There are many other cellular RNAs that might be expected to bind RIG-I, such as lncRNAs, which contain abundant stem-loop structures ( Somarowthu et al., 2015 ) and 5\u2032 monophosphorylated products of mRNA decapping ( Coller and Parker, 2004 ). Therefore, a mechanism to discriminate between endogenous and pathogenic RNA must be utilized. The ability to differentiate between host and viral RNA is essential, as aberrant activation of RIG-I would result in unregulated signaling that could lead to auto-inflammation and other innate immune disorders. Thus, elucidating the mechanism for RNA ligand discrimination and understanding its linkage with ATP utilization are central to understanding the induction and regulation of RIG-I signaling. In this work, we use a series of biophysical and cell-based approaches, together with mutational analysis, to distinguish between the roles of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis in RIG-I function. We show that RNA-stimulated ATP binding can activate RIG-I for immune signaling in the absence of hydrolysis, thus explaining the lack of a correlation between ATP hydrolysis and signaling. Using a novel RNA ligand lacking free ends, we establish that ATP-mediated signal activation requires RNA end capping by the CTD. We demonstrate that in the absence of end capping, ATP binding and hydrolysis promote RIG-I dissociation from RNA rather than signaling, thereby contributing to proofreading and rejection of sub-optimal RNA ligands, such as endogenous RNA. Additionally, we show that ATP-stimulated RNA dissociation is dependent on the CARD domains of RIG-I. We therefore propose a model in which ATP binding by RIG-I leads to conformational changes that can result in either the liberation of the CARDs for signaling or RIG-I dissociation from RNA, depending on the affinity of RIG-I for the bound RNA ligand. ATP binding and hydrolysis thus play important roles in RIG-I function by activating signaling and ensuring RNA target specificity.

Some viruses, such as those that cause influenza or measles, store their genetic information in the form of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) molecules. When a virus is first detected inside an animal, specialized cells are activated and sent to destroy the invader. This is known as the innate immune response. Animal cells contain a sensor known as RIG-I, and when RIG-I detects and binds to viral RNA, it starts a signaling process that activates the innate immune system. RIG-I can also bind to RNA molecules made by the host cell, but this binding does not cause RIG-I to activate the immune response. Although there have been many studies into how RIG-I tells the difference between cell and virus RNA ( this process is also known as \u2018proofreading\u2019 ), many of these have overlooked the role of a molecule called ATP. ATP stores energy for the cell, which is released in a process called hydrolysis. Binding to RNA causes the shape of RIG-I to change so that it can also bind to ATP, and RIG-I cannot signal to trigger an immune response unless it is bound to ATP. Now, Rawling, Fitzgerald and Pyle have investigated ATP's role in immune signaling in more detail, and have found that ATP plays two distinct roles. Binding to ATP is necessary for RIG-I to start signaling in response to viral RNA, as it activates or \u2018springs open\u2019 the signaling regions formed when RIG-I binds to RNA. ATP hydrolysis is not involved in signaling; instead, it helps to remove RIG-I from the cell's RNA molecules. This recycles RIG-I and prevents it from becoming activated at the wrong time. With a clear mechanistic description of RIG-I proofreading in place, it will now be possible to investigate how certain viruses take advantage of this system to evade detection. Further investigations could also look at how the dysregulation of RIG-I proofreading may be related to autoimmune disorders and cancer ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nUnderstanding how option values are compared when making a choice is a key objective for decision neuroscience. In natural situations, agents may have a priori on their preferences that create default policies and shape the neural comparison process. We asked participants to make choices between items belonging to different categories ( e. g., jazz vs. rock music ). Behavioral data confirmed that the items taken from the preferred category were chosen more often and more rapidly, which qualified them as default options. FMRI data showed that baseline activity in classical brain valuation regions, such as the ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex ( vmPFC ), reflected the strength of prior preferences. In addition, evoked activity in the same regions scaled with the default option value, irrespective of the eventual choice. We therefore suggest that in the brain valuation system, choices are framed as comparisons between default and alternative options, which might save some resource but induce a decision bias.  Standard decision theory assumes that when faced with a choice, individuals first assign subjective values to each option, and then compare these values in order to select the best option ( Samuelson, 1938; Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1947 ). Understanding the neural mechanisms governing this valuation/selection process has become a central aim in the field of decision neuroscience. A large set of fMRI evidence points to the ventro-medial Prefrontal Cortex ( vmPFC ) as a key player in the valuation process ( Bartra et al., 2013; Clithero and Rangel, 2014 ). Neural activity in the vmPFC reflects subjective values, either measured with likeability ratings or inferred from binary choices ( Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Rangel and Hare, 2010 ). In accordance with the idea of a common neural currency ( Levy and Glimcher, 2012 ), the vmPFC was found to encode the subjective value of many kinds of goods, such as food, money, trinkets, faces, paintings, charities, etc. ( Chib et al., 2009; Hare et al., 2010; Lebreton et al., 2009; Plassmann et al., 2007 ). Such value coding was observed not only during choice but also in the absence of choice, during passive viewing of items presented in the attentional focus or when performing a distractive task on these items ( Lebreton et al., 2009; Levy et al., 2011; Abitbol et al., 2015 ). During binary choices, it has been repeatedly shown that vmPFC activity correlates with the relative value of the two options under consideration ( VA\u2013VB ). However, the framing of such decision value signal, i. e. what A and B actually represent, remains an unresolved issue. This question is of importance because the brain regions downstream in the decision process cannot operate the appropriate selection without knowing which option is favored by the relative value signal. In particular, the post-decisional frame that has often been reported ( Boorman et al., 2013; Hare et al., 2011; Hunt et al., 2012 ) provides a decision value signal between chosen and unchosen options ( Vch-Vunch ) that cannot be used for making the selection. A spatial frame, based on the location of options ( e. g., Vleft-Vright ), has been suggested but not supported by much experimental evidence regarding the vmPFC valuation signal ( Palminteri et al., 2009; Wunderlich et al., 2009; Skvortsova et al., 2014 ). A more promising suggestion is the attentional frame ( Krajbich et al., 2010 ), in which the decision value signal encoded in the vmPFC depends on which option is attended to ( Vatt-Vunatt ). Such framing provided a good account for vmPFC activity in a choice task where fixation patterns were imposed to subjects, and correctly predicted several features of spontaneous choice behavior by imposing a discount weight on the unattended option value ( Krajbich et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2011 ). Notably, the attentional frame predicts that more fixated options should be more frequently chosen, which might explain why vmPFC activity has been found to correlate with Vch-Vunch in other studies. However, the attentional model assumes that visual exploration is random, which might be true in artificial laboratory tasks where subjects have no information about upcoming options, but not in natural situations where prior knowledge might play a role. Here, we hypothesize that the framing of the decision value encoded in the vmPFC is imposed by prior preferences. In other words, vmPFC activity should scale positively with the value of the option that is preferred a priori, which we call the default option, and negatively with that of the alternative ( Vdef-Valt ). This hypothesis is compatible with the observation that vmPFC activity correlates with Vch-Vunch, since choices usually follows on prior preferences. Yet, the interpretation is fundamentally different, as Vdef-Valt is a pre-decisional value signal susceptible to drive option selection. Our hypothesis builds on the literature about optimal foraging, which argues that stay/switch choice is the natural case of decision-making ( Stephens and Krebs, 1986 ). In this framework, staying on a same patch is the default option against which all alternatives must be compared. Several studies investigated such stay/switch decisions and implicated the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in promoting a shift away from the default option ( Hayden et al., 2011; Kolling et al., 2012; Kvitsiani et al., 2013 ), while others induced default policies by manipulating prior probabilities of being correct ( Boorman et al., 2013; Fleming et al., 2010; Mulder et al., 2012; Scheibe et al., 2010 ). Although experimental manipulations vary across these studies, the default option is always defined as the option that would be selected in the absence of further information processing about its value relative to the alternatives. This definition provides objective criteria to identify the default option in a choice set: it should be selected faster and more frequently than the alternatives. Therefore, our hypothesis implies that prior preferences should ( 1 ) induce a bias in favor of the default option, and ( 2 ) determine the frame of the value comparison process. The purpose of the present study was to examine how these two constraints would shape the brain valuation signal. To do so, we exploited the hierarchical structure of preferences: individuals have global preferences between categories of goods that can be locally reversed when comparing particular items. For instance, someone may prefer pop to jazz music in general, but nonetheless pick Keith Jarrett if the only other option is Britney Spears. In a binary choice, the prior preference at the category level thus designates a default option ( i. e., the item belonging to the preferred category ), but the option values still need to be compared at the item level in order to reach a final decision. We conducted an fMRI experiment where participants made binary choices between items belonging to different categories. Preferences between categories were inferred from likeability ratings that were collected for every item before the scanning session. In the following analyses, we first establish the presence of a bias toward the default option in both choice and response time, above and beyond the prior preference between categories. Using computational modeling, we provide evidence that the default bias is best accounted for by a shift in the starting point of a drift diffusion process, which is proportional to the prior preference between categories. Then, we show that the default bias is unrelated to gaze fixation pattern, precluding an attentional framing. Finally, we uncover two effects of prior preference in fMRI data: ( 1 ) vmPFC baseline activity reflects the a priori shift in favor of the default option, and ( 2 ) vmPFC evoked response represents the value of the default option, irrespective of the eventual choice.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: If you had the choice of listening to a piece of music by either the singer C\u00e9line Dion or jazz pianist Keith Jarrett, which would you pick ? When choosing between two mutually exclusive options, the brain first assigns a value to each. An area called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) compares these two values and calculates the difference between them. The vmPFC then relays this difference to other brain regions that trigger the movements required to obtain the selected option. But what exactly is the vmPFC comparing ? A reasonable assumption is that we approach the decision with an existing preference for one of the options based on our previous experience. Lopez-Persem et al. set out to determine whether and how the vmPFC uses this existing preference \u2013 for example, for pop music over jazz \u2013 to drive the decision-making process. For the experiments, volunteers were asked to rate how much they liked individual musicians spanning a range of different genres. While lying inside a brain scanner, the subjects then had to choose their favorite from pairs of musicians selected from the list. When making such decisions, volunteers must consider both the overall category ( do I prefer jazz or pop ? ) but also the individual examples ( a pop music fan might choose jazz if the pop option is Britney Spears ). Lopez-Persem et al. found that the volunteer\u2019s decisions were biased towards their prior preference. Pop music fans chose C\u00e9line Dion or Britney Spears more often than would be expected based on the likability ratings they had given the individual artists in the study. Brain imaging revealed that the vmPFC represents choices as \u2018default minus alternative\u2019, where the default is any member of the previously preferred category ( e. g. any pop artist for a pop music fan ) and the alternative is from a different category ( e. g. a jazz artist ). Baseline vmPFC activity is higher for members of the preferred category, giving these options a head start over the alternatives. Asking volunteers to choose between other types of objects, including food and magazines, produced similar results. The brain thus uses a general strategy for decision-making that saves time and effort, but which also introduces bias. The next step is to work out how downstream brain regions use the vmPFC signal to select the preferred option ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nDisentangling the effect on genomic diversity of natural selection from that of demography is notoriously difficult, but necessary to properly reconstruct the history of species. Here, we use high-quality human genomic data to show that purifying selection at linked sites ( i. e. background selection, BGS ) and GC-biased gene conversion ( gBGC ) together affect as much as 95% of the variants of our genome. We find that the magnitude and relative importance of BGS and gBGC are largely determined by variation in recombination rate and base composition. Importantly, synonymous sites and non-transcribed regions are also affected, albeit to different degrees. Their use for demographic inference can lead to strong biases. However, by conditioning on genomic regions with recombination rates above 1. 5 cM/Mb and mutation types ( C\u2194G, A\u2194T ), we identify a set of SNPs that is mostly unaffected by BGS or gBGC, and that avoids these biases in the reconstruction of human history.  Human genomic diversity has evolved under diverse and complex constraints ( Auton et al., 2015 ), such as past demography, selection, mutations, or genomic rearrangements ( Lohmueller et al., 2011; Schiffels and Durbin, 2014; Sudmant et al., 2015; Mallick et al., 2016 ). However, the influence of these evolutionary forces and their interactions remain to be fully understood. For instance, it is yet unclear which fraction of the genome evolves under positive or purifying selection ( McVicker et al., 2009; Rands et al., 2014; Corbett-Detig et al., 2015 ). Such information is crucial to our understanding of what portion of the genome is evolving neutrally, and necessary to form a clear basis for demographic inference, the detection of selective events, or the inference of the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations. Genome-wide variation in recombination may strongly affect neutral variants ( Spencer et al., 2006; Corbett-Detig et al., 2015 ), as selection will have more impact on linked polymorphism in regions of low recombination ( Charlesworth et al., 1995 ), whereas biased gene conversion, which can also mimic the effect of selection ( Galtier and Duret, 2007; Ratnakumar et al., 2010 ), will occur mostly in regions of high recombination ( Katzman et al., 2011 ). In humans, various measures of diversity are positively correlated with levels of recombination ( Nachman, 2001; Spencer et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2009; Lohmueller et al., 2011 ). While a direct mutagenic effect of recombination seems unlikely ( McVicker et al., 2009; Schaibley et al., 2013 ) except at CpG sites ( Arbeithuber et al., 2015 ), there is still some debate about whether the correlation between diversity and recombination is driven by recurrent selective sweeps ( hitchhiking of neutral and slightly deleterious mutations ) or background selection ( BGS; i. e. purifying selection against deleterious mutations at linked sites ) ( McVicker et al., 2009; Stephan, 2010; Hernandez et al., 2011; Lohmueller et al., 2011 ). The modeling of genomic diversity under selection in humans suggests that it can be explained entirely by BGS ( Lohmueller et al., 2011 ), whereas a combination of both BGS and positive selection seems to best explain genomic diversity in Drosophila ( Elyashiv et al., 2016 ). However, the correlation between diversity and recombination is generally relatively weak in humans for most tested statistics and seems restricted to genomic regions of relatively low-recombination rate ( <1 cM/Mb, ( Cai et al., 2009; Lohmueller et al., 2011 ) ). Given the positive relationship between recombination and genetic variability, it has been proposed that the genomic regions most suitable for demographic inferences should be far away from genes and have high-recombination rates ( Lohmueller et al., 2011 ). However, regions of high recombination might be prone to GC-biased gene conversion ( gBGC ), a process by which GC alleles in recombination tracts are preferentially transmitted in GC/AT heterozygotes ( Duret and Galtier, 2009 ). This process thus increases the frequency of G and C derived alleles ( usually denoted as strong or S alleles, Lachance and Tishkoff, 2014 ) relative to A and T ( denoted as weak or W alleles ), especially in recombination hotspots ( Spencer et al., 2006; Gl\u00e9min et al., 2015 ). By modifying allele frequencies in high-recombination regions, gBGC affects the site frequency spectrum ( SFS ) ( Lachance and Tishkoff, 2014; Gl\u00e9min et al., 2015 ) such that it becomes right-shifted for W-to-S ( WS ) mutations and left-shifted for S-to-W ( SW ) mutations. In addition, gBGC affects various classical statistics used to detect selection, and WS SNPs show larger levels of population differentiation than other SNPs ( Lachance and Tishkoff, 2014 ). Overall, gBGC is believed to directly affect only 1% to 2% of the human genome, near recombination hotspots ( Gl\u00e9min et al., 2015 ), but due to the transient nature of these hotspots, a larger fraction of the genome could have been affected in the long term. Here, we use two whole-genome human datasets to determine how and to what extent recombination and selective forces affect genome-wide diversity in humans. We examine the relationship between recombination rate and the average derived allele frequency per individual, as well as the SFS. After determining the parts of the genome that are least affected by BGS and gBGC, we examine the impact of these two processes on the SFS, and how they affect demographic inference based on the SFS.

However, only about 10 percent of the human genome is made up of genes that code for proteins, or have a defined role in the body. The DNA sequence is largely the same in all people, but some modifications \u2013 or variants \u2013 occur about every hundred letters. These produce different versions of the same gene, which give us our unique features, such as the color of our hair or eyes. The frequencies of some genetic variants can change over time, which makes human populations diverge genetically and physically. This can happen through different mechanisms. Positive selection keeps variants that are beneficial in specific environments, while negative selection removes genetic changes that are detrimental, for example because they cause disease. Transmission bias favors one of the two variants from our two parents. Chance alters the frequencies of neutral variants, which are neither good nor bad for the individual. It is important to distinguish between these different scenarios, as they inform us about the forces that act on human evolution. For example, neutral variants tell us about the demography and migration patterns between populations. Variants under negative selection reveal which genetic areas are under pressure to stay the same because they are important for the organism to function correctly. Until now, it was unclear how we could best identify the variants affected by different evolutionary pressures, and how much of the genome was under negative selection. Pouyet, Aeschbacher et al. created a measure of genetic diversity that is only affected by selection or transmission bias. The results showed that negative selection influences as much as 85 percent of our genome, whereas transmission bias affects a majority of the rest of the genome. After removing these two biases, less than 5 percent of the human genome is found to evolve by chance. This suggests that while most of our genetic material is formed of non-functional sequences, the vast majority of it evolves indirectly under some type of selection. These findings define which parts of our genome evolves neutrally and can therefore be used to correctly reconstruct the past demography and migration events of humans around the world. The next step could be to reassess the history of human populations that was drawn using genomic data ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nCommand-like descending neurons can induce many behaviors, such as backward locomotion, escape, feeding, courtship, egg-laying, or grooming ( we define \u2018command-like neuron\u2019 as a neuron whose activation elicits or \u2018commands\u2019 a specific behavior ). In most animals, it remains unknown how neural circuits switch between antagonistic behaviors: via top-down activation/inhibition of antagonistic circuits or via reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic circuits. Here, we use genetic screens, intersectional genetics, circuit reconstruction by electron microscopy, and functional optogenetics to identify a bilateral pair of Drosophila larval \u2018mooncrawler descending neurons\u2019 ( MDNs ) with command-like ability to coordinately induce backward locomotion and block forward locomotion; the former by stimulating a backward-active premotor neuron, and the latter by disynaptic inhibition of a forward-specific premotor neuron. In contrast, direct monosynaptic reciprocal inhibition between forward and backward circuits was not observed. Thus, MDNs coordinate a transition between antagonistic larval locomotor behaviors. Interestingly, larval MDNs persist into adulthood, where they can trigger backward walking. Thus, MDNs induce backward locomotion in both limbless and limbed animals.  Animals typically execute one behavior to the exclusion of all other possible behaviors ( Briggman and Kristan, 2008 ). For example, leeches can either crawl or swim, but cannot do both simultaneously ( Briggman and Kristan, 2006; Kristan, 2008 ) ; or using the same set of muscles, a locust is capable of either walking or flying but cannot execute both behaviors at the same time ( Ramirez and Pearson, 1988 ). Such mutually exclusive choice of behavior has also been observed in several other systems, including Caenorhabditis elegans ( forward vs backward crawling ), Tritonia ( crawling vs swimming ), leech ( feeding vs swimming ), tadpole ( struggling vs swimming ), turtle ( swimming vs scratching ), and zebrafish ( left vs right escape ) ( Berkowitz, 2002; Gaudry and Kristan, 2010; Koyama et al., 2016; Popescu and Frost, 2002; Roberts et al., 2016; Soffe, 1993 ). The selection of a locomotor program to the exclusion of all others is necessary to prevent injury and escape predation. Despite the paramount importance of rapid transitions between antagonistic motor programs, the underlying circuitry is only beginning to be understood in C. elegans ( Lindsay et al., 2011; Piggott et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2016 ). Command-like neurons can elicit specific behaviors, such as forward locomotion, backward locomotion, pausing, escape, flight, grooming, feeding, courtship, egg-laying or sleep ( Bidaye et al., 2014; Bouvier et al., 2015; H\u00e4gglund et al., 2010; Hampel et al., 2015; Hedwig, 2000; H\u00fcckesfeld et al., 2015; Kallman et al., 2015; Liu and Fetcho, 1999; Ohyama et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 1985; Sen et al., 2017; Tanouye and Wyman, 1980; von Philipsborn et al., 2011; Weber et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015 ). However, much less is known about how antagonistic motor programs are suppressed during command neuron-induced behavior. On one hand, there could be a high degree of reciprocal inhibition between neurons in antagonistic circuits; on the other hand, the command neurons that activate one behavior may also suppress antagonistic behaviors ( in which case there could be minimal reciprocal inhibition ). Here, we use the Drosophila larva to characterize the neural circuits coordinately regulating two antagonistic behaviors: forward versus backward locomotion. Drosophila larva have many distinct behaviors ( Vogelstein et al., 2014 ), but forward locomotion is the default locomotor behavior ( Berni et al., 2012 ) and consists of coordinated posterior-to-anterior waves of somatic body wall muscle contractions driven by corresponding waves of motor neuron activity within the segmented ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) ( Clark et al., 2018; Heckscher et al., 2012; Hughes and Thomas, 2007; Pulver et al., 2015 ). There are\u00a0~35 motor neurons per bilateral hemisegment, innervating 30 body wall muscles ( Landgraf and Thor, 2006 ), about 250 interneurons per hemisegment ( Rickert et al., 2011 ), and an unknown number of ascending and descending neurons traversing each segment of the VNC. The circuits for motor wave propagation ( Fushiki et al., 2016 ), the coordination of muscle groups within each segment ( Zwart et al., 2016 ), and the bilateral adjustment of muscle contraction amplitude ( Heckscher et al., 2015 ) have been recently investigated; however, much less is known about the circuits promoting backward locomotion, or the switching from forward to backward locomotion. Larvae initiate backward locomotion upon encountering a barrier or experiencing mild noxious stimulation to the anterior body ( Kernan et al., 1994; Robertson et al., 2013; Takagi et al., 2017; Titlow et al., 2014; Tracey et al., 2003 ). Backward locomotion consists of anterior-to-posterior waves of motor neuron and muscle activity ( Heckscher et al., 2012; Pulver et al., 2015 ). A segmentally\u00a0reiterated VNC neuron that triggers backward locomotion has been identified ( Takagi et al., 2017 ), but high-order command-like neurons for backward locomotion and the circuit for executing backward wave propagation while simultaneously suppressing forward waves remain unknown. Here, we identify a bilateral pair of Drosophila brain descending neurons that coordinately activate backward locomotion and suppress forward locomotion, and identify the downstream pre-motor circuitry effecting the switch. Surprisingly, immortalization of CsChrimson ( Chrimson ) expression in these larval command-like neurons reveals that they survive metamorphosis, have the exact morphology of previously described adult \u2018moonwalker\u2019 neurons ( Bidaye et al., 2014 ), and can induce backward walking in the adult. By analogy to the adult naming scheme, we refer to these larval brain neurons as \u2018mooncrawler descending neurons\u2019 ( MDNs ). We reconstruct the larval MDNs in an electron microscopy volume comprising the whole central nervous system ( Ohyama et al., 2015 ), in which we also map its postsynaptic neuron partners. We identify the circuit motifs by which MDNs induce backward locomotion while simultaneously suppressing forward locomotion. The MDNs project their axons along the length of the nerve cord, where they directly activate an excitatory cholinergic pre-motor neuron ( A18b ) that is specifically active during backward waves. In parallel, the MDNs synapse onto a GABAergic inhibitory neuron ( Pair1 ) that directly inhibits cholinergic pre-motor neurons ( A27h ) active specifically during forward locomotion ( Fushiki et al., 2016 ) ; optogenetic experiments showed that MDNs activate Pair1 neurons, which then inhibit A27h and block forward locomotion. The circuit structure therefore suggests that two behaviors such as forward and backward peristaltic locomotion can maintain mutually exclusive activity due to top-down excitation/inhibition, rather than reciprocal inhibition. We conclude that the MDNs promote backward locomotion at all stages of the Drosophila life cycle: from the limbless crawling maggot to the limbed walking adult.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: When we choose to make one kind of movement, it often prevents us making another. We cannot move forward and backward at the same time, for example, and a horse cannot simultaneously gallop and walk. These \u2018antagonistic\u2019 behaviors often use the same group of muscles, but the muscles contract in a different order. This requires exquisite control over muscle contractions. Neurons located in the central nervous system form circuits to produce distinct patterns of muscle contractions and to switch between these patterns. Smooth, rapid switching between behaviors is important for animal escape and survival, as well as for performing fine movements. However, we know little about how the activity of the neuronal circuits enables this. Carreira-Rosario, Zarin, Clark et al. set out to identify the underlying neuronal circuitry that allows larval fruit flies to transition between crawling forward and backward. Results from a combination of genetics and microscopy techniques revealed that a neuron called the Mooncrawler Descending Neuron ( MDN ) induces a switch from forward to backward travel. MDN activates a neuron that stops the larvae crawling forward, and at the same time activates a different neuron that is only active when the larvae crawl backward. Carreira-Rosario et al. also found that MDN triggers backward crawling in the six-limbed adult fly. Understanding how a single neuron \u2013 in this case MDN \u2013 can trigger a smooth switch between opposing behaviors could be beneficial for the medical and robotics fields. In the medical field, understanding how movement is generated could help to improve therapies that fix damage to the relevant neuronal circuits. Understanding how behavioral transitions occur may also help to design autonomous robots that can navigate complex terrain ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMalaria has been a major driving force in the evolution of the human genome. In sub-Saharan African populations, two neighbouring polymorphisms in the Complement Receptor One ( CR1 ) gene, named Sl2 and McCb, occur at high frequencies, consistent with selection by malaria. Previous studies have been inconclusive. Using a large case-control study of severe malaria in Kenyan children and statistical models adjusted for confounders, we estimate the relationship between Sl2 and McCb and malaria phenotypes, and find they have opposing associations. The Sl2 polymorphism is associated with markedly reduced odds of cerebral malaria and death, while the McCb polymorphism is associated with increased odds of cerebral malaria. We also identify an apparent interaction between Sl2 and \u03b1+thalassaemia, with the protective association of Sl2 greatest in children with normal \u03b1-globin. The complex relationship between these three mutations may explain previous conflicting findings, highlighting the importance of considering genetic interactions in disease-association studies.  Complement Receptor One ( CR1 ) plays a key role in the control of complement activation and the immune clearance of C3b/C4b-coated immune complexes ( Krych-Goldberg and Atkinson, 2001 ). CR1 is expressed on a range of cells including red blood cells ( RBCs ), leucocytes and glomerular podocytes ( Krych-Goldberg and Atkinson, 2001 ). A number of CR1 polymorphisms have been described, including four molecular weight variants and variation in the number of CR1 molecules expressed on the surface of RBCs ( reviewed by [Krych-Goldberg et al., 2002; Schmidt et al., 2015] ). Missense mutations of CR1 form the basis of the Knops blood group system of antigens, that includes the antithetical antigen pairs of Swain-Langley 1 and 2 ( Sl1 and Sl2 ) and McCoy a and b ( McCa and McCb ) ( Moulds, 2010 ). The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) A4828G ( rs17047661 ) and A4795G ( rs17047660 ) within exon 29 of the CR1 gene give rise to the Sl1/Sl2 and McCa/McCb alleles, encoding R1601G and K1590E, respectively ( Moulds et al., 2001 ) ( Figure 1 ). CR1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, with epidemiological and in vitro data suggesting a role in malaria ( Schmidt et al., 2015 ). The Sl2 and McCb alleles occur at high frequencies only in populations of African origin ( Figure 2 ) ( Thathy et al., 2005; Zimmerman et al., 2003; Moulds et al., 2004; Noumsi et al., 2011; Fitness et al., 2004; Covas et al., 2007; Gandhi et al., 2009; Yoon et al., 2013; Hansson et al., 2013; Kariuki et al., 2013; Eid et al., 2010 ), which, given the historical prevalence of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum in sub-Saharan Africa, might suggest a possible survival advantage against malaria ( Rowe et al., 1997; Rowe et al., 2000 ). CR1 is a receptor for the invasion of RBCs by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites ( Spadafora et al., 2010; Tham et al., 2010 ) and for the formation of clusters of P. falciparum-infected RBCs ( iRBCs ) and uninfected RBCs, known as rosettes ( Rowe et al., 1997 ). The rosetting phenotype is associated with severe malaria in sub-Saharan Africa ( Doumbo et al., 2009 ), with pathological effects likely due to the obstruction of microcirculatory blood flow ( Kaul et al., 1991 ). RBCs from donors with the high-frequency African CR1 Knops mutations bind poorly to the parasite ligand P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 ( PfEMP1 ) that mediates rosetting by iRBCs, potentially protecting against severe malaria by reducing rosetting ( Rowe et al., 1997 ). Nevertheless, epidemiological data supporting this possibility are contradictory, with some studies showing an association between Sl and McC genotypes and severe malaria ( Thathy et al., 2005; Kariuki et al., 2013; Tettey et al., 2015 ) and others finding none ( Zimmerman et al., 2003; Hansson et al., 2013; Jallow et al., 2009; Manjurano et al., 2012; Toure et al., 2012; Rockett et al., 2014 ). Some previous studies have not considered Sl and McC genotypes together in the same statistical model, despite their physical adjacency in the CR1 molecule, nor taken into account potential interactions with other malaria resistance genes. Given the important biological role of CR1 in malaria host-parasite interactions, we aimed to clarify the relationship between the Sl and McC alleles and severe malaria in a case-control study of Kenyan children. These investigations were supplemented with a separate longitudinal cohort study of Kenyan children, examining the associations of these alleles with uncomplicated malaria and other common childhood illnesses. Finally, we also investigated the influence of these alleles on the formation of P. falciparum rosettes, as a potential functional explanation for these results through ex vivo laboratory studies.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Malaria kills more than half a million children in Africa every year. The disease is caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, and mosquitos infected with the parasites spread them to humans when they bite. Once inside a human, the parasites infect the red blood cells. In severe cases, these red blood cells can stick to the walls of small blood vessels that supply the brain and so hinder the flow of oxygen, causing a coma. This is called cerebral malaria. Malaria can also result in the destruction of many oxygen-carrying red blood cells, which causes severe anemia. Both cerebral malaria and severe anemia can lead to death. Small changes ( called mutations ) in certain human genes can protect against malaria. Over time, mutations that protect people living in Africa from dying from malaria have been passed down through generations. A good example is the sickle cell mutation, which causes red blood cells to be of an unusual shape, but also affects the ability of malaria parasites to grow normally within red cells. Finding new mutations that protect against malaria may help scientists understand how severe malaria happens and eventually develop new drugs and vaccines against the disease. Some studies have found that mutations in a gene called complement receptor 1 ( CR1 ) may be protective, although others have disagreed. Now, Opi, Swann et al. show that children with one of the CR1 mutations were one-third less likely to get cerebral malaria and half as likely to die as children without the mutation. In the study, genetic and health information on more than 5, 500 children in Kenya were analyzed to see if the severity of malaria differed depending on whether they had a CR1 mutation. They also found that the CR1 mutation is only protective against severe malaria when the child does not have another malaria- protective mutation called \u03b1-thalassemia. In children with \u03b1-thalassemia, the CR1 mutation does not make a difference. The interaction between the CR1 mutation and \u03b1-thalassemia may explain why some studies did not show a benefit of CR1. If the researchers did not include \u03b1-thalassemia in their assessment, they could not have seen the whole picture. Future studies showing how the CR1 mutation protects against cerebral malaria could help identify new treatments that prevent severe disease or death. More study of interactions between genes that play a role in malaria may also be helpful ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nBacterial biofilms can generate micro-heterogeneity in terms of surface structures. However, little is known about the associated changes in the physics of cell\u2013cell interaction and its impact on the architecture of biofilms. In this study, we used the type IV pilus of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to test whether variation of surface structures induces cell-sorting. We show that the rupture forces between pili are fine-tuned by post-translational modification. Bacterial sorting was dependent on pilus post-translational modification and pilus density. Active force generation was necessary for defined morphologies of mixed microcolonies. The observed morphotypes were in remarkable agreement with the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis proposing that a tug-of-war among surface structures of different cells governs cell sorting. We conclude that in early biofilms the density and rupture force of bacterial surface structures can trigger cell sorting based on similar physical principles as in developing embryos.  Physical interactions and in particular mechanical forces are involved in sorting of different cell types. These requirements have been established in the field of embryonic development ( Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 2012 ). Cells must divide, change shape, adhere to each other, migrate, disperse, or cluster. To complete these processes, they modulate their physical properties including rigidity, position, motility, and strength of adhesion ( Fagotto, 2014 ). The development of bacterial biofilms resembles eukaryotic development in various aspects including genetic programs that are controlled by master regulators ( Monds and O'Toole, 2009 ). However, it is unclear to which extent physical forces are involved in determining the architecture of biofilms. An early approach for understanding cell sorting on the basis of physical interactions was the differential adhesion hypothesis ( Steinberg, 1963 ). This hypothesis states that a population of cells will sort into spatially separated subpopulations, if the strength of cell\u2013cell adhesion differs between cell types. The biophysical explanation for this sorting is the tendency of cell clusters to minimize their surface, similar to the minimization of surface tension in liquids. Depending on the strength of cohesion between cells of the same kind and the strength of adhesion between different kinds of cells, the model predicts perfect mixing, encasement, partial segregation, and full segregation of cells ( Steinberg, 1963; Graner and Glazier, 1992 ). Some of these morphotypes have been observed experimentally ( Steinberg and Takeichi, 1994; Foty and Steinberg, 2004 ). Recent experiments indicate that equilibrium descriptions are not sufficient for describing the process of cell sorting during development; they provide evidence that active force generation by cells is involved ( Landsberg et al., 2009; Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 2012; Kashef and Franz, 2015; Mao and Baum, 2015 ). In particular, the differential interfacial tension hypothesis introduces cortical contractility in addition to adhesion ( Brodland and Chen, 2000 ). Interestingly, Harris proposed another hypothesis, the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis ( DSAH ) ( Harris, 1976 ). He envisions a tug-of-war of cells actively moving along each other by retractions of cellular extensions pulling the cell body into the direction of the strongest and least breakable bonds. Cells with lower bond strength would be squeezed outward to the peripheral layer. Sorting of cells also occurs during bacterial biofilm development. Cell\u2013cell interactions and biofilm architecture are often governed by cell appendages with polymeric organization. One of the most ubiquitous appendages is the type IV pilus ( T4P ) ( Berry and Pelicic, 2015 ). It mediates surface attachment, surface motility, and its retraction can generate high mechanical force ( Maier and Wong, 2015; Maier, 2013 ). The T4P is a helical polymer consisting mainly of the major subunit PilE ( Craig et al., 2004 ). The major subunit can be post-translationally modified by O-linked glycosylation or by phosphoform-modifications. Cell sorting based on T4P has been observed in different experimental setups. Vibrio cholerae can express a T4P-like system and generate toxin co-regulated pili. Cells lacking the major pilin of the toxin co-regulated pilus did not integrate into wt microcolonies ( Kirn et al., 2000 ). Mutations in the major pilin subunits induced different pilus morphology and affected the size of pilus bundles. However, cell sorting based on these mutations was not reported ( Kirn et al., 2000 ). Differential fluorescence labeling of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that cells with T4P-dependent motility form a cap on top of non-motile stalks formed by cells that lacked the gene for the major pilin subunit ( Klausen et al., 2003 ). Swarming of P. aeruginosa is generated by a single flagellum, but moderated by polar T4P ( Anyan et al., 2014 ). When T4P production was suppressed, swarming motility increased considerably, most likely due to reduced cellular clustering mediated by pili. When piliated and non-piliated cells were co-cultured, non-piliated cells dominated the swarm edge. Neisseria meningitidis upregulates expression of a phosphotransferase that is required for phospho-form modification of the major pilin upon attachment to endothelial host cells ( Chamot-Rooke et al., 2011 ). Simulations of pilus bundling suggest post-translational modifications affecting the physical interactions between T4P ( Chamot-Rooke et al., 2011 ). All of these studies imply that T4P can generate a rich diversity of sorting phenomena. However, in contrast to embryonic development, the biophysical basis underlying cell sorting in bacterial biofilms remains elusive. Here, we test the hypothesis that the physical interactions between bacteria govern the morphology of mixed bacterial cell clusters. The T4P of Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( gonococcus ) was used as a model system for systematic variation of cell\u2013cell interactions. We genetically engineered strains with different densities of pili and their abilities to generate force. Moreover, the breakage-force between pili of different cells could be fine-tuned by replacing a gene responsible for pilin post-translational modification. We found that on agar plates, where the dynamics are mostly determined by steric interactions caused by cell division, cells with the lowest pilus density and cells with the lowest pilus-breakage force sorted towards the colony boundary. Sorting was prominent at the front of expanding colonies but within the bulk of the colony sorting was incomplete. In liquid environment where cells actively move by pilus retractions, sorting correlating with pilus density and pilus-breakage force was nearly complete and the resulting morphotypes followed the DSAH. Active pilus retraction was essential for cell sorting, suggesting that the cells sort by a tug-of-war between cells.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Communities of bacterial cells can live together embedded within a slime-like molecular matrix as a biofilm. This allows the bacteria to hide from external stresses. A single bacterium can replicate itself and develop into a biofilm, and over time the bacterial cells in specific regions of the biofilm will start to interact with their neighbors in different ways. These interactions occur via structures on the surface of the bacterial cells, and the differences in these interactions resemble those that occur as cells specialize during the development of animal embryos. Previous research into embryonic development has shown how differences in the physical interactions between embryonic cells are essential for sorting the cells into their correct locations and shaping the embryo. However, little is known about which processes govern the development of biofilms. Now, Oldewurtel et al. have asked whether differences in the physical interactions between bacteria trigger cell sorting during the early stages of biofilm development. The experiments involved measuring the force required to break the cell\u2013cell connections ( called the \u2018rupture force\u2019 ) in biofilms of a bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Oldewurtel et al. found that, in agreement with previous predictions, physical interactions were important for sorting bacterial cells into clusters based on the structures on their surfaces. Bacterial cells actively pull on the surface structures of their neighbors, which allows the cells to sort themselves in a tug-of-war fashion. This means that a cell will move in the direction where it can pull the strongest ( i. e., in the direction where the rupture force is highest ). While bacteria and embryos use different molecules to generate these pulling forces, these findings indicate that the basic physical principles are similar in both systems. One of the next challenges will be to evaluate how biofilms might benefit from the structures that develop due to cell sorting ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe fish-hunting marine cone snail Conus geographus uses a specialized venom insulin to induce hypoglycemic shock in its prey. We recently showed that this venom insulin, Con-Ins G1, has unique characteristics relevant to the design of new insulin therapeutics. Here, we show that fish-hunting cone snails provide a rich source of minimized ligands of the vertebrate insulin receptor. Insulins from C. geographus, Conus tulipa and Conus kinoshitai exhibit diverse sequences, yet all bind to and activate the human insulin receptor. Molecular dynamics reveal unique modes of action that are distinct from any other insulins known in nature. When tested in zebrafish and mice, venom insulins significantly lower blood glucose in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes. Our findings suggest that cone snails have evolved diverse strategies to activate the vertebrate insulin receptor and provide unique insight into the design of novel drugs for the treatment of diabetes.  Insulin is a pancreatic hormone that is critical for glucose homeostasis. Secretion of insulin from pancreatic \u03b2-cells triggers the uptake of blood glucose into a variety of tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells. Impairment of insulin secretion and/or insensitivity to the insulin produced can lead to the disease diabetes mellitus. To date, three major types of diabetes have been recognized: Type one diabetes ( T1D ) or autoimmune diabetes, Type two diabetes ( T2D ) and gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ). Daily insulin injections are the only effective treatment for patients with T1D, late-stage T2D and some with GDM ( Mack and Tomich, 2017 ). A major limitation of insulin therapy is its delayed action. The native hormone ( consisting of an A and B chain connected by disulfide bonds ) oligomerizes into a stable hexamer comprising three insulin dimers held together by two central zinc ions ( Adams et al., 1969 ). Following subcutaneous injection, the hexamer has to dissociate into the dimer, then monomer, in order to activate the insulin receptor. Hexamer-to-monomer conversion is a slow process that can lead to a significant delay in glucose control. This limitation has spurred efforts to design insulin analogues with reduced dimerization ( and thus oligomerization ) rates ( Owens, 2002 ). However, despite decades of research the best fast-acting insulin formulations are not truly monomeric and still require 15\u201390 min to effectively lower blood glucose ( Elleri et al., 2011 ) ; this is because the region involved in dimerization of the insulin molecule, the C-terminus of the insulin B chain, is also of critical importance for receptor activation ( Menting et al., 2013 ). Until now, removing this region of the B chain in order to generate a fast-acting analog could not be achieved without a near complete loss of biological activity ( Bao et al., 1997; De Meyts et al., 1978 ). Novel insights for potentially solving this long-standing problem recently came from our discovery of an insulin peptide found in the venom of the fish-hunting cone snail, Conus geographus ( Safavi-Hemami et al., 2015 ). C. geographus belongs to a large genus of predatory marine snails that use their complex venoms for prey capture, defense and competitive interactions ( Olivera, 1997 ). C. geographus insulin ( Con-Ins G1 ) was shown to rapidly induce insulin shock ( dangerously low blood sugar ) in its fish prey ( Safavi-Hemami et al., 2015; Robinson and Safavi-Hemami, 2016 ). Remarkably, Con-Ins G1 lacks the region of the B chain that is critical for both, dimerization and receptor engagement in human insulin ( Safavi-Hemami et al., 2015; Menting et al., 2016 ). Despite this, Con-Ins G1 is a potent agonist of the human insulin receptor ( Menting et al., 2016 ). Structure-function studies provided a rationale for this conundrum: two residues within the B chain of Con-Ins G1 act as surrogates for the missing C-terminus of the B chain of human insulin ( Menting et al., 2016 ). Here, we demonstrate that fish-hunting cone snails have evolved a diverse set of B chain minimized insulins as part of their complex predation strategy. Remarkably, these insulins activate the vertebrate insulin receptor ( in fish, mouse and human ) but residues previously identified to serve as surrogates for the loss of the B region in Con-Ins G1 are variable. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the modus operandi of these unique molecules. Our findings suggest the evolution of diverse molecular mechanisms of insulin receptor activation, providing a set of solutions to potentially solve a long-standing problem of designing truly monomeric, fast-acting insulin analogs for the treatment of diabetes.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Insulin is a hormone critical for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels in humans. When the insulin system becomes faulty, blood sugar levels become too high, which can lead to diabetes. At the moment, the only effective treatment for one of the major types of diabetes are daily insulin injections. However, designing fast-acting insulin drugs has remained a challenge. Insulin molecules form clusters ( so-called hexamers ) that first have to dissolve in the body to activate the insulin receptor, which plays a key role in regulating the blood sugar levels throughout the body. This can take time and can therefore delay the blood-sugar control. In 2015, researchers discovered that the fish-hunting cone snail Conus geographus uses a specific type of insulin to capture its prey \u2013 fish. The cone snail releases insulin into the surrounding water and then engulfs its victim with its mouth. This induces dangerously low blood sugar levels in the fish and so makes them an easy target. Unlike the human version, the snail insulin does not cluster, and despite structural differences, can bind to the human insulin receptor. Now, Ahorukomeye, Disotuar et al. \u2013 including some of the authors involved in the previous study \u2013 wanted to find out whether other fish-hunting cone snails also make insulins and if they differed from the one previously discovered in C. geographus. The insulin molecules were extracted and analyzed, and the results showed that the three cone snail species had different versions of insulin \u2013 but none of them formed clusters. Ahorukomeye, Disotuar et al. further revealed that the snail insulins could bind to the human insulin receptors and could also reverse high blood sugar levels in fish and mouse models of the disease. This research may help guide future studies looking into developing fast-acting insulin drugs for diabetic patients. A next step will be to fully understand how snail insulins can be active at the human receptor without forming clusters. Cone snails solved this problem millions of years ago and by understanding how they have done this, researchers are hoping to redesign current diabetic therapeutics. Since the snail insulins do not form clusters and should act faster than currently available insulin drugs, they may lead to better or new diabetes treatments ."}

However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems, particularly in cell shape control, remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that introduction of the MyTH4-FERM tandem into KCBP ( kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein ) during evolution conferred novel functions. The MyTH4 domain and the FERM domain in the N-terminal tail of KCBP physically bind to MTs and F-actin, respectively. During trichome morphogenesis, KCBP distributes in a specific cortical gradient and concentrates at the branching sites and the apexes of elongating branches, which lack MTs but have cortical F-actin. Further, live-cell imaging and genetic analyses revealed that KCBP acts as a hub integrating MTs and actin filaments to assemble the required cytoskeletal configuration for the unique, polarized diffuse growth pattern during trichome cell morphogenesis. Our findings provide significant insights into the mechanisms underlying cytoskeletal regulation of cell shape determination.  Plant cells assume an amazing diversity of cell shapes that enable these cells to execute unique physiological functions, and the study of plant cell shape determination has remained an intriguing part of plant biology ( Smith and Oppenheimer, 2005; Szymanski, 2009 ). The plant cytoskeletal system, composed of microtubules ( MTs ) and actin filaments ( F-actin ), plays a central role in cell morphogenesis in both tip-growing and diffuse-growing cell types. In particular, the cortical MTs play pivotal roles in plant cell growth and directionality, mainly by orienting the deposition of nascent cellulose microfibrils during biosynthesis of the cell wall ( Paradez et al., 2006 ). F-actin plays central roles in polarized cell elongation, mainly by regulating intracellular transport ( Hussey et al., 2006 ). However, despite emerging evidence that cortical MTs and F-actin coordinately regulate plant cell morphogenesis ( Petrasek and Schwarzerova, 2009; Sampathkumar et al., 2011; Sambade et al., 2014 ), the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems remain largely unknown. The Arabidopsis thaliana leaf trichome, a single cell bearing three or four branches on top of a stalk, has long been a model system for investigating the role of the cytoskeleton in defining plant cell shape ( Smith, 2003; Szymanski, 2009 ). The trichome phenotype indicates the cytoskeletal homeostasis inside the plant cell. For example, cortical MTs mainly affect initiation of trichome branches, and disruption of genes encoding MT-associated proteins usually produces trichomes with abnormal numbers of branches ( Oppenheimer et al., 1997; Krishnakumar and Oppenheimer, 1999; Burk et al., 2001; Buschmann et al., 2009; Nakamura and Hashimoto, 2009; Kong et al., 2010 ). By contrast, actin filaments mainly affect elongation of trichomes, and disruption of genes encoding actin-related proteins, such as components of the ARP2/3 actin nucleation complex and the upstream WAVE/SCAR regulatory complex ( W/SRC ), usually results in impaired trichome elongation but with normal branch number ( Mathur et al., 2003; Basu et al., 2004; Deeks et al., 2004; El-Assal Sel et al., 2004; El-Din El-Assal et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004; Szymanski, 2005; Zhang et al., 2005a; Djakovic et al., 2006; Le et al., 2006 ). Therefore, theoretically, mutation in a gene that participates in both processes would lead to trichome defects in both branching and elongation and would assist in the elucidation of the crosstalk between the MTs and the F-actin. However, such a central player, which directly links and integrates MTs and F-actin and further establishes the required cytoskeletal systems for trichome cell shaping, remains to be identified. KCBP ( kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein ) occurs solely within the plant kingdom, and uniquely in the kinesin superfamily. KCBP has a C-terminal motor head, beyond which locates a calmodulin-binding domain ( CBD ) at the extreme end of the C-terminus; besides KCBP, the CBD is only found in the sea urchin kinesin KinC. KCBP also contains a MyTH4-FERM tandem, which only occurs in several myosin families outside the plant kingdom, in its tail region at the N-terminus ( NT ) ; thus, KCBP has long been regarded as a chimera of kinesin with a myosin ( Abdel-Ghany et al., 2005 ). Using biotinylated calmodulin as a probe, KCBP was firstly isolated as a novel calmodulin-binding protein with a kinesin motor domain ( Reddy et al., 1996 ). In vitro biochemical assays showed that the CBD of KCBP binds calcium/calmodulin, which negatively regulates KCBP motor activity, and that the N-terminal tail, including the MyTH4-FERM domain, could co-sediment with MTs ( Narasimhulu and Reddy, 1998 ). Interestingly, genetic analysis of the zwichel ( zwi ) mutants, which have a shortened stalk and only two branches, revealed that the ZWICHEL ( ZWI ) gene encodes the KCBP protein ( H\u00fclskamp et al., 1994; Oppenheimer et al., 1997 ). KCBP was detected in mitotic MT arrays such as the preprophase band, the spindle, and the phragmoplast in various plants, indicating that it may play a role in cell division ( Bowser and Reddy, 1997; Smirnova et al., 1998; Preuss et al., 2003; Buschmann et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, loss of function in KCBP only produces a noticeable phenotype in trichomes, which are less-branched and contain shortened stalks and swollen, stunted branches ( Oppenheimer et al., 1997 ), providing a hint of clue that KCBP possibly plays the role involving in both cortical MTs and F-actin. However, whether KCBP localizes to cortical MTs in trichome cells is still an open question, cellular basis of defects in kcbp trichomes needs to be examined, direct evidence linking KCBP and F-actin is currently missing, and the role of the mysterious MyTH4-FERM domain remains to be unraveled. Here, we show that the N-terminal tail comprising the MyTH4 domain strongly binds to MTs, and the FERM domain physically binds to F-actin. During trichome morphogenesis, KCBP localizes to cortical MTs, distributes in a specific gradient, and is concentrated at the branching sites and the apexes of elongating branches. KCBP orchestrates the MT-actin interplay and is required to assemble the specific cytoskeletal configuration for trichome branching, elongation, and tip sharpening. Our findings build the direct link between the MT-based KCBP motor and the actin cytoskeleton, unravel the cellular basis controlling trichome cell shaping, and provide significant insights into the mechanisms of cytoskeletal regulation of cell shape determination.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Within a cell, a structure called the cytoskeleton provides a scaffold that supports the cell's shape. In both plant and animal cells, this scaffold is largely made of tube-like structures called microtubules and a web of filaments made of a protein called actin. In a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana, specialized hair-like cells usually protrude from the surface of leaves. These cells\u2014called trichomes\u2014are widely used to study how the cytoskeleton influences plant cell shape. Microtubules are required to regulate the number of branches these trichomes have. The actin filaments control the length of the trichomes, but it is not known how the two elements of the cytoskeleton interact to determine the overall shape of the trichomes. One protein that might help to co-ordinate microtubules and actin filaments is called kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein ( or KCBP for short ). This protein is a type of motor protein known as a kinesin and can move along microtubules, but it also contains a section called the MyTH4-FERM domain, which is found in another type of motor protein. When KCBP is removed from A. thaliana, the leaf trichomes are shorter and blunter than normal and have fewer branches. Here, Tian et al. investigated the role of KCBP in trichome development using a combination of genetic and microscopy techniques. The experiments show that the MyTH4-FERM domain of KCBP allows the protein to bind to both actin filaments and microtubules. During trichome formation, KCBP associates with the microtubules that are attached to the membrane that surrounds the cell. Particularly, high levels of the protein accumulate at the sites where branches will form and at the tips of developing branches. These branch tips have few microtubules but have many actin filaments. Further experiments revealed that KCBP acts as a hub that brings together microtubules and actin filaments to modulate the cytoskeleton during trichome formation. Tian et al. 's findings provide new insights into how the cytoskeleton influences plant cell shape. A future challenge is to understand how KCBP prevents microtubules forming at the tips of growing branches during trichome formation ."}

How this internal model benefits the implementation of skilled movement has remained unsolved. One prevailing theory has assumed that this internal model is used to compensate for gravity's mechanical effects on the body, such as to maintain invariant motor trajectories. Alternatively, gravity force could be used purposely and efficiently for the planning and execution of voluntary movements, thereby resulting in direction-depending kinematics. Here we experimentally interrogate these two hypotheses by measuring arm kinematics while varying movement direction in normal and zero-G gravity conditions. By comparing experimental results with model predictions, we show that the brain uses the internal model to implement control policies that take advantage of gravity to minimize movement effort.  It is always fascinating to witness the ability of acrobats and dancers to accomplish complex and elegant movements, graciously interacting with gravito-inertial forces. Computational theory postulates that this captivating performance is due to the ability of the brain to learn and store internal representations of environmental dynamics ( Wolpert and Ghahramani, 2000 ). On earth, gravity is the most ubiquitous and constant environmental feature. As such, a neural representation of gravity is created and stored through an internal model ( Papaxanthis et al., 1998a; Angelaki et al., 1999; Merfeld et al., 1999; McIntyre et al., 2001; Angelaki et al., 2004; Indovina et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2008; Crevecoeur et al., 2009; Gaveau\u00a0and\u00a0Papaxanthis, 2011; Laurens et al., 2013a, 2013b ). The need for an internal model of gravity arises because Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle prevents any single sensory receptor from encoding gravity without simultaneously also encoding inertial accelerations ( Einstein, 1908 ). The neural representation of gravity is thought to solve this ambiguity by multisensory statistical inference ( Angelaki et al., 1999; Merfeld et al., 1999; Angelaki et al., 2004; Laurens et al., 2013b ). An internal model of gravity has been shown to benefit the anticipation of a free falling object motion ( Zago and Lacquaniti, 2005; Zago et al., 2008; Lacquaniti et al., 2013 ), as well as the visual perception of allocentric vertical ( Van Pelt et al., 2005; De Vrijer et al., 2008; Elmore et al., 2014 ). However, whether and how an internal model of gravity benefits the planning and execution of skilled movement remains unknown. One influential viewpoint assumes a need for compensation; i. e., the internal model of gravity is used to predict and compensate for its mechanical effects on the body. This hypothesis has been motivated by experimental findings on arm movements in the presence of externally applied Coriolis, viscous force fields and interaction torques ( Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994; Gribble and Ostry, 1999; Pigeon et al., 2003 ). The main benefit of a compensation strategy would be the simplification of motor planning by allowing for invariant trajectories ( Hollerbach and Flash, 1982; Atkeson and Hollerbach, 1985 ). Current research in fields as diverse as neurorehabilitation, movement perception, or motor control modularity, assumes such a compensation principle ( Prange et al., 2009, 2012; Cook et al., 2013; Russo et al., 2014 ). An alternative perspective is based on a need for effort optimization, i. e., the internal model of gravity could be used to predict and take advantage of its mechanical effects on the body. It has been proposed that adaptation to the Earth\u2019s gravity field has allowed control policies to evolve that take advantage of environmental dynamics \u2013 use gravity as an assistive force to accelerate downward movements and as a resistive force to decelerate upward movements. This strategy, which has been formalized into a Minimum Smooth-Effort model, would result in movement kinematics that varies with direction ( Berret et al., 2008a; Gaveau et al., 2014 ). Indeed, upward movements were shown to have shorter time to peak velocity and larger curvature than downward movements, but such comparisons were until now largely qualitative ( Papaxanthis et al., 1998b; Gentili et al., 2007 ). Furthermore, upward/downward direction-dependent kinematics could also arise from the complex dynamics of the peripheral neuromuscular system. For example, the firing properties of extensor motoneurons ( pulling the arm downwards when upright ) are known to obey different rules from those of flexor motoneurons ( pulling upwards when uptight; Cotel et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2015 ). In addition, muscle force production generated by eccentric contraction ( elongation, e. g. downward movements for flexors ) is also known to obey differing rules from concentric contraction ( e. g. upward movement for flexors; for a review see Enoka, 1996 ). Because of these asymmetrical neuromuscular peripheral properties, upward/downward kinematic asymmetries cannot necessarily be attributed to gravity effort optimality ( i. e., minimization of muscular force to elevate and lower the arm ). Thus, a solid test of the effort optimization hypothesis has been lacking. Here, we explicitly distinguish between the compensation and effort optimization hypotheses with two critical experiments. First, we contrast predictions of optimal control models that either compensate or take advantage of gravity force effects. Then, we quantitatively compare these predictions with actual kinematic features of arm movements in multiple directions. Second, in order to discard a possible influence of peripheral neuromuscular mechanisms, we measure how differences in upward versus downward arm movement kinematics are influenced by the lack of gravity during the zero-G phase of parabolic flight. If directional asymmetries originate from asymmetric firing of flexor/extensor motoneurons, they should persist in the absence of gravity because motoneurons properties are not expected to change during the short zero-G phase of a parabolic flight ( Ishihara et al., 1996, 2002; for a review see Nagatomo et al., 2014 ). On the other hand, if they originate from eccentric versus concentric force production differences, directional asymmetries should cease to exist instantly in 0g because movement dynamics no longer differ for upward and downward movements ( Enoka, 1996 ). Alternatively, however, if directional asymmetries originate from neural planning processes that take advantage of the internal model of gravity, following a gradual recalibration of the gravity internal model, directional asymmetries should progressively decrease towards new optimal zero-G values ( McIntyre et al., 2001; Izawa et al., 2008; Snaterse et al., 2011 ). In support of the effort optimization hypothesis, we show that directional asymmetries are gradually eliminated during repeated exposure to the zero-G phase of parabolic flight.

For a movement to be successful, the brain must generate muscle contractions that take into account factors in the environment that might affect the movement. One such prominent environmental feature is gravity, and it is broadly believed that the brain develops and uses an internal representation of gravity to anticipate its effects on the limbs. How an internal representation of gravity helps limb movements to be made successfully is not known. Theorists have proposed that the brain could use the internal model of gravity to predict how to compensate for its mechanical effects \u2013 or, on the contrary, take advantage of them. Flying a plane in a \u201cparabolic\u201d arc creates a microgravity environment inside it that produces a feeling of weightlessness. Gaveau et al. asked volunteers to perform arm movements in normal earth gravity and in microgravity conditions. Under normal gravity, the volunteers made arm movements with speed profiles that differed according to movement direction. When they first performed these movements in microgravity, the speeds still differed according to direction. However, as the participants gained more experience of making the movements in microgravity, the speed at which upward and downward arm movements were made became more similar. Eventually movements were performed at the same speed in either direction. Comparing these results to numerical simulations revealed a sophisticated behavior where movements are organized to take advantage of the effects of gravity to minimize the effort that the muscles need to make. Further research into the neural mechanisms behind this optimization process could benefit the development of various rehabilitative and assistive technologies, such as brain-machine interfaces and robotic devices to guide and support limbs ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nAn outstanding challenge has been to understand the mechanism whereby proteins associate. We report here the results of exhaustively sampling the conformational space in protein\u2013protein association using a physics-based energy function. The agreement between experimental intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement ( PRE ) data and the PRE profiles calculated from the docked structures shows that the method captures both specific and non-specific encounter complexes. To explore the energy landscape in the vicinity of the native structure, the nonlinear manifold describing the relative orientation of two solid bodies is projected onto a Euclidean space in which the shape of low energy regions is studied by principal component analysis. Results show that the energy surface is canyon-like, with a smooth funnel within a two dimensional subspace capturing over 75% of the total motion. Thus, proteins tend to associate along preferred pathways, similar to sliding of a protein along DNA in the process of protein-DNA recognition.  Interactions between proteins play a central role in various aspects of the structural and functional organization of the cell. To recognize its partner, a protein must align its binding interface, usually a small fraction of the total surface, with a similarly small binding interface on the other protein ( Berg and von Hippel, 1985; Ubbink, 2009 ). Since all interactions are of relatively short range, the process must start with a diffusive search governed by Brownian motion, which brings the proteins to a \u2018macrocollision\u2019 to yield a transition state also known as the encounter complex ( Berg and von Hippel, 1985; von Hippel and Berg, 1989 ). The encounter complex can be thought of as an ensemble of conformations in which the two molecules can rotationally diffuse along each other, or participate in a series of \u2018microcollisions\u2019 that properly align the reactive groups. The second step of association consists of conformational rearrangements to the native complex. While it has been generally recognized that association proceeds through a transition state, little was known of the encounter complex structures and configurations as their populations are low, their lifetimes are short, and they are difficult to trap, rendering them essentially invisible to conventional structural and biophysical methods ( Iwahara and Clore, 2006 ). Novel experimental and improved computational methods, developed during the last decade, have the potential to provide information leading to better understanding of the nature of encounter complexes. On the experimental side, the major progress is due to the application of NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement ( PRE ), a technique that is exquisitely sensitive to the presence of lowly populated states in the fast exchange regime ( Clore, 2008; Clore and Iwahara, 2009; Fawzi et al., 2010 ). The detection of such intermediates requires introducing paramagnetic labels, one at a time, at a few sites on one of the interacting proteins, and measuring the transverse paramagnetic relaxation enhancement ( PRE ) rates, \u03932, of the backbone amide protons ( 1HN ) of the partner protein ( Tang et al., 2006 ). In a fast exchanging system, the observed value of \u03932 is the weighted average of the values for the various states present in solution ( Iwahara et al., 2004; Iwahara and Clore, 2006 ). Because \u03932 is dependent on the inverse sixth power of the distance ( <r\u22126> ) between the unpaired electron on the paramagnetic center and the observed proton, and because the \u03932 rates at short distances are very large owing to the large magnetic moment of the unpaired electrons, low-population intermediates can be detected. In particular, the observed intermolecular 1HN\u2212\u03932 rates and those back-calculated from the structure of the native complex generally differ for a number of residues, revealing regions that participate in transitional interactions ( Tang et al., 2006 ). Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement ( PRE ) techniques can provide distributions of distances between a paramagnetic ion and protons, indicating the presence and relative ratio of conformational sub-ensembles ( Tang et al., 2006; Suh et al., 2007; Clore and Iwahara, 2009; Fawzi et al., 2010 ), but determining the detailed structure of encounter complexes requires computational approaches. A semi-quantitative depiction of the minor species can be obtained by using restrained rigid-body simulated annealing refinement to minimize the difference between observed and calculated 1HN\u2212\u03932 rates ( Tang et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008 ). However, with the development of docking methods it is possible to globally sample the entire conformational space of two interacting proteins, generating all low energy states. Although in some cases binding is inherently coupled with folding ( Shoemaker et al., 2000; Zheng et al., 2012 ), a large class of protein complexes can be adequately described by a model that assumes essentially rigid association, possibly followed by refinement that allows for local changes in side chains and interacting loops ( Smith and Sternberg, 2002; Kozakov et al., 2006; Vajda and Kozakov, 2009 ). As demonstrated by the results of CAPRI ( Critical Assessment of Prediction of Interactions ) communitywide protein docking experiment, for such cases modern computational docking methods, including automated servers, are capable of generating docked conformations that agree well with the X-ray structure of the complex ( Lensink and Wodak, 2013 ). In particular, our program PIPER, based on the Fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) correlation approach, globally and systematically samples the conformational space of two interacting proteins on a dense grid using a physics based energy function ( Kozakov et al., 2006 ). The program is implemented in the heavily used server ClusPro ( Comeau et al., 2007 ), which yields good results when docking X-ray structures of two proteins with at most moderate backbone conformational changes upon binding ( Kozakov et al., 2010 ). Based on the results of CAPRI, Cluspro has been the best protein\u2013protein docking server for the last 5 years ( Kozakov et al., 2013; Lensink and Wodak, 2013 ). It is well known that, in addition to near-native structures, docking generally yields a large number of models that are similar to near-native ones in terms of energy, but may substantially differ in terms of geometry ( Vajda and Kozakov, 2009 ). Since such \u2018false positive\u2019 models do not predict the final bound complex, they are usually regarded as artifacts. However, using molecular mechanics energy functions without \u2018built-in\u2019 information on the native state it is reasonable to assume that the alternative low energy models represent encounter complexes that, in view of their favorable interactions, may occur along association pathways. Accordingly, we show here that using the large ensemble of low energy structures generated by docking provides better approximation of experimental PRE profiles than the one calculated only from the coordinates of the final complex. Since in docking calculations we start from unbound protein structures and systematically sample the entire conformational space, based on this result we can easily generate ensembles of encounter complexes for any pair of associating proteins. Once it is established that the energy function used for sampling the conformational space enables us to accurately predict both the native state and the ensemble of encounter complexes, and thus the energy function is valid beyond selecting the native structure of the complex, we proceed to characterizing the energy landscape in the 6D translational/rotational space near the native state ( McCammon, 1998; Camacho et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1999; Tovchigrechko and Vakser, 2001 ). We focus on the main binding funnel in a neighborhood of the native state, which is the most important region of the conformational space, containing over 90% of complex structures observed in the PRE experiments ( Iwahara and Clore, 2006; Tang et al., 2006; Clore and Iwahara, 2009; Fawzi et al., 2010 ). Since rigid body association occurs in a low dimensional space, the shape of the binding energy landscape can be studied in detail, in contrast to protein folding, which occurs in a very high dimensional space ( Dill and Chan, 1997 ). In spite of the low dimensionality, the analysis is far from simple in this highly curved space due to the interdependence of the coordinates ( Park, 1995; Park and Ravani, 1997; Shen et al., 2008; Mirzaei et al., 2012 ). However, one can transform the rotational space into a product of axis-angle representations using complex exponentials ( Park and Ravani, 1997 ). These so-called exponential parameters create a local one-to-one mapping between the nonlinear manifold of potential conformations and an Euclidean space ( Mirzaei et al., 2012 ), and thus the shape of low energy regions in the conformational space can be studied by classical principal component analysis ( PCA ) in the Euclidean space. Using PCA we will be able to determine whether any subspace can accommodate a large fraction of the structures, and whether there are energy barriers that restrict the distribution of encounter complexes in the vicinity of the native state. The most important result of our analysis is that the region of the space in a neighborhood of the native state invariably includes high energy barriers preventing the ligand from moving into a one- or two-dimensional restrictive subspace. Orthogonal to the restrictive subspace is a permissive subspace, in which the energy is relatively flat. Based on these results one can visualize the energy landscape as resembling a canyon-like terrain where the low energy areas ( at the bottom of the canyon ) lie in a lower dimensional subspace. Thus, within the range of physical interactions, two proteins sample only relatively small fractions of the conformational space, and converge toward the native state along preferred pathways. This result represents information that, in principle, could have been obtained by running molecular dynamics or Brownian dynamics simulations. However, a sufficiently dense sampling of conformational space by molecular dynamics is computationally very demanding, even when restricting considerations to a neighborhood of the native state ( Wang and Wade, 2003 ), whereas Brownian dynamics simulations usually rely on highly simplified protein models ( Camacho et al., 2000; Spaar and Helms, 2005 ). In contrast, we use detailed all-atom models and map the energy surface using two different physics-based energy functions. As will be shown, these differences do not significantly affect the results of the principal component analysis, suggesting that the reduction of dimensionality is an inherent property of the free energy landscape in protein\u2013protein association.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Proteins rarely act alone. Instead, they tend to bind to other proteins to form structures known as complexes. When two proteins come together to form a complex, they twist and turn through a series of intermediate states before they form the actual complex. These intermediate states are difficult to study because they don\u2019t last for very long, which means that our knowledge of how complexes are formed remains incomplete. One promising approach for studying the formation of complexes is called paramagnetic relaxation enhancement. In this technique certain areas in one of the proteins are labelled with magnetic particles, which produce signals when the two proteins are close to each other. Repeating the measurement several times with the magnetic particles in different positions provides information about the overall structure of the complex. Computational modelling can then be used to work out the fine details of the structure, including the shapes of the intermediate structures made by the proteins as they interact. A computer method called docking can be used to predict the most favourable positions that the proteins can take, relative to one another, in a complex. This involves calculating the energy contained in the system, with the correct structure having the lowest energy. Docking methods also predict protein models with slightly higher energies, but with structures that are radically different. Modellers usually ignore these structures, but comparing the docking results to paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data, Kozakov et al. found that these structures actually represent the intermediate states. Analysing the structure of the intermediate states revealed that the movement of the two proteins relative to one another is severely restricted as they form the final complex. Kozakov et al. found that proteins associate along preferred pathways, similar to the way a protein slides along DNA in the process of protein-DNA recognition. Knowing that the movement of the proteins is restricted in this way will enable researchers to improve the efficiency of docking calculations ."}

No previously described crustacean possesses a mushroom body as defined by strict morphological criteria although crustacean centers called hemiellipsoid bodies, which serve functions in sensory integration, have been viewed as evolutionarily convergent with mushroom bodies. Here, using key identifiers to characterize neural arrangements, we demonstrate insect-like mushroom bodies in stomatopod crustaceans ( mantis shrimps ). More than any other crustacean taxon, mantis shrimps display sophisticated behaviors relating to predation, spatial memory, and visual recognition comparable to those of insects. However, neuroanatomy-based cladistics suggesting close phylogenetic proximity of insects and stomatopod crustaceans conflicts with genomic evidence showing hexapods closely related to simple crustaceans called remipedes. We discuss whether corresponding anatomical phenotypes described here reflect the cerebral morphology of a common ancestor of Pancrustacea or an extraordinary example of convergent evolution.  Mushroom bodies are paired centers first identified in the brains of Hymenoptera ( Dujardin, 1850 ). They have been defined anatomically as a discrete neuropil composed of an abundance of parallel fibers originating from densely packed cell bodies, called globuli cells or Kenyon cells ( Sch\u00fcrmann F-W, 1973 ). Together, the parallel fibers form a distinctive peduncle that divides into two or more columnar tributaries termed lobes. Input and output neurons intersect parallel fibers down the length of each lobe, partitioning the lobe into discrete territories ( Mobbs, 1982; Li and Strausfeld, 1999 ). In most neopteran insects ( those insects possessing wings that bend over the abdomen ), parallel fibers provide systems of dendrites that form a distal cap- or cup-like domain called the calyx that receives afferents from olfactory neuropils and, in many species, from the optic lobes and gustatory centers as well. Calyces are absent in palaeopteran insects, such as odonates and Ephemeroptera ( dragonflies, darters, mayflies ), as well as in secondarily aquatic Neoptera such as diving beetles ( Strausfeld et al., 2009 ). Additional characters conventionally attributed to mushroom bodies include the presence of inhibitory feedback pathways from proximal to more distal levels of the lobes and calyx ( Leitch and Laurent, 1996 ). Mushroom bodies are further defined by enriched expression of proteins that are known to be essential for learning and memory functions in Drosophila ( Skoulakis et al., 1993; Skoulakis and Davis, 1996; Wang et al., 1998 ). The exclusive location of the paired mushroom bodies is laterally in the protocerebrum ( forebrain ), as they are in another mandibulate group, Myriapoda, which includes centipedes and millipedes ( Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015 ). Mushroom body function has been attributed to learning and memory ( Heisenberg, 2003 ). Currently, much of our knowledge about the roles of mushroom bodies comes from studies showing that convergence of populations of relay neurons from the antennal lobes onto sparse subsets of mushroom body Kenyon cells underlies multiple representations of odors ( Campbell et al., 2013; Perez-Orive et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2014 ) ; that mushroom bodies mediate appetitive and aversive long-term memory ( Waddell, 2013 ) ; and that they support allocentric and sequential place memory such as during trap-line foraging and obligate parasitoidism ( Mizunami et al., 1998; Montgomery et al., 2016; Farris and Schulmeister, 2011 ). Given that mushroom bodies have been identified in Myriapoda ( centipedes and millipedes ) and Chelicerata ( arachnids, horseshoe crabs, and sea spiders ) ( Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015 ), it might be assumed that these centers would be ubiquitous across arthropods. However, that assumption is awkward because the paired higher centers in the lateral protocerebrum of crustaceans share few, if any, of the identifying characteristics of lobed mushroom bodies as described above. These paired centers are the domed hemiellipsoid bodies. Particularly in malacostracan crustaceans, such as crayfish and shrimps, hemiellipsoid bodies may correspond functionally to mushroom bodies. In many species the hemiellipsoid bodies are subdivided into discrete lateral domains and levels ( Sullivan and Beltz, 2004 ). Their neurons originate from a dense population of minute cell bodies situated at the dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces of the lateral protocerebra, like the perikarya of globuli cells associated with the insect mushroom body. However, only in one group of crustaceans, the Anomura ( hermit crabs ), has there been any description of enriched proteins involved in learning and memory that characterize insect mushroom body lobes. In the land hermit crab Coenobita clypeatus, these proteins are confined to discrete concentric layers arranged at intervals through the depth of the hemiellipsoid body. Planar arrangements of pre- and postsynaptic neurons in these strata are comparable to orthogonal networks observed in the mushroom body lobes of insects. Hence, the hemiellipsoid bodies of land hermit crabs are interpreted as homologues of insect mushroom bodies ( Brown and Wolff, 2012 ). But the question remains whether such circuits have evolved convergently, particularly because marine hermit crabs show no evidence of orthogonal circuitry, nor do species of the related orders, Astacidea ( crayfish and lobsters ) and Brachyura ( true crabs ). Nevertheless, crustaceans might be expected to have evolved insect-like mushroom bodies if, like insects, they engage in behaviors that demand high level sensory associations and memory ( Withers et al., 2008 ), such as trap-line foraging ( Montgomery et al., 2016 ), rational courtship ( Arbuthnott et al., 2017 ), individual recognition, establishment and defense of territories, and obligate predation by stealth ( Libersat and Gal, 2013; Berens et al., 2017;\ufeff Alcock and Bailey, 1997 ). Stomatopoda ( mantis shrimps ), which is the sister group of all eumalacostracan crustaceans ( Wolfe et al., 2016 ), engage in such behaviors. Stomatopods possess the most elaborate visual systems of any arthropod, where each eye moves independently of the other, and is endowed with binocular vision and numerous color- and polarization-sensitive channels, including channels for detecting circular polarization ( Marshall et al., 2007 ). Mantis shrimps frequent established hunting territories distant from their lair ( Cronin et al., 2006 ). Like insects, mantis shrimps form associative memories of kin and place through sensory integration employing the modalities of vision and olfaction ( Caldwell and Lamp, 1981 ) and can be trained in discrimination-learning paradigms using color and polarized light stimuli ( Marshall et al., 1999 ). Individuals remember conspecifics with which they have had aversive or non-aversive encounters ( Caldwell, 1992 ). These behaviors require a brain equipped for memory of places, territories and individual recognition ( Marshall et al., 1996 ). Here we report the first comprehensive description of centers in Stomatopoda that correspond in detail to the mushroom bodies of insects. Their similarity of brain structures has suggested phylogenetic proximity of insects and malacostracan crustaceans ( Strausfeld and Andrew, 2011 ). However, genomic evidence argues strongly that insects are instead most closely related to blind, morphologically simple cave-dwelling crustaceans, called remipedes ( Regier et al., 2005; Oakley et al., 2013; von Reumont et al., 2012; Schwentner et al., 2017 ), which like all crustaceans other than stomatopods lack mushroom bodies. The identification of mushroom bodies in mantis shrimps sheds new light on insect-crustacean relationships. We show that, within more recently radiating eumalacostracan lineages, the neuronal composition and organization of mushroom body morphology appear to have undergone radical modification resulting in centers unrecognizable as mushroom bodies but retaining the function of a sensory integrator. The earlier identification of a hexapod-malacostracan-like brain in a fossil stem arthropod ( Ma et al., 2015 ) together with the present results argues for an elaborate ancestral cerebral organization already present in the lower Cambrian.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: With more than four million species, arthropods are the largest and most diverse group of animals on the planet and include, for example, crustaceans, insects and spiders. They are defined by their segmented bodies, hard outer skeletons and jointed limbs. All arthropods share a common ancestor that lived more than 550 million years ago. Exactly how this ancestral arthropod gave rise to the myriad species that exist today is unclear but we know that at some point the arthropod family tree split into branches, one of which went on to become the crustaceans. The crustacean branch then split again, giving rise to a line of descendants that would become the insects. But although insects evolved from crustaceans, the brains of insects possess structures that those of crustaceans do not. Known as mushroom bodies, these structures help to form and store memories. Their absence in crustaceans has therefore been an enduring mystery. Wolff et al. now add a piece to the puzzle by showing that one group of modern-day crustaceans, the mantis shrimps, does in fact possess mushroom bodies. By visualizing cells and pathways within the brains of mantis shrimps, and also a number of closely related species, Wolff et al. show that only these shrimps possess true mushroom bodies. However, some of the mantis shrimp\u2019s close relatives possess a few attributes of these structures. This suggests that mushroom bodies are evolutionarily ancient structures that arose in a common ancestor of insects and crustaceans, before being lost or radically modified in most of the crustaceans. So why did this happen ? Mantis shrimps are top predators with excellent vision that hunt over considerable distances, requiring them to evaluate and memorize complex features of their environment. These cognitive demands, which might not be shared by other crustaceans, may have led to the mantis shrimps retaining their mushroom bodies. Further research into the brains and behavior of the mantis shrimp may provide insights into how mushroom bodies construct memories of a complex sensory world ."}

The PFH predicts that ectopic gene activation requires the sequential activity of qualitatively different TFs. We tested the PFH by expressing the endodermal PF FOXA1 and non-PF HNF4A in K562 lymphoblast cells. While co-expression of FOXA1 and HNF4A activated a burst of endoderm-specific gene expression, we found no evidence for a functional distinction between these two TFs. When expressed independently, both TFs bound and opened inaccessible sites, activated endodermal genes, and \u2018pioneered\u2019 for each other, although FOXA1 required fewer copies of its motif for binding. A subset of targets required both TFs, but the predominant mode of action at these targets did not conform to the sequential activity predicted by the PFH. From these results, we hypothesize an alternative to the PFH where \u2018pioneer activity\u2019 depends not on categorically different TFs but rather on the affinity of interaction between TF and DNA.  Transcription factors ( TFs ) face steric hindrance when instances of their motifs are occluded by nucleosomes ( Kornberg, 1974; Kaplan et al., 2009 ). This barrier prevents spurious transcription but must be overcome during development when TFs activate batteries of silent genes. The pioneer factor hypothesis ( PFH ) describes how TFs recognize and activate nucleosome-occluded targets. According to the PFH, categorically different TFs cooperate sequentially to activate their targets. Pioneer factors ( PFs ) bind to and open inaccessible sites and then recruit non-pioneer factors ( non-PFs ) that are responsible for recruiting additional factors to initiate gene expression ( McPherson et al., 1993; Shim et al., 1998; Cirillo et al., 1998; Cirillo et al., 2002 ). PFs also play a primary role in cellular reprogramming by first engaging silent regulatory sites of ectopic lineages ( Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014 ). Continuous overexpression of PFs and non-PFs can lead to a variety of lineage conversions ( Wapinski et al., 2013; Matsuda et al., 2019; Soufi et al., 2015; Soufi et al., 2012; Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011; Morris et al., 2014 ). The conversion from embryonic fibroblasts to induced endoderm progenitors offers one clear example ( Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011; Morris et al., 2014 ). This reprogramming cocktail combines the canonical PF FOXA1 ( Cirillo et al., 2002 ) and non-PF HNF4A ( Karagianni et al., 2020 ) and is suggested to rely upon the sequential activity of FOXA1 followed by HNF4A ( Horisawa et al., 2020 ). The PFH makes strong predictions about the activities of ectopically expressed PFs and non-PFs. Because PFs are defined by their ability to bind nucleosome-occluded instances of their motifs, the PFH predicts that PFs should bind to a large fraction of their motifs. However, similar to other TFs, PFs only bind a limited subset of their inaccessible motifs ( Barozzi et al., 2014; Mayran et al., 2018; Donaghey et al., 2018; Manandhar et al., 2017 ). There are chromatin states that are prohibitive to PF binding ( Mayran et al., 2018; Zaret and Mango, 2016 ), and, in at least two cases, FOXA1 requires help from other TFs to bind at its sites ( Donaghey et al., 2018; Swinstead et al., 2016 ). These examples suggest that PFs are not always sufficient to open inaccessible chromatin. The PFH also predicts that non-PFs should only bind at accessible sites, yet the bacterial protein LexA can pioneer inaccessible sites in mammalian cells ( Miller and Widom, 2003 ). These observations, and the absence of direct genome-wide interrogations of the PFH, prompted us to design experiments to test major predictions made by the PFH using FOXA1 and HNF4A as a model PF and non-PF. To test these predictions, we expressed FOXA1 and HNF4A separately and together in K562 lymphoblast cells and then measured their effects on DNA-binding, chromatin accessibility, and gene activation. In contrast to the predictions of the PFH, we found that both FOXA1 and HNF4A could independently bind to inaccessible instances of their motifs, induce chromatin accessibility, and activate endoderm-specific gene expression. The only notable distinction between the two factors was that HNF4A required more copies of its motif to bind. When expressed together, co-binding could only be explained in a minority of cases by sequential FOXA1 and HNF4A activity. Instead, most co-bound sites required concurrent co-expression of both factors, which suggests cooperativity between these TFs at certain repressive genomic locations. We suggest that our findings present an alternative to the PFH that eliminates the categorical distinction between PFs and non-PFs and instead posits that the energy required to pioneer occluded sites ( \u2018pioneer activity\u2019 ) comes from the affinity of interaction between TFs and DNA.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Cells only use a fraction of their genetic information to make the proteins they need. The rest is carefully packaged away and tightly bundled in structures called nucleosomes. This physically shields the DNA from being accessed by transcription factors \u2013 the molecular actors that can read genes and kickstart the protein production process. Effectively, the genetic sequences inside nucleosomes are being silenced. However, during development, transcription factors must overcome this nucleosome barrier and activate silent genes to program cells. The pioneer factor hypothesis describes how this may be possible: first, \u2018pioneer\u2019 transcription factors can bind to and \u2018open up\u2019 nucleosomes to make target genes accessible. Then, non-pioneer factors can access the genetic sequence and recruit cofactors that begin copying the now-exposed genetic information. The widely accepted theory is based on studies of two proteins \u2013 FOXA1, an archetypal pioneer factor, and HNF4A, a non-pioneer factor \u2013 but the predictions of the pioneer factor hypothesis have yet to be explicitly tested. To do so, Hansen et al. expressed FOXA1 and HNF4A, separately and together, in cells which do not usually make these proteins. They then assessed how the proteins could bind to DNA and impact gene accessibility and transcription. The experiments demonstrate that FOXA1 and HNF4A do not necessarily follow the two-step activation predicted by the pioneer factor hypothesis. When expressed independently, both transcription factors bound and opened inaccessible sites, activated target genes, and \u2018pioneered\u2019 for each other. Similar patterns were observed across the genome. The only notable distinction between the two factors was that FOXA1, the archetypal pioneering factor, required fewer copies of its target sequence to bind DNA than HNF4A. These findings led Hansen et al. to propose an alternative theory to the pioneer factor hypothesis which eliminates the categorical distinction between pioneer and non-pioneer factors. Overall, this work has implications for how biologists understand the way that transcription factors activate silent genes during development ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe key component of the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) controlling permeability, selectivity, and the speed of nucleocytoplasmic transport is an assembly of natively unfolded polypeptides, which contain phenylalanine-glycine ( FG ) binding sites for nuclear transport receptors. The architecture and dynamics of the FG-network have been refractory to characterization due to the paucity of experimental methods able to probe the mobility and density of the FG-polypeptides and embedded macromolecules within intact NPCs. Combining fluorescence polarization, super-resolution microscopy, and mathematical analyses, we examined the rotational mobility of fluorescent probes at various locations within the FG-network under different conditions. We demonstrate that polarization PALM ( p-PALM ) provides a rich source of information about low rotational mobilities that are inaccessible with bulk fluorescence anisotropy approaches, and anticipate that p-PALM is well-suited to explore numerous crowded cellular environments. In total, our findings indicate that the NPC\u2019s internal organization consists of multiple dynamic environments with different local properties.  Intracellular environments are highly crowded, with typical local macromolecular concentrations of\u00a0~80\u2013400 mg/mL, and some cellular environments contain only\u00a0~50% water ( Kuznetsova et al., 2014 ). Under crowded conditions, excluded volume effects and local interactions can change protein activities by over an order of magnitude compared with the 'dilute' solutions typically used for most in vitro studies ( Aumiller et al., 2014 ). Crowded conditions can affect protein folding, structure, shape, conformational stability and dynamics, binding interactions, and enzymatic activity ( Kuznetsova et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2008 ). Biological polymers play central roles in generating a variety of crowded environments. For example, the polymers in mucus, the extracellular matrix, the cytoskeleton, the vitreous humor of the eye, and the Nuclear Pore Complex ( NPC ) produce complex environments that restrict diffusion and trap molecules ( Leterrier, 2001; Lieleg and Ribbeck, 2011 ). In addition, the numerous distinct bodies/granules within the nucleus and the cytoplasm have been interpreted to form via a phase separation-like mechanism due to high local concentrations of self-cohesive nucleic acid and/or intrinsically disordered protein polymers ( Aumiller et al., 2014; Toretsky and Wright, 2014 ). Characterization of the physical, structural, dynamical, and functional properties of these crowded environments remains challenging due to the dearth of appropriate tools that are needed to investigate the complexity and heterogeneity of these environments on the nanoscale. One example of a crowded environment is the pore of the NPC, which mediates bidirectional traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The translocation passageway of the NPC is occupied by hundreds of intrinsically disordered polypeptides ( Lim et al., 2008; Peleg and Lim, 2010; Suntharalingam and Wente, 2003 ), 50\u2013100 nuclear transport receptors ( NTRs ) ( Lowe et al., 2015; Tokunaga et al., 2008 ), and protein and nucleic acid cargo complexes moving in opposite directions. NTRs are classified as importins or exportins, reflecting their ability to carry cargos into or out of the nucleus, respectively ( for reviews, see [Chook and S\u00fcel, 2011; G\u00fcttler and G\u00f6rlich, 2011; Jamali et al., 2011; Stewart, 2007; Wente and Rout, 2010] ). On the nuclear side, RanGTP promotes disassembly of NTR/cargo import complexes, freeing the cargo and allowing NTRs to diffuse back to the cytoplasm ( Chook and Blobel, 2001; Izaurralde et al., 1997; Rexach and Blobel, 1995; Siomi et al., 1997 ). NTR/cargo/RanGTP export complexes are disassembled on the cytoplasmic side after GTP hydrolysis, which results from interactions with RanGAP and a Ran-binding protein ( RanBP ) ( Bischoff and G\u00f6rlich, 1997; Bischoff et al., 1994; G\u00fcttler and G\u00f6rlich, 2011; Kutay et al., 1997a; Okamura et al., 2015 ). Many of these assembly and disassembly reactions are coordinated to occur at the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic exits of the NPC\u2019s central pore ( Sun et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2008 ). Exactly how cargo complexes are specifically recognized and yet rapidly migrate in milliseconds ( Dange et al., 2008; Gr\u00fcnwald and Singer, 2010; Kubitscheck et al., 2005; Tu et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2004; Yang and Musser, 2006a ) through the NPC\u2019s crowded environment remains enigmatic. NPCs are large ( ~60\u2013120 MDa ) structures with octagonal rotational symmetry. They are comprised of\u00a0~30 different nuclear pore proteins ( nucleoporins, or Nups ), each of which are thought to be present in an integer multiple of eight copies ( Cronshaw et al., 2002; Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003; Mi et al., 2015; Ori et al., 2013; Rout and Aitchison, 2001 ). The vertebrate NPC has an outer diameter of\u00a0~120 nm, and extends\u00a0~200 nm along the transport axis ( Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003; Stoffler et al., 1999 ). Eight flexible filaments extend\u00a0~50 nm into the cytoplasm, and an additional eight filaments extend\u00a0~75 nm into the nucleoplasm and terminate in a ring to form the nuclear basket ( Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003; Stoffler et al., 2003 ). In humans, the hourglass-shaped central pore has a minimum diameter of\u00a0~50 nm and a length of\u00a0~85 nm ( Maimon et al., 2012 ). Within this large pore and decorating its openings is a network of\u00a0~200\u2013250 intrinsically disordered polypeptides, which generates a permeability barrier impeding macromolecular transport ( Lim et al., 2008; Ori et al., 2013; Peleg and Lim, 2010; Suntharalingam and Wente, 2003 ) and which is particularly selective against larger cargos ( Mohr et al., 2009; Popken et al., 2015; Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, 2001; Timney et al., 2016 ). These disordered polypeptides contain, in total, 3000\u20134000 phenylalanine-glycine ( FG ) repeats to which NTRs transiently bind as they carry cargos through NPCs ( Cronshaw et al., 2002; Denning et al., 2003; Rout et al., 2000; Strawn et al., 2004; Tran and Wente, 2006 ). We term this assembly of intrinsically disordered FG-containing polypeptides the FG-network. Each FG-containing nucleoporin ( FG-Nup ) has a globular anchor domain that is embedded in or attached to the NPC scaffold, and thus, it acts as an anchor point for the flexible and mobile FG-domain. The FG-repeat motifs are separated by short ( ~10\u201320 amino acid residues ), largely hydrophilic segments ( Denning and Rexach, 2007; Yamada et al., 2010 ). The FG-domains do not form readily recognizable secondary structures, but rather are more appropriately described as flexible polymers with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains ( Lim et al., 2006; Yamada et al., 2010 ). The FG-network is sufficiently fluid and mobile that it is rapidly displaced by transporting cargos, which can be up to\u00a0~40 nm in diameter ( Frey and G\u00f6rlich, 2009; Hough et al., 2015; Lim et al., 2007; Milles et al., 2015; Pant\u00e9 and Kann, 2002 ). The \u2018polymer brush\u2019 ( Lim et al., 2006; Peleg and Lim, 2010 ) and \u2018hydrogel\u2019 ( Frey and G\u00f6rlich, 2007; Frey et al., 2006 ) models are the most widely cited descriptions of the biophysical nature of FG-polypeptide assemblies. These models are two extremes in the model space describing the potential morphologies and properties of the FG-Nup assemblies within the NPC ( Eisele et al., 2013; Vovk et al., 2016 ). The polymer brush model postulates that the FG-polypeptides are largely non-interacting ( beyond steric repulsion ), relatively extended and minimally entangled ( Lim et al., 2006; Peleg and Lim, 2010 ), and their spatial assemblies are stabilized mostly by entropic forces ( Vovk et al., 2016 ). The hydrogel model posits that the FG-polypeptides exhibit significant inter- and intra-strand cohesiveness via FG-FG interactions, which results in a connected dense network ( Frey and G\u00f6rlich, 2007; Frey and G\u00f6rlich, 2009; Frey et al., 2006; H\u00fclsmann et al., 2012 ). A hybrid, two-gate model postulates brush-like structures on both cytoplasmic and nuclear sides of the NPC, suitable for binding and ( dis ) assembly reactions, and a central cohesive structure in the center of the pore that provides the permeability barrier ( Patel et al., 2007 ). The spatial distribution of functional activities in this two-gate model is supported by single molecule transport results ( Sun et al., 2013; Tu et al., 2013 ). Quantitative modeling of FG-polypeptide behavior predicts a smooth transition between brush-like and gel-like behaviors in response to relatively small changes in physical properties and favors a picture intermediate between a brush and a gel ( Vovk et al., 2016 ). The magnitude of the inter- and intra-chain cohesiveness that differentiates these two descriptions could be different for different FG-polypeptides, or different segments of the same FG-polypeptides, in distinct spatial locations within the NPC ( Vovk et al., 2016 ). Avidity calculations indicate that the multivalent affinities of NTRs depend critically upon the local free FG-repeat concentration ( Tu et al., 2013 ). In agreement with these predictions, experimental results indicate that some sub-populations of NTRs have very long dissociation times, and therefore, they potentially can form an integral part of the permeability barrier ( Kapinos et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2015; Schleicher et al., 2014 ). Taken together, these findings suggest that the FG-polypeptides and NTRs act together to form different local environments with different properties within the NPC ( Coalson et al., 2015; Ghavami et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2015; Eskandari Nasrabad et al., 2016; Osmanovi\u0107 et al., 2013; Tagliazucchi et al., 2013; Yamada et al., 2010 ). Considering the uncertainty in the structural arrangement of and interactions between FG-polypeptides, and knowing that many tens to over a hundred macromolecules ( including NTRs, Ran, and cargos ) interact with the FG-network during steady-state transport ( Abu-Arish et al., 2009; Lowe et al., 2015; Tokunaga et al., 2008 ), developing a general picture of FG-polypeptide distributions and local crowding conditions, and discerning their functional effects on cargo transport, is a challenging problem, but nevertheless essential for establishing the mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic transport and its implications. Here, we used the super-resolution approach photoactivated localization microscopy ( PALM ) ( Betzig et al., 2006 ) to probe the locations of a number of FG-polypeptides and transport-related proteins within the NPC. Our main focus, however, was on using polarization PALM ( p-PALM ) ( Gould et al., 2008 ) to measure rotational mobility, which is sensitive to local crowding conditions, and which enables probing of the local properties of crowded macromolecular assemblies that are currently inaccessible by other means. Crucially, we developed a theoretical model that enables detailed analysis of the experimental p-PALM data in terms of rotational diffusion constants. While numerous previous super-resolution approaches on NPCs utilized fixed samples, and most concentrated on scaffold structural questions ( L\u00f6schberger et al., 2014, 2012; Lowe et al., 2015; Otsuka et al., 2016; Pleiner et al., 2016; Szymborska et al., 2013; Winterflood and Ewers, 2014 ), the NPCs in our samples were fully functional since our goal was to probe the properties of the FG-network, which is intrinsically dynamic. The results of our analysis of protein localization and local mobility within the NPC demonstrate that the FG-network is heterogeneous with regard to molecular crowding and that this can be influenced by the presence of embedded proteins, which argues for a remarkable complexity in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways and their regulation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Most of the genetic material inside an animal cell is enclosed within a compartment called the nucleus. This compartment is separated from the rest of the cell by the nuclear envelope, a double-membrane structure containing thousands of pores that selectively allow certain molecules ( collectively referred to as cargo ) to enter and exit the nucleus. The movement of cargo through the pores is controlled by large groups of proteins called nuclear pore complexes. The pore is at the center of the complex and is filled by a selective barrier made of an extensive network of flexible proteins known as the FG-network. Other proteins known as nuclear transport receptors bind to the proteins in the FG-network and carry cargos through the barrier. The properties of the nuclear pore barrier and how it rapidly selects the right cargos have been difficult to study, in part, because the barrier network is constantly changing and is crowded with hundreds of transport receptors. New techniques are needed to investigate such highly crowded environments inside cells. Now, Fu et al. use a technique called polarization photoactivated localization microscopy ( p-PALM ) to explore the molecular crowding within the nuclear pore barrier in human cells. This technique measures the freedom with which a single molecule embedded in the network can rotate, providing information about the local environment. In a crowded environment, it is harder for the probe molecule to rotate as it is more likely to bump into other molecules. Fu et al. found that there are different levels of crowding within the barrier. This is consistent with previous ideas of how the pore barrier could work, which propose that the nuclear transport receptors are less tightly packed in the center of the FG-network. This enables transport receptor and cargo complexes to move more rapidly through the center of the pore. The molecular crowding in the barrier of nuclear pores parallels that observed in other cellular compartments that also rely on assemblies of proteins with flexible structures. Thus, future work using p-PALM is expected to reveal more details about the biophysical properties of nuclear pores as well as those of other structures inside cells ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nTranscription activator-like effectors ( TALEs ) bind DNA through an array of tandem 34-residue repeats. How TALE repeat domains wrap around DNA, often extending more than 1. 5 helical turns, without using external energy is not well understood. Here, we examine the kinetics of DNA binding of TALE arrays with varying numbers of identical repeats. Single molecule fluorescence analysis and deterministic modeling reveal conformational heterogeneity in both the free- and DNA-bound TALE arrays. Our findings, combined with previously identified partly folded states, indicate a TALE instability that is functionally important for DNA binding. For TALEs forming less than one superhelical turn around DNA, partly folded states inhibit DNA binding. In contrast, for TALEs forming more than one turn, partly folded states facilitate DNA binding, demonstrating a mode of \u2018functional instability\u2019 that facilitates macromolecular assembly. Increasing repeat number slows down interconversion between the various DNA-free and DNA-bound states.  Transcription activator-like effectors ( TALEs ) are bacterial proteins containing a domain of tandem DNA-binding repeats as well as a eukaryotic transcriptional activation domain ( Kay et al., 2007; R\u00f6mer et al., 2007 ). The repeat domain binds double stranded DNA with a register of one repeat per base pair. Specificity is determined by the sequence identity at positions twelve and thirteen in each TALE repeat, which are referred to as repeat variable diresidues ( RVDs ) ( Boch et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2015; Moscou and Bogdanove, 2009 ). This specificity code has enabled design of TALE-based tools for transcriptional control ( Cong et al., 2012; Geissler et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Mahfouz et al., 2012; Morbitzer et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011 ), DNA modifications ( Maeder et al., 2013 ), in-cell microscopy ( Ma et al., 2013; Miyanari et al., 2013 ), and genome editing ( TALENs ) ( Christian et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011 ). TALE repeat domains wrap around DNA in a continuous superhelix of 11. 5 TALE repeats per turn ( Deng et al., 2012; Mak et al., 2012 ). Because TALEs contain on average 17. 5 repeats ( Boch and Bonas, 2010 ), most form over 1. 5 full turns around DNA. Many multisubunit proteins that form rings around DNA require energy in the form of ATP to open or close around DNA ( reviewed in O'Donnell and Kuriyan, 2006 ), yet TALEs are capable of wrapping around DNA without energy from nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis. One possibility is that TALEs bind DNA through an energetically accessible open conformation. Consistent with this possibility, we previously demonstrated that TALE arrays can populate partly folded and broken states ( Geiger-Schuller and Barrick, 2016 ). By measuring the length-dependence of protein stability and employing a statistical mechanics Ising model, we previously described several different TALE partly folded states termed \u2018end-frayed\u2019, \u2018internally unfolded\u2019, and \u2018interfacially fractured\u2019 states. Although the calculated populations of partly folded states in TALE repeat arrays are small, they are many orders of magnitude larger than populations of partly folded states in other previously studied repeat arrays ( consensus ankyrin [Aksel et al., 2011]\u00a0and DHR proteins [Geiger-Schuller et al., 2018] ) suggesting a potential functional role for the high populations of partially folded states in TALE repeat arrays. Consensus TALEs ( cTALEs ) are designed homopolymeric arrays composed of the most commonly observed residue at each of the 34 positions of the repeat ( Geiger-Schuller and Barrick, 2016 ). In addition to simplifying analysis of folding and conformational heterogeneity in this study, the consensus approach simplifies analysis of DNA binding, eliminating contributions from sequence heterogeneity and providing an easy means of site-specific labeling. Here we characterize DNA binding kinetics of cTALEs using total internal reflection fluorescence single-molecule microscopy. We find that consensus TALE arrays bind to DNA reversibly, with high affinity. Analysis of the dwell-times of the on- and off-states reveals multiphasic binding and unbinding kinetics, suggesting conformational heterogeneity in both the free and DNA bound state. We develop a deterministic optimization analysis that supports such a model, and provides rate constants for conformational changes in the unbound and bound states, and rate constants for binding and dissociation. Comparing the dynamics observed here to previously characterized local unfolding suggests that locally unfolded states inhibit binding of short cTALE arrays ( less than one full superhelical turn around DNA ), whereas they promote binding of long arrays ( more than one full superhelical turn ). Whereas local folding of transcription factors upon DNA binding is well documented ( Spolar and Record, 1994 ), local unfolding in the binding process is not. Our results present a new mode of transcription factor binding where the major conformer in the unbound state is fully folded, requiring partial unfolding prior to binding. The critical role of such high energy partly folded states is an exciting example of \u2018functional instability\u2019, in which formation of a functional complex is impeded by the fully folded native state, and is instead facilitated by partial disruption of native structure.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The DNA contains all the information needed to build an organism. It is made up of two strands that wind around each other like a twisted ladder to form the double helix. The strands consist of sugar and phosphate molecules, which attach to one of for bases. Genes are built from DNA, and contain specific sequences of these bases. Being able to modify DNA by deleting, inserting or changing certain sequences allows researchers to engineer tissues or even organisms for therapeutical and practical applications. One of these gene editing tools is the so-called transcription activator-like effector protein ( or TALE for short ). TALE proteins are derived from bacteria and are built from simple repeating units that can be linked to form a string-like structure. They have been found to be unstable proteins. To bind to DNA, TALES need to follow the shape of the double helix, adopting a spiral structure, but how exactly TALE proteins thread their way around the DNA is not clear. To investigate this, Geiger-Schuller et al. monitored single TALE units using fluorescent microscopy. This way, they could exactly measure the time it takes for single TALE proteins to bind and release DNA. The results showed that some TALE proteins bind DNA quickly, whereas others do this slowly. Using a computer model to analyze the different speeds of binding suggested that the fast binding comes from partly unfolded proteins that quickly associate with DNA, and that the slow binding comes from rigid, folded TALE proteins, which have a harder time wrapping around DNA. This suggest that the unstable nature of TALEs, helps these proteins to bind to DNA and turn on genes. These findings will help to design future TALE-based gene editing tools and also provide more insight into how large molecules can assemble into complex structures. A next step will be to identify TALE repeats with unstable states and to test TALE gene editing tools that have intentionally placed unstable units ."}

A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats\u2019 virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-transmitting viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.  Bats have received much attention in recent years for their role as reservoir hosts for emerging viral zoonoses, including rabies and related lyssaviruses, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS coronavirus ( Calisher et al., 2006; Wang and Anderson, 2019 ). In most non-Chiropteran mammals, henipaviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses induce substantial morbidity and mortality, display short durations of infection, and elicit robust, long-term immunity in hosts surviving infection ( Nicholls et al., 2003; Hooper et al., 2001; Mahanty and Bray, 2004 ). Bats, by contrast, demonstrate no obvious disease symptoms upon infection with pathogens that are highly virulent in non-volant mammals ( Schountz et al., 2017 ) but may, instead, support viruses as long-term persistent infections, rather than transient, immunizing pathologies ( Plowright et al., 2016 ). Recent research advances are beginning to shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which bats avoid pathology from these otherwise virulent pathogens ( Brook and Dobson, 2015 ). Bats leverage a suite of species-specific mechanisms to limit viral load, which include host receptor sequence incompatibilities for some bat-virus combinations ( Ng et al., 2015; Takadate et al., 2020 ) and constitutive expression of the antiviral cytokine, IFN-\u03b1, for others ( Zhou et al., 2016 ). Typically, the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will induce secretion of type I interferon proteins ( IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 ), which promote expression and translation of interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) in neighboring cells and render them effectively antiviral ( Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006 ). In some bat cells, the transcriptomic blueprints for this IFN response are expressed constitutively, even in the absence of stimulation by viral RNA or DNA ( Zhou et al., 2016 ). In non-flying mammals, constitutive IFN expression would likely elicit widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection, but bats support unique adaptations to combat inflammation ( Zhang et al., 2013; Ahn et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018; Pavlovich et al., 2018 ) that may have evolved to mitigate metabolic damage induced during flight ( Kacprzyk et al., 2017 ). The extent to which constitutive IFN-\u03b1 expression signifies constitutive antiviral defense in the form of functional IFN-\u03b1 protein remains unresolved. In bat cells constitutively expressing IFN-\u03b1, some protein-stimulated, downstream ISGs appear to be also constitutively expressed, but additional ISG induction is nonetheless possible following viral challenge and stimulation of IFN-\u03b2 ( Zhou et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018 ). Despite recent advances in molecular understanding of bat viral tolerance, the consequences of this unique bat immunity on within-host virus dynamics\u2014and its implications for understanding zoonotic emergence\u2014have yet to be elucidated. The field of \u2018virus dynamics\u2019 was first developed to describe the mechanistic underpinnings of long-term patterns of steady-state viral load exhibited by patients in chronic phase infections with HIV, who appeared to produce and clear virus at equivalent rates ( Nowak and May, 2000; Ho et al., 1995 ). Models of simple target cell depletion, in which viral load is dictated by a bottom-up resource supply of infection-susceptible host cells, were first developed for HIV ( Perelson, 2002 ) but have since been applied to other chronic infections, including hepatitis-C virus ( Neumann et al., 1998 ), hepatitis-B virus ( Nowak et al., 1996 ) and cytomegalovirus ( Emery et al., 1999 ). Recent work has adopted similar techniques to model the within-host dynamics of acute infections, such as influenza A and measles, inspiring debate over the extent to which explicit modeling of top-down immune control can improve inference beyond the basic resource limitation assumptions of the target cell model ( Baccam et al., 2006; Pawelek et al., 2012; Saenz et al., 2010; Morris et al., 2018 ). To investigate the impact of unique bat immune processes on in vitro viral kinetics, we first undertook a series of virus infection experiments on bat cell lines expressing divergent interferon phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model elucidating the dynamics of within-host viral spread. We evaluated our theoretical model analytically independent of the data, then fit the model to data recovered from in vitro experimental trials in order to estimate rates of within-host virus transmission and cellular progression to antiviral status under diverse assumptions of absent, induced, and constitutive immunity. Finally, we confirmed our findings in spatially-explicit stochastic simulations of fitted time series from our mean field model. We hypothesized that top-down immune processes would overrule classical resource-limitation in bat cell lines described as constitutively antiviral in the literature, offering a testable prediction for models fit to empirical data. We further predicted that the most robust antiviral responses would be associated with the most rapid within-host virus propagation rates but also protect cells against virus-induced mortality to support the longest enduring infections in tissue culture.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Bats can carry viruses that are deadly to other mammals without themselves showing serious symptoms. In fact, bats are natural reservoirs for viruses that have some of the highest fatality rates of any viruses that people acquire from wild animals \u2013 including rabies, Ebola and the SARS coronavirus. Bats have a suite of antiviral defenses that keep the amount of virus in check. For example, some bats have an antiviral immune response called the interferon pathway perpetually switched on. In most other mammals, having such a hyper-vigilant immune response would cause harmful inflammation. Bats, however, have adapted anti-inflammatory traits that protect them from such harm, include the loss of certain genes that normally promote inflammation. However, no one has previously explored how these unique antiviral defenses of bats impact the viruses themselves. Now, Brook et al. have studied this exact question using bat cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments made use of cells from one bat species \u2013 the black flying fox \u2013 in which the interferon pathway is always on, and another \u2013 the Egyptian fruit bat \u2013 in which this pathway is only activated during an infection. The bat cells were infected with three different viruses, and then Brook et al. observed how the interferon pathway helped keep the infections in check, before creating a computer model of this response. The experiments and model helped reveal that the bats\u2019 defenses may have a potential downside for other animals, including humans. In both bat species, the strongest antiviral responses were countered by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell. This suggests that bat immune defenses may drive the evolution of faster transmitting viruses, and while bats are well protected from the harmful effects of their own prolific viruses, other creatures like humans are not. The findings may help to explain why bats are often the source for viruses that are deadly in humans. Learning more about bats' antiviral defenses and how they drive virus evolution may help scientists develop better ways to predict, prevent or limit the spread of viruses from bats to humans. More studies are needed in bats to help these efforts. In the meantime, the experiments highlight the importance of warning people to avoid direct contact with wild bats ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMammalian visual behaviors, as well as responses in the neural systems underlying these behaviors, are driven by luminance and color contrast. With constantly improving tools for measuring activity in cell-type-specific populations in the mouse during visual behavior, it is important to define the extent of luminance and color information that is behaviorally accessible to the mouse. A non-uniform distribution of cone opsins in the mouse retina potentially complicates both luminance and color sensitivity; opposing gradients of short ( UV-shifted ) and middle ( blue/green ) cone opsins suggest that color discrimination and wavelength-specific luminance contrast sensitivity may differ with retinotopic location. Here we ask how well mice can discriminate color and wavelength-specific luminance changes across visuotopic space. We found that mice were able to discriminate color and were able to do so more broadly across visuotopic space than expected from the cone-opsin distribution. We also found wavelength-band-specific differences in luminance sensitivity.  The mouse visual system is increasingly ( Baker, 2013; Priebe and McGee, 2014 ) being used as a model system for studying both cortical sensory processing ( Glickfeld et al., 2013, 2014; Niell and Stryker, 2008, 2010; Wang et al., 2011a ) and behavior ( Busse et al., 2011; Harvey et al., 2012; Histed et al., 2012; Hoy et al., 2016; Montijn et al., 2015 ). While most physiological work has used achromatic stimuli ( Durand et al., 2016; Niell and Stryker, 2008 ), mice, like most other mammals, display physiological color-opponent signals in the retina ( Baden et al., 2013; Baden et al., 2016; Breuninger et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2013; Joesch and Meister, 2016 ), through LGN ( Denman et al., 2017 ) and possibly V1 ( Tan et al., 2015 ). The mouse retina displays asymmetric and mixed expression of its two opsins along the dorsal-ventral axis of the retina, creating opposing gradients of short and middle opsins ( Applebury et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2011b ) and resulting in gradients of wavelength-band-specific responses ( Chang et al., 2013; Denman et al., 2017; Rhim et al., 2017 ). Therefore, the substrate for cone-driven color-opponent signals, and any color sensitivity, exists only in the overlapping \u2018opsin transition zone\u2019 ( Baden et al., 2013; Denman et al., 2017 ). However, short and middle opsin responses broadly overlap in V1 and higher visual areas ( Rhim et al., 2017 ) and rod-cone antagonism can also create color opponency in some mouse retinal ganglion cells ( Joesch and Meister, 2016 ), presenting the possibility that behaviorally\u00a0relevant color information could be extracted more broadly across retinotopic space. Whether mice can use color information to guide visual behavior is an open question. There is some evidence for color discrimination ( Jacobs et al., 2004 ), but it remains unclear how this depends on overall luminance, luminance contrast, or retinotopic position. Further, it is not known if the gradients in opsin distribution lead to variations in behavioral luminance sensitivity across space. Such non-uniformity would impact studies of visuotopically extended V1 populations, such as studies of population sparsity ( Froudarakis et al., 2014 ), population correlations ( Montijn et al., 2016a ) and other notions of population coding ( Montijn et al., 2015; Okun et al., 2015 ). Here, we use a simple behavior, change detection, to determine where in visual space mice can discriminate changes in chromaticity and luminance at ethologically-relevant mesopic ( 10\u22123 - 3 cd/m2, [Wyszecki and Stiles, 1982] ) luminance levels. By measuring detectability of luminance and color changes separately across elevation ( spanning\u00a0~75\u00b0 ), we are able to generate an estimate of wavelength-specific contrast sensitivity across visual space. Mice were able to discriminate color, but only at elevations above the horizon. We find both wavelength-specific luminance and color contrast sensitivity to be dependent on retinotopic location, but that these differences in sensitivity were less dramatic than expected from the cone opsin distribution, suggesting behavioral access to differential activation of rods and cones.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Color is a key part of our visual experience. Humans can distinguish between colors thanks to light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye called cones. Our eyes contain three types of cones, most simply named red, green and blue. When light enters the eye, it activates each cone type to a different degree. The combined activity of the three types of cone determines which color we see. However, in about 8% of men, one of the cone types is missing or faulty. This leads to color blindness, usually in the form of an inability to distinguish between reds and greens. Most other mammals can also see colors. This includes mice, which are used increasingly to study the mechanisms underlying vision. But it was not clear if mice also use color to guide their behavior. Mice have only two types of cones, some of which respond to green light and others to ultraviolet light. To complicate matters, the two types of cones are distributed unevenly across the back of the mouse eye. This suggests that mice may see colors differently in different parts of a visual scene. Denman et al. trained mice to lick a spout whenever they noticed a change in the color or brightness of a dot appearing at various locations on a screen. The results revealed that mice could detect changes in both color and brightness. But the mice's ability to do so depends on where the change occurs. In the upper part of the visual field, corresponding to the area above the horizon, mice could distinguish between different colors. In the lower part of the visual field, below the horizon, they could not. By contrast, mice were able to detect changes in brightness at many different locations. This information will make it easier to design and interpret experiments that use mice to try to understand how the brain generates vision. This should help scientists develop new treatments for disorders that affect vision, and possibly for many forms of cognitive impairment too ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nAlthough individuals of many species inexorably age, a number of observations established that the rate of aging is modulated in response to a variety of mild stresses. Here, we investigated how heat stress promotes longevity in yeast. We show that upon growth at higher temperature, yeast cells relax the retention of DNA circles, which act as aging factors in the mother cell. The enhanced frequency at which circles redistribute to daughter cells was not due to changes of anaphase duration or nuclear shape but solely to the downregulation of the diffusion barrier in the nuclear envelope. This effect depended on the PKA and Tor1 pathways, downstream of stress-response kinase Pkc1. Inhibition of these responses restored barrier function and circle retention and abrogated the effect of heat stress on longevity. Our data indicate that redistribution of aging factors from aged cells to their progeny can be a mechanism for modulating longevity.  Many cell types divide asymmetrically to generate a naive daughter cell that renews the division potential of the lineage, and a committed daughter cell that progresses toward differentiation and generally shows a limited division potential ( Knoblich, 2010; Chen et al., 2016; Ouellet and Barral, 2012 ). This is the case for many stem cells, which have the dual function of maintaining an eternal division potential and of generating differentiating daughters that eventually integrate themselves both structurally and functionally into organs ( Chen et al., 2016; Fisher and Sozzani, 2016 ). Accordingly, while the stem cell remains young during most of the lifespan of the individual, differentiating daughters age and need to be replaced over time. Current knowledge indicates that aging in metazoans follows a progressive loss of stem cells proliferation, and hence a loss in the regeneration potential of the organs ( Van Zant and Liang, 2003; Beerman and Rossi, 2015; Ahmed et al., 2017 ). However, how aging takes place at the cellular level is not well understood. Particularly, we do not yet understand how asymmetric division generates both one naive but rejuvenated and one committed but aging daughter cell. The unicellular fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model for studying this process ( Higuchi-Sanabria et al., 2014; Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014 ). Indeed, these cells proliferate through budding small, rejuvenated daughter cells from the surface of the larger, mother cell ( Mortimer and Johnston, 1959; Hartwell and Unger, 1977; Kennedy et al., 1994; Henderson and Gottschling, 2008 ). Strikingly, with each daughter produced, the mother cell ages and progressively loses its division potential until it eventually stops proliferating and dies. This process is called replicative aging and the replicative lifespan, that\u00a0is, the number of daughters a mother cell generates before dying, is limited, reaching about 25 generations in average for haploid wild-type cells ( Henderson and Gottschling, 2008; Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014 ). Beyond limiting the lifespan, yeast aging also manifests itself through a number of additional traits, such as the formation of protein aggregates ( Aguilaniu et al., 2003; Erjavec et al., 2007; Hill et al., 2014; Saarikangas and Barral, 2015 ), the neutralization of the vacuolar pH ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012; Henderson et al., 2014 ), the fractionation of mitochondrial organization ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012 ) and the decreased sensitivity of the cell to signaling pheromone ( Smeal et al., 1996;\u00a0Caudron and Barral, 2013; Schlissel et al., 2017 ) reviewed in Denoth Lippuner et al. ( 2014 ). In contrast, the daughter cells reset their vacuolar pH, mitochondrial organization, pheromone response and division potential. They then become mother cells themselves; they start budding-off daughters and aging. The progressive decline of cellular fitness with age is thought to be driven by the retention and accumulation of so-called aging factors in the mother cell. Three types of aging factors have been described. First, plasma-membrane proteins such as the proton-exporter Pma1 and several multi-drug transporters remain in the mother cell as it divides and contribute to its fitness decay ( Eldakak et al., 2010; Henderson et al., 2014; Thayer et al., 2014 ). Second, aging yeast mother cells also form a deposit that accumulates protein aggregates ( Aguilaniu et al., 2003; Erjavec et al., 2007; Hill et al., 2014; Saarikangas and Barral, 2015 ). Cells that fail to form this aggregate are long-lived ( Hill et al., 2014; Saarikangas and Barral, 2015 ). Third, intra-chromosomal recombination between repeated rDNA units excise extrachromosomal rDNA circles ( ERCs ) that segregate to and accumulate in the mother cell nucleus ( Szostak and Wu, 1980; Sinclair and Guarente, 1997; Shcheprova et al., 2008 ). Except for the endogenous two micron plasmid, ERCs and actually all DNA circles tested so far accumulate in the mother cell with age and accelerate aging ( Murray and Szostak, 1983; Falc\u00f3n and Aris, 2003 ). Old mother cells contain up to thousand ERCs and this load, which increases exponentially with successive divisions, might be what ultimately kills the cell ( Sinclair and Guarente, 1997 ). High-fidelity retention in the mother cell of the DNA circles and of the precursors of protein aggregation is facilitated by the formation of lateral diffusion barriers in the ER membrane and the outer nuclear membrane at the bud neck ( Luedeke et al., 2005; Shcheprova et al., 2008; Clay et al., 2014; Saarikangas et al., 2017 ). These barriers limit exchange of membrane-proteins between mother and bud. Therefore, retention of aging factors in the mother cell relies on their anchorage into the ER-membrane. Retention of the aggregation precursors relies on their membrane attachment through the farnesylated chaperone Ydj1 ( Saarikangas et al., 2017 ). DNA circles attach to the nuclear envelope through the SAGA complex and nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) ( Shcheprova et al., 2008; Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014 ). Remarkably, yeast cells show an extended life span when subjected to mild stresses such as calorie restriction and growth at 37\u00b0C ( Shama et al., 1998a;\u00a0Shama et al., 1998b;\u00a0Swieci\u0142o et al., 2000;\u00a0Kapahi et al., 2017 ). Similar effects take place in organisms as distinct as nematodes, flies and\u00a0mice, indicating that the regulation of longevity involves similar regulatory pathways in all these\u00a0organisms, at least upon calorie restriction, namely the TOR and PKA pathways ( Steinkraus et al., 2008;\u00a0Kapahi et al., 2010; Wasko and Kaeberlein, 2014 ). How these regulatory pathways actually modulate\u00a0ageing progression itself is largely unknown. The fact that yeast cells are able to modulate their longevity in response to environmental signals suggests that they have some control on the generation and accumulation of aging factors, or on the impact that these have on the physiology of the cell. We reasoned that one potential mechanism for increasing longevity could be the down-regulation of the retention of aging factors in the mother cell. Indeed, mutants affecting the retention of DNA circles in the mother cell are long-lived ( Shcheprova et al., 2008; Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014 ). Thus, we set here out to test whether physiological stresses affect the retention of aging factors in the mother cell, and how.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Aging is often an inevitable part of life. Yet, it seems like the aging process can be sped up or slowed down in organisms as distinct as fruit flies, mice and budding yeast in response to changes in the environment. Yeast, for example, lives 40% longer when grown at the elevated \u2013 and mildly stressful \u2013 temperature of 37\u00b0C instead of 30\u00b0C. But how can yeast, or any other organism, change its lifespan in response to stressful conditions ? Budding yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), as its name suggests, divides by budding small daughter cells from its surface. The mother cell gets older with each division, whereas the age of each daughter cell is reset to zero. The mother cell protects the daughters by keeping some harmful aging factors for itself. Many aging factors \u2013 like toxic DNA circles \u2013 are anchored to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum ( the compartment in the cell where many proteins are made ) and the nucleus ( the compartment where the cell's genetic information is stored ). Before the cells divide, a diffusion barrier keeps molecules in the membranes of the mother cell, preventing them from entering the membranes of the daughter cell. The aging factors only leak into the daughter cells if they detach from the membrane in the mother or if the diffusion barrier becomes permeable. The loss of aging factors causes the mother cell to live much longer than normal. Baldi, Bolognesi, Meinema et al. asked if something similar occurred when cells experience stress, which could explain why stressed yeast cells live longer. Indeed, mother cells did redistribute toxic DNA circles to their daughters when grown at a higher temperature. This did not happen because the DNA circles detached from the membrane. Instead the diffusion barrier became more permeable. Baldi et al. then went on to show that it was not just the heat that weakened the barrier. Rather the diffusion barrier was specifically down-regulated by one of the yeast\u2019s normal responses to stress. Lastly, when Baldi et al. took steps to make the diffusion barrier in mildly stressed cells less permeable again, the cells largely resumed aging like unstressed cells. Together these data suggest that yeast cells undergoing mild stress might not repair damage or clear out the aging factors but rather dispose of the factors by passing them on to their offspring. It is possible that this helps the population to cope with the stress, by sharing the burden of age \u2013 or, as Baldi et al. also discuss, the wisdom of age \u2013 with the other individuals. Stress-response pathways are conserved among many other organisms, and similar diffusion barriers occur in worms and mammals too. Thus, this newly discovered process might also happen in other cells that divide asymmetrically, including human stem cells ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe mechanism of transport through the Golgi complex is not completely understood, insofar as no single transport mechanism appears to account for all of the observations. Here, we compare the transport of soluble secretory proteins ( albumin and \u03b11-antitrypsin ) with that of supramolecular cargoes ( e. g., procollagen ) that are proposed to traverse the Golgi by compartment progression\u2013maturation. We show that these soluble proteins traverse the Golgi much faster than procollagen while moving through the same stack. Moreover, we present kinetic and morphological observations that indicate that albumin transport occurs by diffusion via intercisternal continuities. These data provide evidence for a transport mechanism that applies to a major class of secretory proteins and indicate the co-existence of multiple intra-Golgi trafficking modes.  Nearly one third of the eukaryotic proteins are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and then transported to their cellular destinations through the secretory pathway. Over the years, the general organization of membrane transport along the secretory pathway has been gradually unraveled ( Mellman and Simons, 1992; Mellman and Warren, 2000 ), and many of the underlying molecular components have been identified ( Rothman, 2002; Schekman, 2002; Emr et al., 2009 ). Some key questions, however, remain unresolved ( Pfeffer, 2007; Emr et al., 2009; Glick and Luini, 2011 ). A central issue is how cargo proteins traverse the Golgi complex ( Malhotra et al., 1989; Glick and Malhotra, 1998; Glick and Luini, 2011 ), a major transport station composed of stacks of flat membranous cisternae. There are three main anterograde transport mechanisms that are in principle possible and might apply to the Golgi: ( a ) transport by compartment progression\u2013maturation; ( b ) transport by dissociative anterograde vesicular carriers and, ( c ) transport via inter-compartment continuities. Among these, the progression\u2013maturation model has gained a degree of consensus as an intra-Golgi traffic mechanism, based on several lines of evidence in mammals ( Bonfanti et al., 1998; Lanoix et al., 2001; Martinez-Menarguez et al., 2001; Mironov et al., 2001; Rizzo et al., 2013 ), yeast ( Losev et al., 2006; Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006; Rivera-Molina and Novick, 2009 ), algae ( Becker et al., 1995 ), and plants ( Donohoe et al., 2013 ). Under this model, cargo molecules remain in the lumen of the Golgi cisternae while the cisternae themselves progress through the stack and \u2018mature\u2019 through recycling of their resident enzymes. Recently, cisternal progression has been proposed to apply only to the rims ( and not to the core ) of the cisternae in the mammalian Golgi ( Lavieu et al., 2013 ). In addition to the Golgi, the progression\u2013maturation principle appears to be involved in the endocytic ( Rink et al., 2005; Poteryaev et al., 2010 ) and the phagocytic pathways ( Fairn and Grinstein, 2012 ) in different species. The vesicular transport mechanism, whereby dissociative carriers transport cargoes between successive compartments, operates at many stages of the trafficking pathway and has been proposed to apply also to intra-Golgi trafficking ( Rothman, 2002 ). Here, however, the evidence is less direct and less conclusive than at other transport segments, with conflicting claims about the presence ( Orci et al., 2000 ) or absence ( Claude, 1970; Sabesin and Frase, 1977; Severs and Hicks, 1979; Clermont et al., 1993; Dahan et al., 1994; Di Lazzaro et al., 1995; Bonfanti et al., 1998; Orci et al., 2000; Martinez-Menarguez et al., 2001; Mironov et al., 2001; Gilchrist et al., 2006 ) of anterograde cargo proteins in the peri-Golgi carriers. Moreover in particular cases, like in microsporidia, intra-Golgi transport appears to occur without COPI vesicles ( Beznoussenko et al., 2007 ). Diffusion-based transport via inter-compartment continuities remains the least explored and understood of the traffic mechanisms. Some antecedents, however, are available. Continuity-mediated transport has been observed to occur between endosomes and lysosomes ( Luzio et al., 2007 ), and also the exocytic release of cargo from secretory granules ( Rutter and Hill, 2006 ) or synaptic vesicles through transient pores ( kiss-and-run ) ( Rizzoli and Jahn, 2007; Alabi and Tsien, 2013 ) at the plasma membrane can be considered to occur via this modality. For intra-Golgi transport, this mechanism has been discussed several times in the past ( Mellman and Simons, 1992; Weidman, 1995; Mironov et al., 1997; Marsh et al., 2004; Trucco et al., 2004; Mironov et al., 2005; Beznoussenko et al., 2007; Glick and Luini, 2011 ) and a few recent intra-Golgi transport models including the mixing\u2013partitioning ( Patterson et al., 2008 ), the kiss-and-run ( Mironov and Beznoussenko, 2012; Fusella et al., 2013; Mironov et al., 2013 ) and the cisternal progenitor schemes ( Pfeffer, 2010 ) have been proposed that imply transient tubular continuities across cisternae. At the molecular/mechanistic level, Golgi tubule formation has been proposed to be initiated by COPI coatomer-mediated budding ( Yang et al., 2011 ), and tubule elongation and fission appear to require the actions of cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2 ) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase-\u03b3 ( LPAAT\u03b3 ), respectively ( San Pietro et al., 2009 ) ( Yang et al., 2011 ). Recent evidence also points to a role for Golgi localized SNAREs and BARS in the dynamics of the intercisternal connections ( Fusella et al., 2013 ). Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the molecular players regulating the intra-Golgi connections remains lacking. Altogether, uncertainties remain about the applicability of continuity-based transport to the Golgi. One main reason for this situation has been the long-standing difficulty of demonstrating intercisternal continuities in thin sections for electron microscopy. This obstacle has now been partly overcome by the use of electron tomography and new methods of three dimensional electron microscopy ( Briggman and Bock, 2012 ), which have revealed the presence of intercisternal tubular continuities under experimental conditions that favor the detection of these tubules, such as the induction of active trafficking ( Marsh et al., 2004; Trucco et al., 2004; Vivero-Salmeron et al., 2008; San Pietro et al., 2009; Wanner et al., 2013 ). The second and main problem, yet to be resolved, is that the mere presence of intercisternal tubules is insufficient to prove a role for these continuities in transport, as these tubules might be too few and unfavorably disposed to support trafficking. To test the continuity-based transport model, it is thus necessary to search for functional evidence of a transport role for these continuities. To this end, we have used soluble secretory proteins as transport markers, as these are globular objects of a few nm in diameter that should easily cross the observed intercisternal tubules and rapidly move from the cis to the trans face of an interconnected stack or ribbon. The transport of some soluble proteins has been studied decades ago using electron microscopic autoradiography ( Caro and Palade, 1964; Jamieson and Palade, 1967; Ashley and Peters, 1969; Castle et al., 1972 ) and biochemical pulse-chase assays ( Jamieson and Palade, 1967; Lodish et al., 1983 ), but their actual mechanism of secretion remains unknown. Comparing the trafficking pattern of prototypic soluble proteins with those of cargoes previously proposed to move by cisternal progression\u2013maturation, we find that soluble proteins cross the Golgi stack at a much faster rate, apparently by diffusion along intercisternal connections; and that this transport mode coexists in the same Golgi complex with the much slower intra-Golgi progression of large, non-diffusible cargo, such as procollagen I ( PC-I ). Soluble secreted proteins are of great physiological interest because they represent a significant portion ( possibly more than 10% ) of the mammalian proteome and include hormones, growth factors, serum proteins, antibodies, and digestive enzymes. Thus, these results are consistent with a novel mechanism of transport for a major class of secretory proteins, and provide evidence for multiplicity of transport mechanisms that can help to rationalize most of the observed intra-Golgi trafficking patterns.

Each Golgi is made from a stack of flattened sacs called cisternae that are filled with fluid and enclosed by a membrane. Proteins and other molecules are transported to the Golgi by packages called vesicles, which fuse with the outermost cisterna, which is known as the \u2018cis-face\u2019 of the Golgi, and unload their contents. From here, the proteins are processed and modified by enzymes as they move through the Golgi towards the \u2018trans-face\u2019 on the opposite side. The modified proteins are then re-packaged into vesicles before being sent to their intended destinations. But how do proteins move through the Golgi ? Some researchers have suggested that proteins do not actually move: rather, the stacks of the Golgi move like a conveyer belt as new cisterna are added to the cis-face. However, other researchers have proposed that molecules proceed from one cisterna to the next inside small vesicles. It is also possible that proteins are transported through the Golgi in other ways, or by a combination of two or more methods. Now, Beznoussenko, Parashuraman et al. reveal that some small, soluble, proteins can move through the Golgi by diffusion. These proteins move much quicker than large protein complexes, which suggests that multiple transport mechanisms do co-exist within the Golgi. Furthermore, Beznoussenko, Parashuraman et al. found that these soluble proteins are most likely moving through some narrow tunnel-like connections between the individual cisternae. Following on from the work of Beznoussenko, Parashuraman et al., the main challenge is to understand how all the different types of proteins that move through the Golgi are transported\u2014which includes roughly a third of all human proteins. As many of these proteins are important for human health, learning to control their transport might create new opportunities to understand and treat disease ."}

But, how exactly tumors arise from a few malignant cells within an intact epithelium is a central, yet unanswered question. This is mainly due to the inaccessibility of this process to longitudinal imaging together with a lack of systems that model the progression of a fraction of transformed cells within a tissue. Here, we developed a new methodology based on primary mouse mammary epithelial acini, where oncogenes can be switched on in single cells within an otherwise normal epithelial cell layer. We combine this stochastic breast tumor induction model with inverted light-sheet imaging to study single-cell behavior for up to four days and analyze cell fates utilizing a newly developed image-data analysis workflow. The power of this integrated approach is illustrated by us finding that small local clusters of transformed cells form tumors while isolated transformed cells do not.  Organoid cultures grown from cell-lines or primary cells have been successfully employed to study molecular mechanisms during different stages of tumorigenesis ( Clevers, 2016; Havas et al., 2017; Simian and Bissell, 2017 ). However, they are derived from primary material that usually allows oncogenic activation in all cells of the tissue and therefore cannot reproduce the localized expansion at a defined part of the tissue that is seen in the patient situation. To study tumor initiation, models need to be established wherein only a few tumorigenic cells expand in the context of its immediate non-tumor microenvironment ( Tabassum and Polyak, 2015 ) and the interplay of these populations can be visualized. Long-term imaging of primary organoids has been achieved via light-sheet microscopy ( Drost et al., 2015; Serra et al., 2019; Verissimo et al., 2016 ) and these efforts have benefited from the lower phototoxicity provided by SPIM imaging. However, regarding fast dividing cells in tumor organoids, tracking single-cell dynamics necessitates high resolution imaging which in turn limits the time frame in which organoids can be imaged without phototoxic effects ( Held et al., 2018 ). Conversely, imaging primary organoids for longer time periods requires an offset of temporal and cellular resolution that eventually cannot allow single-cell fate tracking ( Dekkers et al., 2016 ). Two models have been used to understand tumor progression and heterogeneity ( Plaks et al., 2015 ) ; the ( i ) hierarchical model refers to tumor propagating cells as cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) ( Kreso and Dick, 2014 ) and the ( ii ) stochastic model states that every cell within a tumor is equally likely to be the cell of origin and facilitate tumor initiation and progression ( Vogelstein et al., 1988; Williams et al., 2007 ). These models for tumor propagation can be reconciled when considering that the population of oncogene driven cells have the capacity to interconvert between differentiated- and stem-like states ( Chaffer and Weinberg, 2015; Gupta et al., 2011; Plaks et al., 2015 ), a flexibility that is supported by the microenvironment ( McGovern et al., 2009; Quail et al., 2012 ). These concepts, however, have not been probed in the context of tumor initiation upon stochastic oncogene activation in an established cell-layer. Here we present a novel model of breast tumorigenesis where only single cells express oncogenes within healthy mammary acini and are able to establish localized outgrowth. We thereby overcome the above-mentioned limitations of studying tumorigenesis events in the face of tissue-wide transformation. Furthermore, we perform long-term imaging of these stochastic breast tumor acini for the first time at a temporal resolution that allows us to follow single-cell fates. We also integrate this approach with an image analysis pipeline capable of segmenting cells in their dynamic progression towards tumorigenesis, so they can be tracked individually over time.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: There are now drugs to treat many types of cancer, but questions still remain around how these diseases start in the first place. Researchers think that tumor growth begins when a single cell suffers damage to certain sites in its DNA that eventually cause it to divide uncontrollably. That damaged cell, and its descendants, go on to form a lump, or tumor. The trouble with proving this theory is that it is hard to watch it happening in real time. Doctors usually only meet people with cancer when their tumors start to cause health problems. By this point, the tumors contain millions of cells. A way to watch the very beginnings of a cancer could reveal risk factors within a tissue that foster the growth of a tumor. But first, researchers need to test their theory about how the disease begins in the first place. One way to do this is to surround a single cancer cell with healthy cells and watch what happens next. To do this, Alladin, Chaible et al. took healthy cells from the breast tissue of mice and grew them in the laboratory into mini-organs called organoids. These organoids share a lot of features with actual mouse breast tissue; they can even make milk if given the right hormones. Once the organoids were ready, Alladin, Chaible et al then started modifying a small number of single cells inside them by switching on genes called oncogenes, which are known to drive cancer formation in humans. Using fluorescent proteins and a sheet of laser light it was possible to watch what happened to the cells over time. This revealed that, even though all the oncogene-driven single cells received the same signals, not all of them started to divide uncontrollably. In fact, a single modified cell had a low chance of forming a tumor on its own. The more oncogene-driven cells there were near to each other, the more likely they were to form tumors. Alladin, Chaible et al. think that this is because the healthy tissue interacts with the modified, oncogene-driven cells to suppress tumor formation. It is only when a larger number of modified cells group together and start to communicate with each other that they can override the inhibitory messages of the healthy tissue. How healthy tissue stops single modified cells from forming tumors is not yet clear. But, with this new mini-organ system, researchers now have the tools to investigate. In the future, this could lead to new strategies to stop cancer before it has a chance to get started ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nWe make choices based on the values of expected outcomes, informed by previous experience in similar settings. When the outcomes of our decisions consistently violate expectations, new learning is needed to maximize rewards. Yet not every surprising event indicates a meaningful change in the environment. Even when conditions are stable overall, outcomes of a single experience can still be unpredictable due to small fluctuations ( i. e., expected uncertainty ) in reward or costs. In the present work, we investigate causal contributions of the basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) and orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) in rats to learning under expected outcome uncertainty in a novel delay-based task that incorporates both predictable fluctuations and directional shifts in outcome values. We demonstrate that OFC is required to accurately represent the distribution of wait times to stabilize choice preferences despite trial-by-trial fluctuations in outcomes, whereas BLA is necessary for the facilitation of learning in response to surprising events.  Learning to predict rewards is a remarkable evolutionary adaptation that supports flexible behavior in complex and unstable environments. When circumstances change, previously-acquired knowledge may no longer be informative and the behavior needs to be adapted to benefit from novel opportunities. Frequently, alterations in environmental conditions are not signaled by external cues and can only be inferred from deviations from anticipated outcomes, that\u00a0is, surprise signals. When making decisions, humans typically attempt to maximize benefits ( i. e., amount of reward ) received per invested resource ( i. e., money, time, physical or cognitive effort ). We, like many other animals, compute economic value that takes into account rewards and costs associated with available behavioral options and choose the alternative that is expected to result in outcomes of the highest value based on previous experiences under similar conditions ( Padoa-Schioppa and Schoenbaum, 2015; Sugrue et al., 2005 ). When the outcomes of choices consistently violate expectations, new learning is needed to maximize reward procurement. However, not every unexpected outcome is caused by meaningful changes in the environment. Even when conditions are stable overall, outcomes of a single experience can still be unpredictable due to small fluctuations ( i. e., expected uncertainty ) in reward and costs. Such fluctuations complicate surprise-driven learning since animals need to distinguish between true changes in the environment from stochastic feedback under otherwise stable conditions, known as the problem of change-point detection ( Courville et al., 2006; Dayan et al., 2000; Gallistel et al., 2001; Pearce and Hall, 1980; Yu and Dayan, 2005 ). Both the basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) and orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) participate in flexible reward-directed behavior. Representations of expected outcomes can be decoded from both brain regions during value-based decision making ( Conen and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015; Haruno et al., 2014; Padoa-Schioppa, 2007, 2009; Salzman et al., 2007; van Duuren et al., 2009 ). Amygdala lesions render animals unable to adaptively track changes in reward availability or benefit from profitable periods in the environment ( Murray and Izquierdo, 2007; Salinas et al., 1996; Salzman et al., 2007 ). Furthermore, a recent evaluation of the accumulated literature on BLA in appetitive behavior suggests that this region integrates both current reward value and long-term history information ( Wassum and Izquierdo, 2015 ), and therefore may be particularly well-suited to guide behavior when conditions change. Importantly, single-unit responses in BLA track surprise signals ( Roesch et al., 2010 ) that can drive learning. Similarly, a functionally-intact OFC is required for adaptive responses to changes in outcome values ( Elliott et al., 2000; Izquierdo and Murray, 2010; Murray and Izquierdo, 2007 ). Impairments produced by OFC lesions have been widely attributed to diminished cognitive flexibility or inhibitory control deficits ( Bari and Robbins, 2013; Dalley et al., 2004; Elliott and Deakin, 2005; Winstanley, 2007 ). However, this view has been challenged recently by observations that selective medial OFC lesions cause potentiated switching between different option alternatives, rather than a failure to disengage from previously acquired behavior ( Walton et al., 2010, 2011 ). Indeed, there is increasing evidence that certain sectors of OFC may not exert a canonical inhibitory control over action, but may instead contribute outcome representations predicted by specific cues in the environment and update expectations in response to surprising feedback ( Izquierdo et al., 2017; Marquardt et al., 2017; Riceberg and Shapiro, 2012, 2017; Rudebeck and Murray, 2014; Stalnaker et al., 2015 ). Despite important contributions of both the BLA and OFC to several forms of adaptive value learning, some learning tasks progress normally without the recruitment of these brain regions. For example, the OFC is not required for acquisition of simple stimulus-outcome associations, both in Pavlovian and instrumental context, or for unblocking driven by differences in value when outcomes are certain and predictable. However, the OFC is needed for adaptive behavior that requires integration of information from different sources, particularly when current outcomes need to be compared with a history in a different context ( or state ) as in devaluation paradigms ( Izquierdo et al., 2004; McDannald et al., 2011, 2005; Stalnaker et al., 2015 ). Similarly, as has been shown in rats, BLA has an important role in early learning or decision making under ambiguous outcomes ( Hart and Izquierdo, 2017; Ostrander et al., 2011 ), and seems to play a limited role in choice behavior when these outcomes are known or reinforced through extended training. These observations hint at important roles for BLA and OFC in learning under conditions of uncertainty. Yet little is known about unique contributions of these brain regions to value learning when outcomes are fluctuating even under stable conditions ( i. e., when there is expected uncertainty in outcome values ). Furthermore, the functional dissociation between different OFC subregions ( e. g. ventromedial vs. lateral ) is presently debated ( Dalton et al., 2016; Elliott et al., 2000; Morris et al., 2016 ). Recently-developed computational models based on reinforcement learning ( RL ) ( Diederen and Schultz, 2015; Khamassi et al., 2011; Preuschoff and Bossaerts, 2007 ) and Bayesian inference principles ( Behrens et al., 2007; Nassar et al., 2010 ) are well suited to test for unique contributions of different brain regions to value learning under uncertainty. These models rely on learning in response to surprise, or the deviation between expected and observed outcomes ( i. e., reward prediction errors, RPEs ) ; the learning rate, in turn, determines the degree to which prediction errors affect value estimates. Importantly, the RL principles do not only account for animal behavior, but are also reflected in underlying neuronal activity ( Lee et al., 2012; Niv et al., 2015 ). In the present work, we first developed a novel delay-based behavioral paradigm to investigate the effects of expected outcome uncertainty on learning in rats. We demonstrated that rats can detect true changes in outcome values even when they occur against a background of stochastic feedback. Such behavioral complexity in rodents allowed us to assess causal contributions of the BLA and OFC to value learning under expected outcome uncertainty. Specifically, we examined the neuroadaptations that occur in these brain regions in response to experience with different levels of environmental uncertainty and employed fine-grained behavioral analyses partnered with computational modeling of trial-by-trial performance of OFC- and BLA-lesioned animals on our task that incorporates both predictable fluctuations and directional shifts in outcome values.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Nobody likes waiting \u2013 we opt for online shopping to avoid standing in lines, grow impatient in traffic, and often prefer restaurants that serve food quickly. When making decisions, humans and other animals try to maximize the benefits by weighing up the costs and rewards associated with a situation. Many regions in the brain help us choose the best options based on quality and size of rewards, and required waiting times. Even before we make decisions, the activity in these brain regions predicts what we will choose. Sometimes, however, unexpected changes can lead to longer waiting times and our preferences suddenly become less desirable. The brain can detect such changes by comparing the outcomes we anticipate to those we experience. When the outcomes are surprising, specific areas in the brain such as the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex help us learn to make better choices. However, as surprising events can occur purely by chance, we need to be able to ignore irrelevant surprises and only learn from meaningful ones. Until now, it was not clear whether the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex play specific roles in successfully learning under such conditions. Stolyarova and Izquierdo trained rats to select between two images and rewarded them with sugar pellets after different delays. If rats chose one of these images they received the rewards after a predictable delay that was about 10 seconds, while choosing the other one produced variable delays \u2013 sometimes the time intervals were either very short or very long. Then, the waiting times for one of the alternatives changed unexpectedly. Rats with healthy brains quickly learned to choose the option with the shorter waiting time. Stolyarova and Izquierdo repeated the experiments with rats that had damage in a part of the amygdala. These rats learned more slowly, particularly when the variable option changed for the better. Rats with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex failed to learn at all. Stolyarova and Izquierdo then examined the rats\u2019 behavior during delays. Rats with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex could not distinguish between meaningful and irrelevant surprises and always looked for the food pellet ( i. e. anticipated a reward ) at the average delay interval. These findings highlight two brain regions that help us distinguish meaningful surprises from irrelevant ones. A next step will be to examine how the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex interact during learning and see if changes to the activity of these brain regions may affect responses. Advanced methods to non-invasively manipulate brain activity in humans may help people who find it hard to cope with changes; or individuals suffering from substance use disorders, who often struggle to give up drugs that provide them immediate and predictable rewards ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nSynaptic transmission from Drosophila photoreceptors to lamina neurons requires recycling of histamine neurotransmitter. Synaptic histamine is cleared by uptake into glia and conversion into carcinine, which functions as transport metabolite. How carcinine is transported from glia to photoreceptor neurons remains unclear. In a targeted RNAi screen for genes involved in this pathway, we identified carT, which encodes a member of the SLC22A transporter family. CarT expression in photoreceptors is necessary and sufficient for fly vision and behavior. Carcinine accumulates in the lamina of carT flies. Wild-type levels are restored by photoreceptor-specific expression of CarT, and endogenous tagging suggests CarT localizes to synaptic endings. Heterologous expression of CarT in S2 cells is sufficient for carcinine uptake, demonstrating the ability of CarT to utilize carcinine as a transport substrate. Together, our results demonstrate that CarT transports the histamine metabolite carcinine into photoreceptor neurons, thus contributing an essential step to the histamine\u2013carcinine cycle.  Histaminergic neurotransmission plays an important role in a variety of mammalian and invertebrate behavioral processes and contributes to the regulation of arousal, sleep and circadian rhythms ( Nall and Sehgal, 2014; Panula and Nuutinen, 2013 ). Defects in histaminergic signaling are linked to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, depression and Tourette\u2019s syndrome ( Panula and Nuutinen, 2013; Shan et al., 2015; Castellan Baldan et al., 2014 ). Synaptic clearance and recycling of monoamine neurotransmitters, including serotonin and dopamine, depend on transporters that promote uptake into the\u00a0presynaptic terminals or the\u00a0surrounding glia ( Torres and Amara, 2007 ). For histamine, such transporter activities have been documented in mammalian and invertebrate glia ( Yoshikawa et al., 2013; Edwards and Meinertzhagen, 2010 ). In the Drosophila visual system, histidine decarboxylase ( Hdc ) generates histamine in photoreceptor neurons ( Burg et al., 1993 ). Light-induced depolarization of these neurons ( Wang and Montell, 2007 ) promotes synaptic release of histamine, which opens histamine-gated chloride channels on postsynaptic L1 and L2 lamina neurons, triggering their hyperpolarization ( Pantazis et al., 2008 ). These postsynaptic voltage changes can be followed with electroretinograms ( ERGs ) that reveal ON and OFF transient peaks coinciding with initiation and cessation of the light source ( Alawi and Pak, 1971; Heisenberg, 1971 ). In addition to identifying mutants that interfere with presynaptic release ( Kim et al., 2012 ), this phenotype has also contributed to the genetic dissection of histamine recycling ( Edwards and Meinertzhagen, 2010 ). Synaptic histamine is taken up into epithelial glia that completely envelope photoreceptor synapses ( Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991 ). Within these glia, histamine is modified by the Ebony-catalyzed condensation with \u03b2-alanine ( Richardt et al., 2002; Borycz et al., 2002; Hartwig et al., 2014; Richardt et al., 2003 ). The reaction product carcinine is transferred to photoreceptors, which recover histamine by Tan-catalyzed hydrolysis ( Borycz et al., 2002; True et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2007 ). This histamine\u2013carcinine cycle ( see below: Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ), reminiscent of the glutamate\u2013glutamine cycle in the mammalian brain ( Br\u00f6er and Brookes, 2001 ), is necessary to maintain visual neurotransmission ( Borycz et al., 2005 ) and depends on the compartmentalization of glial Ebony and neuronal Tan ( Stuart et al., 2007 ). Mutants for ebony or tan lack ON and OFF transients ( Heisenberg, 1971; Hotta and Benzer, 1969; Chaturvedi et al., 2014 ), indicating that neither histamine synthesis in photoreceptor neurons by Hdc nor a putative direct re-uptake mechanism is sufficient to sustain neurotransmitter release at photoreceptor synapses ( Ziegler et al., 2013 ). The identity of the transporters that facilitate glial uptake of histamine from the synaptic cleft and transport of its metabolite, carcinine, out of glia and into photoreceptor neurons remains a long-standing mystery, ( Edwards and Meinertzhagen, 2010; Stuart et al., 2007; Romero-Calder\u00f3n et al., 2007; 2008 ). Here, we show that the previously uncharacterized CG9317 gene, that we named carT, encodes a transporter responsible for uptake of carcinine into photoreceptor neurons. We demonstrate that CarT activity is a prerequisite for visual neurotransduction.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Photoreceptors are light-sensitive neurons in the eyes of the fruit fly Drosophila that form connections with other neurons in the fly\u2019s brain. At these connections, which are called synapses, the photoreceptors continuously release a chemical called histamine. Photoreceptors will release more or less histamine depending on changes in light intensity, but always tend to release more histamine than they can produce themselves from scratch. This means that the visual system in Drosophila relies on a pathway that recycles histamine. That is to say, glial cells ( which support the activity of the neurons ) remove the chemical from synapses and return it to the photoreceptor neurons in a slightly modified form called \u201ccarcinine\u201d. The photoreceptors then quickly convert the chemical back into histamine, ready to be released. Stenesen et al. set out to identify the proteins that support this recycling pathway, and started by screening around 130 genes that encode transporter proteins for potential roles in histamine recycling. This screen identified a gene encoding a protein that was named CarT. This protein transports carcinine, the modified version of the histamine neurotransmitter. Stenesen et al. show that the photoreceptor neurons make the CarT protein and need this protein to take up the carcinine released by the supporting glial cells. Without CarT, photoreceptor neurons cannot transmit visual information, and so mutant flies in which the gene for CarT is deleted are blind. Follow-up studies related to this work could involve identifying the transporters that move histamine and carcinine in and out of the glia cells, and exploring what other neurons and behaviors in fruit flies rely on CarT\u2019s activity ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nHitherto, membralin has been a protein of unknown function. Here, we show that membralin mutant mice manifest a severe and early-onset motor neuron disease in an autosomal recessive manner, dying by postnatal day 5\u20136. Selective death of lower motor neurons, including those innervating the limbs, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm, is predominantly responsible for this fatal phenotype. Neural expression of a membralin transgene completely rescues membralin mutant mice. Mechanistically, we show that membralin interacts with Erlin2, an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane protein that is located in lipid rafts and known to be important in ER-associated protein degradation ( ERAD ). Accordingly, the degradation rate of ERAD substrates is attenuated in cells lacking membralin. Membralin mutations or deficiency in mouse models induces ER stress, rendering neurons more vulnerable to cell death. Our study reveals a critical role of membralin in motor neuron survival and suggests a novel mechanism for early-onset motor neuron disease.  The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a membrane-enclosed cellular organelle that plays an essential role in the folding of membrane-bound and secreted proteins, synthesis of lipids and sterols, and storage of free Ca2+. ER stress is often triggered by the accumulation of unfolded proteins due to pathological conditions, such as DNA sequence mutations, transcriptional and translational errors, or protein folding failure ( Kim et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008 ). Mammalian cells have evolved an intricate system with multiple signaling pathways to respond to ER stress, collectively termed the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) ( Kim et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008; Walter and Ron, 2011 ). If unchecked, ER stress eventually causes cell death, including neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases ( Lindholm et al., 2006; Scheper and Hoozemans, 2009; Hetz and Mollereau, 2014 ). Increased ER stress is thought to play an early role in motor neuron diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth ( CMT ) ( Atkin et al., 2006; Nagata et al., 2007; Nishitoh et al., 2008; Kanekura et al., 2009; Saxena et al., 2009 ). Manifestations and consequences of ER stress have been studied in the pathogenesis of SOD1 mutant mice, a commonly used model of ALS that expresses mutant human SOD1 protein as found in some inherited forms of ALS ( Atkin et al., 2006; Kanekura et al., 2009; Saxena et al., 2009 ). Many ER stress-related molecules are upregulated in SOD1 mice at an early stage of the disease, and some are specific to motor neurons ( Tobisawa et al., 2003; Atkin et al., 2006; Kikuchi et al., 2006; Nagata et al., 2007; Ito et al., 2009; Saxena et al., 2009 ). In addition, reduction in the ER co-chaperone SIL1 has been found to be associated specifically with ER stress-prone, fast-fatigable motor neurons ( Filezac de L'Etang et al., 2015 ). ER upregulation of the UPR and aberrant modification of protein disulfide isomerase ( PDI ) also occur in human tissues from sporadic ALS ( Atkin et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2010 ). Our studies on the activation of the type I interferon signaling in astrocytes at pre-symptomatic stages of SOD1 mice also suggest that ER stress in motor neurons may play a crucial role in disease onset ( Wang et al., 2011 ). Moreover, genetic interruption of UPR signaling molecules, such as XBP-1 or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1 ( ASK1 ), protects motor neurons in SOD1 mutant mice ( Nishitoh et al., 2008; Hetz and Mollereau, 2014 ). It has been suggested that the unusually heavy metabolic demand of motor neurons may make them particularly susceptible to ER stress ( Vinay et al., 2000; Carrascal et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005 ). Importantly, ER stress inhibitors, such as salubrinal, guanabenz, and sphin1, delay disease onset and prolong the survival of these mutant mice ( Saxena et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Das et al., 2015 ). This finding suggests that ER stress-related molecules may represent rational drug targets for motor neuron diseases. Previously, membralin had been predicted by genome sequencing to encompass an open reading frame ( orf61 in mouse and c19orf6 in human ), but the function of the encoded protein has, heretofore, remained unknown. Orf61 is highly conserved and found in the genome of most species except yeast and bacteria. cDNAs for membralin have been cloned from human and mouse tissues ( Andersson and von Euler, 2002; Chen et al., 2005 ), and the protein encoded by orf61 was named membralin because it was predicted to be a membrane protein ( Andersson and von Euler, 2002 ). Given the absence of known protein domains, membralin may represent a novel class of proteins. Here, we discovered during our cloning and characterization of the glutamate receptor subunit 3B gene ( GluN3B, formerly designated NR3B, Nishi et al., 2001; Chatterton et al., 2002; Matsuda et al., 2002 ) that the 3\u2032 end of the GluN3B gene overlaps with the 3\u2032 end of the membralin gene on the opposite strand. Thus, our GluN3B knockout ( KO ) mice also carry a C-terminal truncation of membralin. We observed that GluN3B/membralin C-terminal double-knockout ( DKO ) mice die at postnatal day 5\u20136 of paresis due to severe motor neuron degeneration. Transgenic expression of membralin, but not GluN3B, rescued the phenotypes of DKO mice. Additionally, we generated membralin-specific KO mice and found that they phenocopied the DKO mice. These data suggest that membralin plays a critical role in motor neuron survival. We also demonstrate that membralin interacts with Erlin2, a protein that is enriched in ER lipid rafts and important for ER-associated protein degradation ( ERAD ) ( Ikegawa et al., 1999; Browman et al., 2006 ). Additionally, neurons from membralin mutant mice display increased basal ER stress and increased vulnerability to ER stress-inducing agents. Our discovery that membralin mutations result in motor neuron disease provides mechanistic insight into pathophysiology and may offer a novel target for therapy.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: As new proteins are built inside a cell, many will pass into a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum for processing. There, the proteins are folded into the specific three-dimensional shapes that allow them to carry out their respective jobs. Sometimes the folding process goes awry, leading to a build-up of unfolded proteins that stress the endoplasmic reticulum and can kill the cell. Brain cells are particularly vulnerable to death from endoplasmic reticulum stress. To combat a deadly build-up of unfolded proteins, each cell has systems that respond when the endoplasmic reticulum is under stress. Unchecked stress on the endoplasmic reticulum has been linked to diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( called ALS for short ). In diseases like ALS, the nerve cells that control muscle movements gradually die off, causing a loss of muscle control and eventually death. Scientists suspect that these nerve cells ( called motor neurons ) are particularly sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress because they are highly active. Drugs that help counteract stress on the endoplasmic reticulum extend the lives of mice with motor neuron disease, suggesting this may be a useful strategy for treating such diseases in humans. Now, Yang, Qu et al. identify a new protein that appears necessary for a healthy endoplasmic reticulum. Mice that lack the gene for a protein called membralin die within five or six days after birth because their motor neurons die off. Further experiments showed that re-introducing membralin in their nervous system can rescue these membralin-deficient mice. Yang, Qu et al. found that membralin interacts with another protein that helps eliminate poorly folded or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, and thus relieves stress on the cell. Mutations in this endoplasmic reticulum stress response protein have previously been linked to motor neuron diseases. The motor neurons in membralin-deficient mice show signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and are extra vulnerable to chemicals that induce protein misfolding. Together, the experiments show membralin plays an important role in mitigating stress on the endoplasmic reticulum. More studies of mice lacking membralin may help explain why the endoplasmic reticulum stress increases in motor neuron diseases and may point to possible treatments ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nA guiding principle in self-assembly is that, for high production yield, nucleation of structures must be significantly slower than their growth. However, details of the mechanism that impedes nucleation are broadly considered irrelevant. Here, we analyze self-assembly into finite-sized target structures employing mathematical modeling. We investigate two key scenarios to delay nucleation: ( i ) by introducing a slow activation step for the assembling constituents and, ( ii ) by decreasing the dimerization rate. These scenarios have widely different characteristics. While the dimerization scenario exhibits robust behavior, the activation scenario is highly sensitive to demographic fluctuations. These demographic fluctuations ultimately disfavor growth compared to nucleation and can suppress yield completely. The occurrence of this stochastic yield catastrophe does not depend on model details but is generic as soon as number fluctuations between constituents are taken into account. On a broader perspective, our results reveal that stochasticity is an important limiting factor for self-assembly and that the specific implementation of the nucleation process plays a significant role in determining the yield.  We model the assembly of a fixed number of well-defined target structures from limited resources. Specifically, we consider a set of S different species of constituents denoted by 1, \u2026, S which assemble into rings of size L. The cases S=1 and 1<S\u2264L ( S=L ) are denoted as homogeneous and partially ( fully ) heterogeneous, respectively. The homogeneous model builds on previous work on virus capsid ( Chen et al., 2008; Hagan et al., 2011 ), linear protein filament assembly ( Michaels et al., 2016;\u00a0Michaels et al., 2017; D'Orsogna et al., 2012 ) and aggregation and polymerization models ( Krapivsky et al., 2010 ). The heterogeneous model in turn links to previous model systems used to study, for example, DNA-brick-based assembly of heterogeneous structures ( Murugan et al., 2015; Hedges et al., 2014; D'Orsogna et al., 2013 ). We emphasize that, even though strikingly similar experimental realizations of our model exist ( Gerling et al., 2015; Wagenbauer et al., 2017; Praetorius and Dietz, 2017 ), it is not intended to describe any particular system. The ring structure represents a general linear assembly process involving building blocks with equivalent binding properties and resulting in a target of finite size. The main assumption in the ring model is that the different constituents assemble linearly in a sequential order. In many biological self-assembling systems like bacterial flagellum assembly or biogenesis of the ribosome subunits the assumption of a linear binding sequence appears to be justified ( Pe\u00f1a et al., 2017; Chevance and Hughes, 2008 ). In order to test the validity of our results beyond these constraints we also perform stochastic simulations of generalized self-assembling systems that do not obey a sequential binding order: i ) by explicitly allowing for polymer-polymer bindings and ii ) by considering the assembly of finite sized squares that grow independently in two dimensions ( see Figures 6 and 7 ). The assembly process starts with N inactive monomers of each species. We use C=N/V to denote the initial concentration of each monomer species, where V is the reaction volume. Monomers are activated independently at the same per capita rate \u03b1, and, once active, are available for binding. Binding takes place only between constituents of species with periodically consecutive indices, for example 1 and 2 or S and 1 ( leading to structures such as \u2026\u20621231\u2062\u2026 for S=3 ) ; see Figure 1. To avoid ambiguity, we restrict ring sizes to integer multiples of the number of species S. Furthermore, we neglect the possibility of incorrect binding, for\u00a0example species 1 binding to 3 or S-1. Polymers, that\u00a0is incomplete ring structures, grow via consecutive attachment of monomers. For simplicity, polymer-polymer binding is disregarded at first, as it is typically assumed to be of minor importance ( Zlotnick et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2008; Murugan et al., 2015; Haxton and Whitelam, 2013 ). To probe the robustness of the model, later we consider an extended model including polymer-polymer binding for which the results are qualitatively the same ( see Figure 6 and the discussion ). Furthermore, it has been observed that nucleation phenomena play a critical role for self-assembly processes ( Ke et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2012; Reinhardt and Frenkel, 2014; Chen et al., 2008 ). So it is in general necessary to take into account a critical nucleation size, which marks the transition between slow particle nucleation and the faster subsequent structure growth ( Michaels et al., 2016; Lazaro and Hagan, 2016; Morozov et al., 2009; Murugan et al., 2015 ). We denote this critical nucleation size by Lnuc, which in terms of classical nucleation theory corresponds to the structure size at which the free energy barrier has its maximum. For l<Lnuc attachment of monomers to existing structures and decay of structures ( reversible binding ) into monomers take place at size-dependent reaction rates \u03bcl and \u03b4l, respectively ( Figure 1 ). Here, we focus on identical rates \u03bcl=\u03bc and \u03b4l=\u03b4. A discussion of the general case is given in Appendix 4. Above the nucleation size, polymers grow by attachment of monomers with reaction rate \u03bd\u2265\u03bc per binding site. As we consider successfully nucleated structures to be stable on the observational time scales, monomer detachment from structures above the critical nucelation size is neglected ( irreversible binding ) ( Murugan et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2008 ). Complete rings neither grow nor decay ( absorbing state ). We investigate two scenarios for the control of nucleation speed, first separately and then in combination. For the \u2018activation scenario\u2019 we set \u03bc=\u03bd ( all binding rates are equal ) and control the assembly process by varying the activation rate \u03b1. For the \u2018dimerization scenario\u2019 all particles are inherently active ( \u03b1\u2192\u221e ) and we control the assembly process by varying the dimerization rate \u03bc ( we focus on Lnuc=2 ). It has been demonstrated previously in Chen et al. ( 2008 ) and ( Endres and Zlotnick, 2002; Hagan and Elrad, 2010; Morozov et al., 2009 ) that either a slow activation or a slow dimerization step are suitable in principle to retard nucleation and favour growth of the structures over the initiation of new ones. We quantify the quality of the assembly process in terms of the assembly yield, defined as the number of successfully assembled ring structures relative to the maximal possible number N\u2062S/L. Yield is measured when all resources have been used up and the system has reached its final state. We do not discuss the assembly time in this manuscript, however, in Appendix 5 we show typical trajectories for the time evolution of the yield in the activation and dimerization scenario. If the assembly product is stable ( absorbing state ), the yield can only increase with time. Consequently, the final yield constitutes the upper limit for the yield irrespective of additional time constraints. Therefore, the final yield is an informative and unambiguous observable to describe the efficiency of the assembly reaction. We simulated our system both stochastically via Gillespie\u2019s algorithm ( Gillespie, 2007 ) and deterministically as a set of ordinary differential equations corresponding to chemical rate equations ( see Appendix 1 ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The self-assembly of a large biological molecule from small building blocks is like finishing a puzzle of magnetic pieces by shaking the box. Even though each piece of the puzzle is attracted to its correct neighbours, the limited control makes it very hard to finish the puzzle in a short amount of time. The problem becomes even more difficult if several copies of the same puzzle are assembled in one box. If several puzzles start at the same time, the different parts might steal pieces from each other, making it impossible to successfully complete any of the puzzles. This is called a depletion trap. If the box is only shaken and there is no real control over individual pieces, these traps occur at random. Overcoming these random depletion traps is an important challenge when assembling nanostructures and other artificial molecules designed by humans without wasting many, potentially expensive, components. Previous studies have shown that when multiple copies of the same structure are assembled simultaneously, slowing the rate of initiation increases the yield of correctly-made structures. This prevents new structures from stealing pieces from existing structures before they are fully completed. Now, Gartner, Graf, Wilke et al. have used a mathematical model to show that changing the way initiation is delayed leads to different yields. This was especially true for small systems where fluctuations in the availability of the different pieces strongly enhanced the initiation of new structures. In these cases, the self-assembly process terminated undesirably with many incomplete structures. Nanostructures have various applications ranging from drug delivery to robotics. These findings suggest that in order to efficiently assemble biological molecules, the concentrations of the different building blocks need to be tightly controlled. A question for further research is to investigate strategies that reduce fluctuations in the availability of the building blocks to develop more efficient assembly protocols ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe transition from the juvenile to adult phase in plants is controlled by diverse exogenous and endogenous cues such as age, day length, light, nutrients, and temperature. Previous studies have shown that the gradual decline in microRNA156 ( miR156 ) with age promotes the expression of adult traits. However, how age temporally regulates the abundance of miR156 is poorly understood. We show here that the expression of miR156 responds to sugar. Sugar represses miR156 expression at both the transcriptional level and post-transcriptional level through the degradation of miR156 primary transcripts. Defoliation and photosynthetic mutant assays further demonstrate that sugar from the pre-existing leaves acts as a mobile signal to repress miR156, and subsequently triggers the juvenile-to-adult phase transition in young leaf primordia. We propose that the gradual increase in sugar after seed germination serves as an endogenous cue for developmental timing in plants.  After seed germination, plants undergo two developmental transitions: juvenile-to-adult and adult-to-reproductive ( B\u00e4urle and Dean, 2006 ). The transition from the juvenile to adult phase is marked by acquisition of reproductive competence and changes in leaf morphology ( Poethig, 2010 ). The adult to reproductive transition, also known as flowering, transforms the identity of the shoot apical meristem from vegetative into inflorescence. Physiological and genetic studies have demonstrated that both developmental transitions are regulated not only by environmental signals such as day length, light intensity, and ambient temperature, but also by endogenous signals transmitted by plant hormones and age. microRNA156 ( miR156 ), which targets SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE ( SPL ) transcriptional factors, provides an endogenous age cue for developmental timing in plants ( Poethig, 2010 ). The expression of miR156 decreases over time, with a concomitant rise in SPL level ( Wu and Poethig, 2006; Wang et al., 2009 ). Overexpression of miR156 prolongs the juvenile phase, whereas a reduction in miR156 level results in an accelerated expression of adult traits ( Wu and Poethig, 2006; Wu et al., 2009 ). SPL promotes the juvenile-to-adult phase transition and flowering through activation of miR172 and MADS-box genes ( Wang et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2009; Yamaguchi et al., 2009; Jung et al., 2011 ). Very recently, defoliation experiments and expression analyses demonstrated that the repression of miR156 in the leaf primordia is mediated by a mobile signal ( s ) derived from the pre-existing leaves ( Yang et al. 2011 ). However, the identity of this signal is still unknown. In addition to being essential as prime carbon and energy sources, sugars also play critical roles as signaling molecules ( Rolland and Sheen, 2005; Smeekens et al., 2010 ). In Arabidopsis thaliana, diverse sugar signals are perceived and transduced through a glucose sensor, HEXOKINASE1 ( HXK1 ). HXK1 exerts its regulatory function through distinct molecular mechanisms including transcriptional activation, translational inhibition, mRNA decay, and protein degradation ( Rolland and Sheen, 2005 ). Analyses of two catalytic inactive HXK1 alleles further indicate that the signaling activity of HXK1 is uncoupled from its catalytic activity ( Moore et al., 2003 ). Recently, a nuclear HXK1 complex has been identified ( Cho et al., 2006 ). In this complex, HXK1 binds to two unconventional partners, the vacuolar H+-ATPase B1 ( VHA-B1 ) and the 19S regulatory particle of a proteasome subunit ( RPT5B ). Since neither VHA-B1 nor RPT5B has DNA binding capacity, the precise molecular mechanism by which this nuclear-localized HXK1 complex regulates gene expression remains unanswered. In addition to the HXK1-dependent pathway, some glucose-responsive genes are regulated through an HXK1-independent pathway. For instance, the expression of the genes encoding chalcone synthase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and asparagine synthase responds to glucose signaling in the absence of HXK1 ( Xiao et al., 2000 ). Here, we performed expression and mutant analyses to identify the upstream regulator of miR156. Our results demonstrate that the expression of miR156 quickly responds to sugar. Sugar reduces miR156 abundance through both transcriptional repression and transcript degradation. Thus, gradual accumulation of sugar after seed germination leads to a reduced level of miR156, which promotes the juvenile-to-adult phase transition in plants.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Like animals, plants go through several stages of development before they reach maturity, and it has long been thought that some of the transitions between these stages are triggered by changes in the nutritional status of the plant. Now, based on experiments with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, Yu et al. and, independently, Yang et al. have provided fresh insights into the role of sugar in \u2018vegetative phase change'\u2014the transition from the juvenile form of a plant to the adult plant. The new work takes advantage of the fact that vegetative phase change is controlled by two genes that encode microRNAs ( MIRNAs ). Arabidopsis has eight MIR156 genes and both groups confirmed that supplying plants with sugar reduces the expression of two of these\u2014MIR156A and MIR156C\u2014while sugar deprivation increases their expression. Removing leaves also leads to upregulation of both genes, and delays the juvenile-to-adult transition. Given that this effect can be partially reversed by providing the plant with sugar, it is likely that sugar produced in the leaves\u2014or one of its metabolites\u2014is the signal that triggers the juvenile-to-adult transition through the reduction of miR156 levels. Yu and co-workers confirmed that sugar also reduces the expression of MIR156 in tobacco, moss, and tomato plants, suggesting that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Consistent with the work of Yang and colleagues, Yu and co-workers revealed that sugar is able to reduce the transcription of MIR156A and MIR156C genes into messenger RNA. Moreover, they showed that sugar can also suppress MIR156 expression by promoting the breakdown of MIR156A and MIR156C primary messenger RNA transcripts. The work of Yu et al. and Yang et al. has thus provided key insights into the mechanisms by which a leaf-derived signal controls a key developmental change in plants. Just as fruit flies use their nutritional status to regulate the onset of metamorphosis, and mammals use it to control the onset of puberty, so plants use the level of sugar in their leaves to trigger the transition from juvenile to adult forms ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nEvolution has often copied and repurposed the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling module. Understanding how connections form during evolution, in disease and across individuals requires knowledge of the basic tenets that govern kinase-substrate interactions. We identify criteria sufficient for establishing regulatory links between a MAPK and a non-native substrate. The yeast MAPK Fus3 and human MAPK ERK2 can be functionally redirected if only two conditions are met: the kinase and substrate contain matching interaction domains and the substrate includes a phospho-motif that can be phosphorylated by the kinase and recruit a downstream effector. We used a panel of interaction domains and phosphorylation-activated degradation motifs to demonstrate modular and scalable retargeting. We applied our approach to reshape the signaling behavior of an existing kinase pathway. Together, our results demonstrate that a MAPK can be largely defined by its interaction domains and compatible phospho-motifs and provide insight into how MAPK-substrate connections form.  The MAPK family of proteins is a ubiquitous signaling element in eukaryotes, and is essential to the function of a wide variety of cellular behaviors, from the regulation of differentiation and proliferation to stress responses and more ( Cargnello and Roux, 2011 ) ; this diversity of functions has been made possible by the evolutionary expansion of the MAPK repertoire ( Caffrey et al., 1999; Manning et al., 2002 ). For the expansion of the MAPK signaling module to have been feasible, it needed to be amenable to forming new kinase-substrate regulatory links, while at the same time having the capacity to avoid unwanted crosstalk. However, it still remains unclear what information is sufficient to create an entirely new set of regulatory interactions. One way to understand how potentially large numbers of novel regulatory links can be established is by developing a scalable method to create such links ourselves ( Elowitz and Lim, 2010 ). What are the core components necessary for the formation of a new \u2013 functional \u2013 kinase-substrate interaction ? Following the association of the kinase and substrate, the amino acids in the immediate vicinity of the phosphorylated residue \u2013 together making up the \u2018phospho-motif\u2019 \u2013 help to dictate whether the substrate is phosphorylated by the kinase ( Mok et al., 2010; Howard et al., 2014 ). However, it is the site that is phosphorylated \u2013 rather than the kinase itself \u2013 that mediates the functional outcome of kinase regulation. In particular, the phosphorylated phospho-motif can be recognized by a regulatory protein bearing a phospho-motif binding domain and control protein localization or degradation among many other effects ( Seet et al., 2006; Bhattacharyya et al., 2006 ). Even before the kinase has a chance to interact with the phospho-motif, the two proteins must be colocalized ( Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007 ). Residues apart from the kinase active site are frequently responsible for recognizing a substrate; indeed, several studies have sought to modify or replace these residues in a variety of kinases to redirect them to new \u2013 but still related \u2013 targets ( Skerker et al., 2008; Won et al., 2011; Grewal et al., 2006 ). Adaptor proteins, such as synthetic scaffolds, have also been used to steer a kinase towards a particular native substrate ( Park et al., 2003; Whitaker et al., 2012; Hobert and Schepartz, 2012; Harris et al., 2001 ). Regulation of a modified native substrate by a kinase can also be rescued using a pair of completely heterologous interaction domains ( Yadav et al., 2009 ). These studies show that by controlling the colocalization of a kinase with a native \u2013 or closely related \u2013 substrate allows the functional regulation of that target. Taking it a step further, two groups have recently used native MAPK-interacting motifs \u2013 \u2018docking domains\u2019 \u2013 to allow several types of MAPKs in mammalian cells and yeast to regulate the nuclear localization of fluorescent reporters ( Regot et al., 2014; Durandau et al., 2015 ). Although it is generally accepted that docking domains primarily control colocalization ( Sharrocks et al., 2000 ), several studies suggest that binding may also serve to allosterically regulate the MAPK ( Chang et al., 2002; Heo et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2006; Tokunaga et al., 2014; Bhattacharyya et al., 2006 ). As such, the precise role of these interactions remains unclear. Regardless, the question of how completely new and orthogonal regulatory relationships are created remains. Like the signaling modules that have been expanded in natural systems, engineered genetic circuits also rely on components that are amenable to rewiring. The creation of novel transcription factors has been successful in a large part because the necessary functional characteristics have been identified. Importantly, these characteristics can be embodied in distinct modular DNA and protein domains, such as promoters, transcriptional-regulation domains, and DNA-binding domains \u2013 these domains can then be mixed and matched to yield the desired connectivity and regulation ( Khalil et al., 2012; Stanton et al., 2014; Kiani et al., 2014; Zalatan et al., 2015; Khakhar et al., 2015 ). Although hurdles to creating large genetic circuits remain ( Brophy and Voigt, 2014; Cardinale and Arkin, 2012 ), these parts have allowed scientists to construct and interrogate more complex engineered and naturally occurring genetic systems ( Prindle et al., 2012; Gilbert et al., 2014 ). Unfortunately, our understanding of how to assemble modular post-translational signaling proteins lags behind. At the same time, recent work with engineered modular receptors expressed on T-cells has shown the considerable power of the ability to rationally design even relatively simple post-translational signaling systems ( Wu et al., 2015; Roybal et al., 2016; Morsut et al., 2016 ). Targeting a kinase to a new substrate is an essential step towards creating modular kinase signaling systems. As discussed above, Regot et al. and Durandau et al. have described an approach wherein a kinase-specific docking domain can be used to direct a particular kinase to a new substrate\u2014a powerful tool for interrogating natural kinase signaling systems ( Regot et al., 2014; Durandau et al., 2015 ). However, the number of naturally occurring kinase-substrate docking interactions inherently limits the scalability of the approach. For example, a given kinase \u2018module\u2019 cannot be reused in parallel signaling pathways, because it would not be able to distinguish between downstream targets in one pathway versus another. To overcome this limitation, it would be useful to be able to tease apart the \u2018targeting\u2019 module of the kinase from the \u2018enzymatic\u2019 module\u2014and likewise, the \u2018targeting\u2019 and \u2018effector\u2019 modules of the substrate. If these functions can be defined as separable parts, the enzymatic module of a kinase would be available for reuse in orthogonal pathways, just by pairing it with unique targeting domains. We have used simple, single-function modular protein domains to explicitly test the requirements for allowing a MAPK to regulate an arbitrary substrate protein. We utilized modular interaction domains to co-localize Fus3 \u2013 the terminal MAPK of the mating pathway of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae \u2013 with a substrate of interest. To link phosphorylation of the substrate to a meaningful regulation event we utilized phosphorylation-activated ubiquitination-based signaling motifs\u2014phosphodegrons. We re-targeted Fus3 to regulate several disparate proteins to determine the flexibility of the substrate design rules. Likewise, to determine whether this approach generalizes to other MAPKs, we retargeted a constitutively active version of the mammalian MAPK, ERK2, to functionally regulate a fluorescent reporter in yeast. We explored the effect that synthetically implemented post-translational regulatory connections could have on the signaling of an endogenous kinase cascade in yeast. Our results demonstrate that these new connections can be used to alter the natural signaling behaviors, damping signal amplification and even yielding concentration-based band-pass filtering. Taken together, in this paper, we define a modular set of scalable components that can be utilized to rewire MAPKs to regulate proteins through ubiquitination. Attempting to rationally design new kinase-substrate regulatory links not only sheds light on the natural processes, but also serves as the foundation for the construction of synthetic kinase signaling pathways, and with them the control of cell behaviors in biomedical or biotechnological applications.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Nature has evolved a number of ways to link signals from a cell\u2019s environment, like the concentration of a hormone, to the behavior of that cell. These new connections often form by reusing certain common signaling components, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases. These enzymes \u2013 referred to as MAPKs for short \u2013 are activated by specific signals and alter the activity of target proteins in the cell by adding a phosphate group to them: a process called phosphorylation. These connections thus dictate how cells respond to their environments \u2013 and consequently, disruptions to the connections are a common source of disease. Groves, Khakhar et al. set out to understand how connections can be made between a MAPK and a new target protein to gain insights into how these links emerge through evolution and how they might break in disease. Their approach focused on one of the ways that phosphorylation can alter the activity of a target protein: marking it for degradation. Experiments with budding yeast showed that a MAPK could only achieve this if two conditions are met. First, the target protein and kinase need to bind to each other. Second, the target needs to contain a site that when phosphorylated is subsequently recognized by the cell\u2019s protein degradation machinery. By engineering proteins so that they fulfilled these two criteria, Groves, Khakhar et al. created new connections between a yeast MAPK called Fus3 or a human MAPK called ERK2 and a variety of targets. The results showed that the parts of the proteins involved in the interaction step could be completely separate from the parts that are involved in the phosphorylation step. This suggests that connections between kinases and their targets can be rewired simple by mixing together parts of other existing proteins. Finally, Groves, Khakhar et al. confirmed that engineered connections between kinases and targets could predictably change how yeast cells responded to a hormone that normally controls the yeast\u2019s reproductive cycle. Together these results bring us one step closer to understanding how cells assemble the signaling pathways that they use to process information. However further work is needed to see if these findings can be generalized to other signaling components, and if so, to explore if new connections can be built to yield more complicated cellular behaviors ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nN-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors ( NMDA-Rs ) are ion channels that are important for synaptic plasticity, which is involved in learning and drug addiction. We show enzymatic targeting of an NMDA-R antagonist, MK801, to a molecularly defined neuronal population with the cell-type-selectivity of genetic methods and the temporal control of pharmacology. We find that NMDA-Rs on dopamine neurons are necessary for cocaine-induced synaptic potentiation, demonstrating that cell type-specific pharmacology can be used to dissect signaling pathways within complex brain circuits.  N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors ( NMDA-Rs ) are glutamate-gated ion channels that are critical for the regulation of synaptic functions in the central nervous system, such as synaptic plasticity ( Malenka and Nicoll, 1993; Collingridge et al., 2004 ). NMDA-R dependent synaptic plasticity plays an important role in learning. This includes learning that can also have maladaptive consequences, for example sensitization of drug-related behaviors ( Kalivas and Alesdatter, 1993; Ungless et al., 2001 ). However, because NMDA-Rs are expressed in most cell types in the brain ( Conti et al., 1997; Verkhratsky and Kirchhoff, 2007 ), it is a considerable challenge to selectively assess the importance of NMDA-R mediated synaptic plasticity in specific cell types. The functional contribution of NMDA-Rs to physiology and behavior can be examined using either genetic or pharmacological methods. Small molecule antagonists allow rapid blockade of NMDA-Rs, which has been critical for analyzing synaptic plasticity processes that operate over short timescales. However, existing pharmacological agents are not cell type-selective. Alternatively, genetic methods can be used, typically involving Cre-recombinase ( Cre ) -mediated excision of a loxP flanked exon in Grin1, which encodes a critical NMDA-R subunit that is required for channel function. This allows cell type-specific ablation of NMDA-R function by crossing to a mouse line with cell type-selective expression of Cre or by spatially targeted injection of Cre-expressing viral vectors. A major limitation is that genetic methods are not fast; they typically disrupt NMDA-Rs over timescales ranging from a week to the lifetime of an animal, during which time substantial compensatory effects in circuit function are observed ( Engblom et al., 2008; Zweifel et al., 2008 ). Here, we describe an approach to combine the cell type-selectivity of genetic methods with the temporal control of pharmacology by targeting a small molecule NMDA-R antagonist to molecularly defined neuronal cell types ( Figure 1A ). 10. 7554/eLife. 10206. 003Figure 1.

The learning process is regulated by receptors on the surface of brain cells called N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors ( or NMDA receptors for short ). These receptors help to strengthen signals between brain cells, which allows a new concept or action to be learned. However, it has been difficult to pin down how the role of NMDA receptors selectively in specific types of brain cells. While drugs can be used to quickly block NMDA receptors throughout the brain, it is hard to target drugs to a specific cell type. Also, genetic engineering can be used to selectively knock out NMDA receptors in certain types of brain cells, but these techniques are too slow, and can take weeks or even a lifetime to work. Now, Yang et al. have developed a clever way to combine an NMDA-blocking drug and genetic engineering to study NMDA receptors' responses to cocaine in specific brain cells. This approach involved first creating an inactive form of an NMDA-blocking drug that can only becomes active when it is processed by an enzyme that is normally produced in pigs' livers. Next, living mouse brain cells, including some that were engineered to express the pig enzyme, were exposed to the drug in the laboratory. The drug blocked the NMDA receptors on brain cells that expressed the enzyme, but not the receptors on nearby brain cells that lacked the enzyme. This occurred even though all the cells produced NMDA receptors and all were exposed to the drug. NMDA receptors have been known to play an important role in cocaine addiction for more than 20 years. Drugs like cocaine can co-opt the normally healthy learning process involving NMDA receptors and lead to a maladaptive form of learning that is commonly called addiction. Cocaine strengthens signals between brain cells causing the behaviors associated with using cocaine to become deeply ingrained and difficult to change. Yang et al. used cell type-specific targeting of a drug that blocks NMDA receptors to observe what happened in cocaine-exposed brain cells with, or without, working NMDA receptors. As expected, the experiments showed that cocaine didn't strengthen brain signals in cells without working NMDA receptors. Specifically, the experiments showed that NMDA receptors on a type of brain cell that release a pleasure-inducing chemical called dopamine are necessary for cocaine\u2013induced synaptic plasticity. The combination technique developed by Yang et al. will likely be used by other scientists to further study the role of NMDA receptors in specific brain cells during addiction and normal brain activity ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe experience of rewarding or aversive stimuli is encoded by distinct afferents to dopamine ( DA ) neurons of the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ). Several neuromodulatory systems including oxytocin regulate DA neuron excitability and synaptic transmission that process socially meaningful stimuli. We and others have recently characterized oxytocinergic modulation of activity in mouse VTA DA neurons, but the mechanisms underlying oxytocinergic modulation of synaptic transmission in DA neurons remain poorly understood. Here, we find that oxytocin application or optogenetic release decrease excitatory synaptic transmission, via long lasting, presynaptic, endocannabinoid-dependent mechanisms. Oxytocin modulation of excitatory transmission alters the magnitude of short and long-term depression. We find that only some glutamatergic projections to DA neurons express CB1 receptors. Optogenetic stimulation of three major VTA inputs demonstrates that oxytocin modulation is limited to projections that show evidence of CB1R transcripts. Thus, oxytocin gates information flow into reward circuits in a temporally selective and pathway-specific manner.  Dopamine ( DA ) neurons in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) play a pivotal role in signaling reward-related stimuli ( Wise, 2004 ). Alterations in the function of VTA DA neurons have been linked to drug abuse ( Kauer and Malenka, 2007; Niehaus et al., 2009 ), as well as neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) ( Bariselli et al., 2016 ), schizophrenia, and depression ( Grace, 2016 ). DA neurons exhibit two activity patterns in vivo \u2013 low frequency tonic firing ( 1\u20135 Hz ) and burst, or phasic, firing patterns ( Floresco et al., 2003; Grace and Bunney, 1984 ). Phasic activity of DA neurons is observed when an animal is in an environment with strong reward salience ( Schultz, 1998; Schultz et al., 2015 ), resulting in large transient increases in DA concentration in the ventral striatum. These DA increases have been directly assayed using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry ( Tsai et al., 2009 ) and are well-matched by recent optical imaging studies that demonstrate unpredicted reward-associated calcium transients in the axons of VTA DA neurons expressing genetically encoded calcium sensors ( Howe and Dombeck, 2016 ). Glutamatergic afferents to DA neurons are thought to control transitions between tonic and phasic activity ( Canavier and Landry, 2006; Floresco et al., 2003; Overton and Clark, 1997 ). For the VTA, these inputs arise from multiple brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ), lateral habenular nucleus ( LHb ) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus ( PPN ) ( Geisler et al., 2007; Good and Lupica, 2009; Morales and Margolis, 2017 ). Neuronal activity and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the VTA are tightly regulated by a diverse group of neuromodulators acting on G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ). VTA DA neurons express numerous GPCRs, including dopamine Drd2 receptor ( Vallone et al., 2000 ), as well as receptors for serotonin ( Doherty and Pickel, 2000 ), corticotropin-releasing factor ( Ungless et al., 2003 ), orexin ( Korotkova et al., 2003 ), vasopressin, and oxytocin ( Skuse and Gallagher, 2009; Xiao et al., 2017 ), among others. Several GPCR families are known to modulate neuronal activity and synaptic transmission in VTA DA neurons ( Bonci and Malenka, 1999; Borgland et al., 2006; Ungless et al., 2003 ), but our understanding of how neurohypophyseal peptides control synaptic transmission in the midbrain dopamine system is limited. Oxytocin is one of the two major neurohypophyseal peptides that function centrally as a neuromodulator and has been linked to the processing of socially rewarding stimuli via actions in the striatum and in the neocortex ( Choe et al., 2015; D\u00f6len et al., 2013; Marlin et al., 2015 ). In the nucleus accumbens, oxytocin weakens glutamatergic synaptic transmission through presynaptic mechanisms involving serotonergic inputs from the dorsal raphe nucleus ( D\u00f6len et al., 2013 ), and in the mPFC, oxytocin application dampens glutamatergic synaptic transmission through presynaptic endocannabinoid signaling ( Ninan, 2011 ). Yet, in the auditory and piriform cortex, oxytocin application or evoked release dampen inhibitory transmission without altering excitatory input processing ( Mitre et al., 2016 ). Oxytocin neurons residing in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVN ) directly project to the VTA and activate oxytocin receptors ( OxtRs ) to regulate the tonic activity of DA neurons and social behavior ( Beier et al., 2015; Hung et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2017 ). Consistent with oxytocin-driven enhancement in the activity of VTA DA neurons, oxytocin infusions into the VTA potentiate social reward ( Song et al., 2016 ) and modulate reward-based behavior ( Mullis et al., 2013 ). Given these observations, we reasoned that oxytocin is poised to regulate synaptic transmission in the VTA. Recently, OxtR agonist was found to regulate synaptic inputs to a specific subpopulation of VTA DA neurons that project to medial nucleus accumbens, altering the balance of excitation and inhibition through cellular mechanisms that remain incompletely understood ( Hung et al., 2017 ). Here, we delve deeper into the function of oxytocin in regulating evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) in genetically targeted VTA DA neurons by relying on pharmacological methods, optogenetics, retrograde tracing, quantitative triple-channel in situ hybridization, and 2-photon imaging with single synapse 2-photon uncaging, or photorelease, of glutamate. We find that oxytocin inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission through OxtRs and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in a cell-autonomous manner, with timing and effect magnitudes sufficient to modulate both short- and long-term plasticity in VTA DA neurons.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The mammalian brain contains millions of nerve cells or neurons that communicate with each other via a process called neurotransmission. To send a message to its neighbor, a neuron releases a chemical called a neurotransmitter into the space between the cells. The neurotransmitter then binds to receiver proteins on the target cell. Another group of chemicals, known as neuromodulators, regulate this process, adjusting the way that neurons respond to neurotransmitters. In doing so, they help regulate many types of behavior in mammals. The neuromodulator oxytocin, for example, has earned the nickname \u2018the love hormone\u2019 because it promotes social behavior and bonding. It does this in part by altering the activity of neurons in a brain region called the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ). These neurons produce the brain\u2019s main reward signal, dopamine, which is itself a neuromodulator. But exactly how oxytocin affects the activity of dopamine-producing neurons is unclear. By recording from individual neurons in slices of mouse brain tissue, Xiao et al. show that oxytocin filters inputs to dopamine neurons in the VTA. It does this by making the dopamine neurons release another group of reward signals, known as endocannabinoids. These are the brain\u2019s own version of the chemicals found inside cannabis plants. The endocannabinoids bind to neurons that provide input to the VTA dopamine neurons. Some of these input neurons normally activate the VTA by releasing a neurotransmitter called glutamate. However, the binding of endocannabinoids decreases their ability to do this, and thereby lowers the activation of the VTA dopamine neurons. But not all glutamate neurons are sensitive to endocannabinoids. Moreover, oxytocin affects glutamate neurons that fire repeatedly less than it affects those that fire only occasionally. Oxytocin thus acts as a filter. It allows certain inputs \u2013 those that are repeatedly active and those that are insensitive to endocannabinoids \u2013 to continue activating VTA dopamine neurons. At the same time, it weakens the influence of other inputs. Dopamine release in the VTA drives drug abuse and addiction. Understanding how oxytocin affects VTA neurons may thus open up new avenues for the treatment of addiction disorders ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nContamination with exogenous DNA is a constant hazard to ancient DNA studies, since their validity greatly depend on the ancient origin of the retrieved sequences. Since contamination occurs sporadically, it is fundamental to show positive evidence for the authenticity of ancient DNA sequences even when preventive measures to avoid contamination are implemented. Recently the presence of wheat in the United Kingdom 8000 years before the present has been reported based on an analysis of sedimentary ancient DNA ( Smith et al. 2015 ). Smith et al. did not present any positive evidence for the authenticity of their results due to the small number of sequencing reads that were confidently assigned to wheat. We developed a computational method that compares postmortem damage patterns of a test dataset with bona fide ancient and modern DNA. We applied this test to the putative wheat DNA and find that these reads are most likely not of ancient origin.  The evolutionary reconstruction of the past has been greatly enriched by direct interrogation of ancient DNA ( aDNA ) from plants and animal remains ( Shapiro and Hofreiter, 2014 ). Although a vast proportion of flora and fauna do not fossilize, traces of their DNA may be preserved in sediments allowing the characterization of past biodiversity ( Pedersen et al., 2015 ). A challenge to exploiting such resources is the ubiquitous threat of contamination with exogenous DNA. Therefore, special sample preparation procedures have been developed to reduce DNA contamination ( Cooper and Poinar, 2000 ). Nevertheless, it remains difficult to estimate how well preventive measures work. If contamination is a possible explanation for the result, it is crucial to exclude this possibility by giving positive evidence for the authenticity of aDNA ( Pr\u00fcfer and Meyer, 2015 ). Fortunately, a large number of full-length DNA sequences can be generated using next generation sequencing, which allows for the authentication of aDNA. In aDNA an excess of C-to-T ( cytosine to thymine ) substitutions occur at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of molecules ( or its mirror image G-to-A ( guanine to adenine ) at the 3\u2032 end, depending on the library protocol employed ). When considering the 5\u2032 end of sequences, the excess of C-to-T substitutions is highest at the first base and decreases exponentially towards the center ( Figure 1A ). This pattern is the result of cytosine deamination to uracil in single stranded overhangs ( Briggs et al., 2007 ). Since it is present in aDNA-derived sequences but absent in much younger samples, it has been used as an authentication criterion in aDNA experiments ( Krause et al., 2010; Pr\u00fcfer and Meyer, 2015 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 10005. 003Figure 1. Patterns of cytosine to thymine ( C-to-T ) substitutions at the 5\u2032end of known modern and ancient DNA.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10005. 003 Smith et al. analyzed sediments from Bouldnor Cliff, a submerged archeological site in the United Kingdom, and suggested the presence of domesticated wheat 8000 years ago based on sedimentary ancient DNA ( sedaDNA ). This is 2000 years earlier than expected based on archeological remains in the British Isles and 400 years earlier than in nearby European sites ( reviewed in Smith et al. ). Since Smith et al. did not find wheat pollen or archeological remains associated with wheat cultivation, they conclude that the wheat presence in Bouldnor Cliff was the result of trading. In total they produced \u223c72 million Illumina reads, of which they robustly assigned 152 to wheat ( Triticum ), with dozens more ( 160 reads ) to higher taxonomic ranks that include wheat. Smith et al. took state-of-the art preventive measures to avoid contamination and exercised great effort to ensure the accuracy and robustness of their phylogenetic assignments. The authors attempted to authenticate the aDNA molecules based on the expected excess of C-to-T substitutions, but because of the very small number of reads assigned to wheat, they failed to do so using standard approaches. As a result of that, the authors did not present any positive evidence for the ancient origin of their reads. Here we present an approach that compares the pattern of C-to-T substitutions in a set of test reads with the distributions of C-to-T substitutions in reads from known ancient- and modern-DNA and apply this approach to sedaDNA from Smith et al.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Ancient DNA, that is to say DNA extracted from fossils and ancient remains, provides a window into the past lives of humans, animals and plants. But working with ancient DNA is challenging; DNA decomposes with time, and so ancient DNA is often fragmented, damaged and present in tiny quantities. Furthermore, ancient DNA is also easily contaminated by modern DNA from those handling it and its surroundings. Researchers have therefore developed special protocols for working with ancient DNA and tests for its contamination. One approach used to check that DNA is of ancient origin identifies a pattern of damage that is specific to ancient DNA. This damage changes the building blocks that make up DNA, causing one ( called cytosine or C ) to be misread as another ( thymine or T ). This substitution occurs most frequently at the ends of ancient DNA molecules, and occurs less often along its length, forming a detectable and characteristic pattern of damage. A common way to analyse ancient DNA is to sequence it and then compare the resulting sequences to the genomes of modern organisms to identify its origins. In a study published earlier in 2015, investigators sequenced the DNA present in sediments obtained from a submerged archaeological site off the coast of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. This previous study identified some DNA fragments that matched sequences in the wheat genome. This led the investigators to conclude that wheat was present in the British Isles around 8000 years ago, some 2000 years earlier than previously thought. However, possibly owing to the small number of fragments that were found, the previous study did not check if the damage pattern matched that expected for ancient DNA. Now, Wei\u00df et al. have developed a new computational method that tests whether DNA shows a typically ancient, or typically modern, pattern of C-to-T substitutions. When this test was used to assess the wheat sequences that were previously claimed to have ancient origins, it revealed that their pattern of DNA damage did not fit statistically with those of ancient DNA. Wei\u00df et al. 's findings contest those of the earlier study, and suggest that the new statistical method could be used to authenticate ancient DNA even when the number of available sequences is low ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nIn systemic light chain amyloidosis, an overexpressed antibody light chain ( LC ) forms fibrils which deposit in organs and cause their failure. While it is well-established that mutations in the LC\u2019s VL domain are important prerequisites, the mechanisms which render a patient LC amyloidogenic are ill-defined. In this study, we performed an in-depth analysis of the factors and mutations responsible for the pathogenic transformation of a patient-derived \u03bb LC, by recombinantly expressing variants in E. coli. We show that proteolytic cleavage of the patient LC resulting in an isolated VL domain is essential for fibril formation. Out of 11 mutations in the patient VL, only one, a leucine to valine mutation, is responsible for fibril formation. It disrupts a hydrophobic network rendering the C-terminal segment of VL more dynamic and decreasing domain stability. Thus, the combination of proteolytic cleavage and the destabilizing mutation trigger conformational changes that turn the LC pathogenic.  Amyloid light chain ( AL ) amyloidosis is the most common form of systemic amyloidosis. It is the result of an anomalous monoclonal plasma B cell proliferation in the bone marrow which leads to a subsequent overproduction of immunoglobulin light chains ( LC ) ( Baden et al., 2009; Gertz, 2016 ). Normally, immunoglobulins ( Igs ) are secreted as disulfide-bonded complexes comprising two heavy chains ( HCs ) and two LCs ( Baden et al., 2008; Feige et al., 2010 ). In AL patients, free LCs excessively escape cellular protein quality control and are secreted into the blood stream. From there, the amyloid precursor LCs can be taken up by cells or deposit extracellularly in organs or tissues ( Baden et al., 2008; Falk et al., 1997; Feige et al., 2010; Gertz, 2016; Kastritis and Dimopoulos, 2016; Marin-Argany et al., 2016 ). The LCs are composed of an N-terminal variable ( VL ) and a constant domain ( CL ). The VL sequence is the result of DNA rearrangements involving a variable ( V ), a diversity ( D ) and a joining ( J ) gene segment ( Bernard et al., 1978; Hozumi and Tonegawa, 1976; Maki et al., 1980; Tonegawa, 1983 ). At later stages of differentiation, directed hypermutation of the V region exon further increases the natural diversity of VL domains ( Feige et al., 2010; Jung and Alt, 2004; Li et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 1998 ). As a result, each AL amyloidosis patient possesses a different set of somatic mutations and hence a unique disease-responsible LC sequence ( Blancas-Mej\u00eda et al., 2015 ). These mutations often destabilize patient LCs compared to non-amyloidogenic LCs. The destabilization was linked to amyloid fibril formation propensity ( Baden et al., 2008; Blancas-Mej\u00eda et al., 2015; Hurle et al., 1994; Raffen et al., 1999; Ramirez-Alvarado, 2012; Wall et al., 1999 ). Even though full length LCs and other proteins have recently been found as part of fibrils, patient biopsies predominantly revealed VL domains that result from proteolytic cleavage of the LC as the main constituent of amyloid deposits ( Blancas-Mej\u00eda et al., 2015; Buxbaum, 1986; Enqvist et al., 2009; Gallo et al., 1996; Glenner et al., 1970; Hurle et al., 1994; Nokwe et al., 2014; Pepys, 2006; Simpson et al., 2009 ). Partial unfolding of the pathogenic VLs leads to exposed residue segments that entail the stacking capability of the domain, leading to the tightly packed, dehydrated cross-\u03b2 amyloid fibril structure ( Annamalai et al., 2016; Brumshtein et al., 2018; Kelly, 1998; Merlini and Bellotti, 2003 ). However, changes in stability alone cannot explain the differences in fibril formation propensity ( Nokwe et al., 2014 ). Since every patient suffers from a unique LC, it is generally not clear which of the mutated residues trigger the disease. Thus, the underlying reason for VL variants in AL patients is still largely enigmatic and the mechanistic principles need to be defined. In this study, we analyzed a patient-derived amyloidogenic LC truncation of the \u03bb subtype with a view to determine the mechanism that renders it pathogenic. The patient variant ( referred to as Pat-1 ) contains 11 mutations in the VL domain compared to the corresponding germline sequence ( referred to as WT-1 ). A comparison of mutant and germline VL regarding their structure, stability and amyloid formation propensity allowed us to identify the key mutation responsible for amyloidogenicity and to elucidate its effects on conformational dynamics that result in fibril formation.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Amyloid light chain amyloidosis, shortened to AL amyloidosis, is a rare and often fatal disease. It is caused by a disorder of the bone marrow. Usually, cells in the bone marrow produce Y-shaped proteins called antibodies to fight infections. In AL amyloidosis, these cells release too much of the short arm of the antibody, known as its light chain, and the light chains also carry mutations. The antibodies are no longer able to assemble properly, and instead misfold and form structures, known as amyloid fibrils. The fibrils build up outside the cells, gradually causing damage to tissues and organs that can lead to life-threatening organ failure. Due to the rareness of the disease, diagnosis is often overlooked and delayed. People experience widely varying symptoms, depending on the organs affected. Also, given the diversity of antibodies people make, every person with AL amyloidosis has a variety of mutations implicated in their disease. It is thought that mutations in the antibody light chain make it unstable and prone to misfolding, but it remains unclear which specific mutations trigger a cascade of amyloid fibril formation. Now, Kazman et al. have pinpointed the exact mechanism in one case of the disease. First, tissue biopsies from a woman with advanced AL amyloidosis were analyzed, and the defunct antibody light chain was isolated. Eleven mutations were identified in the antibody light chain, only one of which was found to be responsible for the formation of the harmful fibrils. The next step was to determine how this one small change was so damaging. The experiments showed that after the antibody light chain was cut in two, a process that happens naturally in the body, this single mutation transforms it into a protein capable of causing disease. In this \u2018bedside to lab bench\u2019 study, Kazman et al. have succeeded in determining the molecular origin of one case of AL amyloidosis. The results have also shown that the instability of antibodies due to mutation does not alone explain the formation of amyloid fibrils in this disease and that the cutting of this protein in two is also important. It is hoped that, in the long run, this work will lead to new diagnostics and treatment options for people with AL amyloidosis ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nThe brain is capable of large-scale reorganization in blindness or after massive injury. Such reorganization crosses the division into separate sensory cortices ( visual, somatosensory. .. ). As its result, the visual cortex of the blind becomes active during tactile Braille reading. Although the possibility of such reorganization in the normal, adult brain has been raised, definitive evidence has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate such extensive reorganization in normal, sighted adults who learned Braille while their brain activity was investigated with fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ). Subjects showed enhanced activity for tactile reading in the visual cortex, including the visual word form area ( VWFA ) that was modulated by their Braille reading speed and strengthened resting-state connectivity between visual and somatosensory cortices. Moreover, TMS disruption of VWFA activity decreased their tactile reading accuracy. Our results indicate that large-scale reorganization is a viable mechanism recruited when learning complex skills.  The current view of neural plasticity in the adult brain sees it as ubiquitous but generally constrained by functional boundaries ( Hoffman and Logothetis, 2009 ). At the systems level, experience-driven plasticity is thought to operate within the limits of sensory divisions, where the visual cortex processes visual stimuli and responds to visual training, the tactile cortex processes tactile stimuli and responds to tactile training, and so on. A departure from this rule is usually reported only during large-scale reorganization induced by sensory loss or injury ( Hirsch et al., 2015; Lomber et al., 2011; Merabet and Pascual-Leone, 2010; Pavani and Roder, 2012 ). The ventral visual cortex, in particular, is activated in blind subjects who read Braille ( B\u00fcchel et al., 1998; Reich et al., 2011; Sadato et al., 2002, 1996 ) and lesions of this area impair Braille reading ( Hamilton et al., 2000 ). This visual cortex thus has the innate connectivity required to carry out a complex perceptual task \u2013 reading \u2013 in a modality different than vision. It is unclear, however, to what extent this connectivity is preserved and functional in the normal, adult brain. A growing amount of evidence suggests that some form of cross-modal recruitment of the visual cortex could be possible in the normal healthy adults ( Amedi et al., 2007; Kim and Zatorre, 2011; Powers et al., 2012; Saito et al., 2006; Zangenehpour and Zatorre, 2010; Merabet et al., 2004; Zangaladze et al., 1999 ). Nonetheless, the behavioural relevance of these cortical mechanisms remains unclear, especially for complex stimuli. Notably, several experiments failed to find such cross-modal reorganization in sighted subjects, even after extensive training ( Kupers et al., 2006; Ptito et al., 2005 ). One study found cross-modal plastic changes in subjects that were blindfolded for several days ( Merabet et al., 2008 ), but these plastic changes quickly vanished once the subjects removed their blindfolds. Here, for the first time, we show that large-scale, cross-modal cortical reorganization is a viable, adaptive mechanism in the sighted, adult brain. In our experiment, sighted adults followed a 9-month Braille reading course. The resulting cortical changes were tracked using task-based and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) and manipulated with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: According to most textbooks, our brain is divided into separate areas that are dedicated to specific senses. We have a visual cortex for vision, a tactile cortex for touch, and so on. However, researchers suspect that this division might not be as fixed as the textbooks say. For example, blind people can switch their 'leftover' visual cortex to non-visual purposes, such as reading Braille \u2013 a tactile alphabet. Can this switch in functional organization also happen in healthy people with normal vision ? To investigate this, Siuda-Krzywicka, Bola et al. taught a group of healthy, sighted people to read Braille by touch, and monitored the changes in brain activity that this caused using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging. According to textbooks, tactile reading should engage the tactile cortex. Yet, the experiment revealed that the brain activity critical for reading Braille by touch did not occur in the volunteers\u2019 tactile cortex, but in their visual cortex. Further experiments used a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation to suppress the activity of the visual cortex of the volunteers. This impaired their ability to read Braille by touch. This is a clear-cut proof that sighted adults can re-program their visual cortex for non-visual, tactile purposes. These results show that intensive training in a complex task can overcome the sensory division-of-labor of our brain. This indicates that our brain is much more flexible than previously thought, and that such flexibility might occur when we learn everyday, complex skills such as driving a car or playing a musical instrument. The next question that follows from this work is: what enables the brain\u2019s activity to change after learning to read Braille ? To understand this, Siuda-Krzywicka, Bola et al. are currently exploring how the physical structure of the brain changes as a result of a person acquiring the ability to read Braille by touch ."}

Here, we show how Pacific parrotlets exhibit stereotyped leg and wing dynamics regardless of perch diameter and texture, but foot, toe, and claw kinematics become surface-specific upon touchdown. A new dynamic grasping model, which integrates our detailed measurements, reveals how birds stabilize their grasp. They combine predictable toe pad friction with probabilistic friction from their claws, which they drag to find surface asperities\u2014dragging further when they can squeeze less. Remarkably, parrotlet claws can undergo superfast movements, within 1\u20132 ms, on moderately slippery surfaces to find more secure asperities when necessary. With this strategy, they first ramp up safety margins by squeezing before relaxing their grasp. The model further shows it is advantageous to be small for stable perching when high friction relative to normal force is required because claws can find more usable surface, but this trend reverses when required friction shrinks. This explains how many animals and robots may grasp complex surfaces reliably.  While airplanes require runways and most aerial robots need flat landing areas, arboreal birds consistently land on perches with a wide range of geometries and surface properties. Recent advances in perching capabilities of aerial robots have improved their landing ability on engineered surfaces. However, they still lack the versatility and robustness that birds exhibit when landing on an extraordinarily wide range of complex engineered and natural surfaces ( Kovac, 2016; Roderick et al., 2017a; Doyle et al., 2013 ). Previous studies have quantified leg and wing dynamics ( Provini et al., 2012; Provini et al., 2014; Chin and Lentink, 2017; Provini and Abourachid, 2018 ) and suggested visual control strategies ( Chin and Lentink, 2017; Lee et al., 1993 ) that arboreal birds use during landings. However, it is unclear whether the same findings would apply with perches that have different geometric properties and challenging surface textures. Even less is understood at the actual interface between the bird\u2019s foot and the perch surface. While previous studies have examined the morphology of bird feet in cadavers ( Hopson, 2001; Sustaita et al., 2013 ) and claw shape in relation to body size and lifestyle ( Pike and Maitland, 1999; Birn-Jeffery et al., 2012; Feduccia, 1993 ), no in vivo studies quantify toe forces during grasping or how claws actually interact with perch surface features. Consequently, we do not know how birds actually grasp perches so reliably in a seemingly effortless manner. To elucidate the mechanisms and strategies responsible for the versatile perching capabilities of arboreal birds, we studied voluntary landings made by Pacific parrotlets ( Forpus coelestis ) on perches with different geometries and textures ( Video 1 ). We tested nine landing perch variations in total, which included three natural variations, three diameter variations, and three man-made surface variations ( Figure 1a ). The natural perches were constructed from\u00a0~0. 75\" ( 19 mm ) diameter branches from three different trees. The first tree was a Coast Live Oak ( Quercus agrifolia ), which varies in roughness at different parts of its branches. The second was a Floss-Silk tree ( Ceiba speciosa ), which has relatively smooth, soft branches and is native to the same forests of Ecuador and Peru ( Nasr et al., 2018 ) as the Pacific parrotlets. The third was a Sweet Olive tree ( Osmanthus fragrans ), which has rough, striated branches. Birch dowels, which are commonly used for commercial bird housing perches ( our parrotlet housing uses 0. 625\"-dia. birch dowels ), were used to construct the three diameter variations: 1. 5\" ( 38 mm ), too large for the parrotlets to wrap their feet more than a quarter of the way around; 0. 75\" ( 19 mm ), which their feet can wrap about halfway around; and 0. 25\" ( 6 mm ), which their front and rear toes wrap around completely and overlap. To test surface texture extremes, three 0. 75\" diameter perches were constructed by wrapping birch wooden dowels in foam ( squishy ), Teflon ( slippery ), and sandpaper ( rough ). To characterize the surface properties of these perches, we made 3D structured-light scans to quantify roughness ( Supplementary file 1A ) and reconstruct surface profiles ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ). The profiles show the variation in surface roughness, from smoothest, Teflon, to roughest, sandpaper ( Figure 1A ). To evaluate the effect of these properties on foot-surface interactions, we conducted toe and claw drag tests to measure friction forces on each surface. We also performed claw indentation tests to measure surface deformation ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods; Figure 1B ). Finally, we made high-speed recordings of parrotlets landing on the nine different perches. The perches were split in half and instrumented on a pair of force/torque sensors for measuring net and squeeze forces exerted by their feet ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods; Figure 1C ).  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Most of the flying vehicles designed by humans need to land on smooth, standardized surfaces such as runways. A bird, on the other hand, can use structures that vary widely in diameter and texture, from phone lines to branches to statues. Yet, few studies have focused on how these animals transition from the air to a perch, and especially on how they adapt to different surfaces. To fill this gap, Roderick, Chin et al. recorded how Pacific parrotlets landed on nine natural and man-made perches that varied in diameter and texture, ranging from smooth Teflon to rough sandpaper. High-speed cameras tracked each of the landings while sensors measured how hard the birds landed on and squeezed the perches. The experiments revealed that the first landing phase was the same regardless of the nature of the perch. The birds used their wings to slow down, unfurled their feet and claws in preparation for touchdown and then allowed their legs to absorb the landing impact. Once the feet had made contact with the surface, however, the birds used their toes and claws to adapt to different perches. First, they steadied their grasp by tightly squeezing the perches. Then, the parrotlets dragged their claws on the surface of the perches to find minuscule bumps and dips that allowed better stabilization. These movements could be remarkably fast \u2013 in the range of one to two milliseconds. The birds also curled their claws more on perches that were harder to grasp. Once secured on the branch, they relaxed their grip. The results by Roderick, Chin et al. will help biologists understand how birds, insects and even large tree-dwelling creatures can grab perches in various environments. This knowledge will also be relevant for engineers who are trying to create robots that can climb or land on diverse surfaces ."}

How the components of this system work together to generate translocation force and directional motion remains uncertain. Here, we combine biochemical approaches, quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling to examine the mechanism by which ParA drives the translocation of the ParB/parS partition complex in Caulobacter crescentus. Our experiments, together with simulations grounded on experimentally-determined biochemical and cellular parameters, suggest a novel 'DNA-relay' mechanism in which the chromosome plays a mechanical function. In this model, DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers serve as transient tethers that harness the elastic dynamics of the chromosome to relay the partition complex from one DNA region to another across a ParA-ATP dimer gradient. Since ParA-like proteins are implicated in the partitioning of various cytoplasmic cargos, the conservation of their DNA-binding activity suggests that the DNA-relay mechanism may be a general form of intracellular transport in bacteria.  Perpetuation of life depends on the faithful segregation of genetic material upon division, such that each progeny inherits a full complement of the parental genome. In eukaryotic cells, chromosome segregation is driven by the microtubule-based mitotic spindle in a process for which there is considerable mechanistic understanding ( McIntosh et al., 2012 ). In contrast, much less is known in bacteria. Yet a robust segregation mechanism must be in place to keep up with the fast-paced proliferation of bacterial cells. Such segregation mechanism is also critical for maintaining the precise organization of the chromosome and the reproducible positioning of gene loci over generations ( Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013 ). Recent studies on various bacteria have shown that chromosome segregation is a multi-step process that initiates with the segregation of the duplicated chromosomal origin regions shortly following their replication ( Shebelut et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013 ). How the newly replicated chromosomal origin regions segregate remains poorly understood. In recent years, the ParABS systems, which are conserved among most bacterial species ( Livny et al., 2007 ), have been recognized as important active transport systems of chromosomal origin regions in diverse bacteria ( Mohl and Gober, 1997; Kim et al., 2000; Godfrin-Estevenon et al., 2002; Lewis et al., 2002; Fogel and Waldor, 2006; Saint-Dic et al., 2006; Lasocki et al., 2007; Jakimowicz et al., 2007a, 2007b; Toro et al., 2008; Bartosik et al., 2009; Donovan et al., 2010; Ptacin et al., 2010; Schofield et al., 2010; Shebelut et al., 2010; Harms et al., 2013; Iniesta, 2014 ). ParABS systems, first identified on plasmids for their role in stable plasmid inheritance ( Austin and Abeles, 1983 ), consist of three components: the DNA sequence parS, the DNA-binding protein ParB, and the deviant Walker A-type ATPase ParA ( Ebersbach and Gerdes, 2005 ). ParB specifically recognizes parS sequences, which are typically found near the origin of replication of most bacterial chromosomes ( Livny et al., 2007 ). Upon binding to parS, ParB is thought to spread on flanking sequences to form the so-called ParB/parS partition complex ( Rodionov et al., 1999; Murray et al., 2006; Breier and Grossman, 2007 ). ParA dimerizes upon ATP binding, which in turn promotes nonspecific DNA binding ( Leonard et al., 2005; Hester and Lutkenhaus, 2007 ). Various in vitro studies have also observed that ParA-ATP dimers can further assemble into filaments ( Barilla et al., 2005; Ebersbach et al., 2006; Barilla et al., 2007; Machon et al., 2007; Ptacin et al., 2010 ). By itself, ParA has a weak ATPase activity but this activity is generally stimulated by an interaction with ParB ( Davis et al., 1992; Easter and Gober, 2002; Leonard et al., 2005; Barilla et al., 2007; Ah-Seng et al., 2009; Scholefield et al., 2011 ). While these biochemical properties have been documented for many ParABS systems, how they give rise to directional transport remains a hot topic of debate ( Howard and Gerdes, 2010; Szardenings et al., 2011; Vecchiarelli et al., 2012 ). ParABS-mediated chromosomal segregation has probably been most studied in Caulobacter crescentus where ParA and ParB are essential for viability ( Mohl and Gober, 1997 ). In this bacterium, the single, densely packed circular chromosome spans the entire cell and is spatially arranged such that the ParB/parS partition complex and the nearby replication origin are located at the \u2018old\u2019 cell pole while the replication terminus is localized at the opposite, \u2018new\u2019 pole ( Jensen and Shapiro, 1999 ). Epifluorescence microscopy studies in live cells have shown that prior to DNA replication, ParA forms a cloud-like localization pattern that spans from the new pole to about midcell ( Ptacin et al., 2010; Schofield et al., 2010; Shebelut et al., 2010 ). Replication of the origin region results in two physically separated copies of the ParB/parS complex. The ParB/parS complex closer to the old pole remains there while the other one, upon contact with the edge of the ParA cloud, migrates toward the new pole in the wake of the receding ParA cloud, as if retraction of ParA was \u2018pulling\u2019 the partition complex ( Ptacin et al., 2010; Schofield et al., 2010; Shebelut et al., 2010 ). This correlated spatial dynamics between ParA and ParB/parS is a common characteristic of ParABS systems involved in chromosome or plasmid partitioning ( Ebersbach et al., 2006; Fogel and Waldor, 2006; Hatano et al., 2007; Ringgaard et al., 2009; Harms et al., 2013; Iniesta, 2014 ). The physical mechanism that underlies this correlated dynamics is generally thought to be analogous to the eukaryotic spindle-based mechanism that segregates chromosomes during mitosis ( Gerdes et al., 2010 ). According to this popular spindle-like model, ParA polymerizes into a thin filament bundle upon ATP binding. Depolymerization of ParA filaments through ParB-induced ATP hydrolysis then pulls the ParB/parS complex and its associated chromosomal origin region. However, the significance of ParA DNA-binding activity remains unclear, even though this activity is essential for the segregation process based on mutational analysis ( Hester and Lutkenhaus, 2007; Castaing et al., 2008; Ptacin et al., 2010; Schofield et al., 2010 ). Recent in vitro studies have proposed an alternative \u2018Brownian-ratchet\u2019 mechanism for the partitioning of P1 and F plasmids ( Vecchiarelli et al., 2010; Vecchiarelli et al., 2012, 2013, 2014; Hwang et al., 2013 ). However, it is unclear whether the proposed mechanism can support plasmid translocation under physiological conditions. Apart from chromosome and plasmid segregation, ParA-like proteins have been implicated in the positioning of other cellular components such as metabolic microcompartments and cytosolic chemotaxis clusters ( Savage et al., 2010; Ringgaard et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2012 ), highlighting the versatility of the ParABS systems. Interestingly, while the chromosomally encoded Bacillus subtilis ParA ( Soj ) and ParB ( Spo0J ) orthologs have been implicated in chromosome partitioning in sporulating cells ( Ireton et al., 1994; Sharpe and Errington, 1996; Wu and Errington, 2003; Lee and Grossman, 2006 ), they are involved in the regulation of DNA replication in vegetative cells ( Murray and Errington, 2008 ). B. subtilis Spo0J binds to parS sites proximal to the origin of replication similar to ParB orthologs involved in chromosome segregation ( Lin et al., 1997; Lin and Grossman, 1998; Murray et al., 2006 ). Like ParA proteins involved in cargo partitioning, Soj forms ATP-dependent dimers that bind DNA in vitro ( Scholefield et al., 2011 ) and display nucleoid-associated localization in cells lacking Spo0J ( Murray and Errington, 2008 ). However, in wild-type cells, Soj mostly displays a diffuse distribution in the B. subtilis cytoplasm ( with a weak accumulation at the Spo0J/parS location ) ( Murray and Errington, 2008 ). This pattern is in stark contrast to the cloud-like localization pattern characteristic of ParA orthologs dedicated to cargo transport. Why ParA localization in B. subtilis differs remains enigmatic. In this study, we combined biochemical and cell biological experiments with computational modeling to investigate how the ParABS system drives chromosomal segregation in C. crescentus. Our findings are inconsistent with a spindle-like or Brownian ratchet mechanism. Rather, our experiments and simulations support a novel physical mechanism in which chromosome dynamics and the rate of ATP hydrolysis are critical for efficient and robust ParA-dependent translocation of the ParB/parS complex. Our data also suggest that the difference in localization and possibly function between B. subtilis Soj and C. crescentus ParA can be explained by a biochemical difference in ParB's ability to stimulate ParA ATPase activity.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: DNA molecules exist in cells as tightly packed structures called chromosomes. During the cell cycle, chromosomes duplicate, and the two copies separate, ready to end up in two separate daughter cells. The process of chromosome separation in cells of higher organisms such as animals and plants is well understood. A protein-based structure called the spindle apparatus guides the separating chromosomes to different ends of the dividing cell. However, how chromosome separation occurs in bacteria is not well understood despite its importance in bacterial multiplication. The nucleoprotein complex ParABS is critical for separating chromosomes in bacteria. The complex is made up of three parts: parS, a stretch of DNA located at the point where chromosome duplication begins; and two proteins called ParB and ParA. While the molecular players are known, how they work together to separate chromosomes is under debate. One popular suggestion is that ParA forms a spindle-like structure. Alternatively, a diffusion-based mechanism has been proposed, where a gradient of ParA molecules bound to the chromosome interacts with a parS/ParB complex, directing the diffusion of the complex. Lim et al. used quantitative microscopy to observe the movement of the parS/ParB complex and the spatial distribution of the ParA proteins in a model bacterium. The results were inconsistent with the presence of a spindle-like structure in the cells. A mathematical model describing chromosome movement\u2014based on the number and activity of ParA and ParB found in live cells\u2014also failed to fit with either the spindle or the diffusion theory. Instead, Lim et al. propose a new model, based on the discovery that chromosomes are elastic. In this \u2018DNA-relay model\u2019, ParA is bound to DNA. When ParB intermittently binds to ParA, it usually catches the ParA-DNA complex when the complex is elastically stretched. The elasticity of the chromosome itself then makes the parS/ParB complex move in the direction where the most ParA molecules are still bound to the chromosome. Lim et al. suggest that similar elastic mechanisms could also be behind more general intracellular transport in bacteria ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nUltradian ( \u223c4 hr ) rhythms in locomotor activity that do not depend on the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus have been observed across mammalian species, however, the underlying mechanisms driving these rhythms are unknown. We show that disruption of the dopamine transporter gene lengthens the period of ultradian locomotor rhythms in mice. Period lengthening also results from chemogenetic activation of midbrain dopamine neurons and psychostimulant treatment, while the antipsychotic haloperidol has the opposite effect. We further reveal that striatal dopamine levels fluctuate in synchrony with ultradian activity cycles and that dopaminergic tone strongly predicts ultradian period. Our data indicate that an arousal regulating, dopaminergic ultradian oscillator ( DUO ) operates in the mammalian brain, which normally cycles in harmony with the circadian clock, but can desynchronize when dopamine tone is elevated, thereby producing aberrant patterns of arousal which are strikingly similar to perturbed sleep-wake cycles comorbid with psychopathology.  Ultradian rhythms with periods ranging from one to several hours have been linked to various aspects of mammalian physiology. Usually superimposed on the 24-hr diurnal or circadian rhythm, ultradian oscillations have been observed in the context of locomotion, sleep, feeding, body temperature, serum hormones, and brain monoamines in species ranging from fruit flies to humans ( Tannenbaum and Martin, 1976; Ibuka et al., 1977; Rusak, 1977; Daan and Slopsema, 1978; Honma and Hiroshige, 1978; Dowse et al., 1987; Rivkees, 2003; van Oort et al., 2007; Dowse et al., 2010; Seki and Tanimura, 2014 ). These physiological cycles most frequently exhibit periods of 2\u20136 hr, adopting harmonics of the 24-hr daily light\u2013dark cycle or the endogenous circadian rhythm, when external timing cues are absent. However, the generation of such ultradian rhythms does not depend on a functional circadian system nor a light:dark cycle. Ultradian locomotor oscillations persist in rodents housed in constant darkness even upon ablation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ), the site of the master circadian pacemaker ( Ibuka et al., 1977; Rusak, 1977 ), or genetic disruption of the circadian clock ( Vitaterna et al., 1994; Bunger et al., 2000 ) ( Figure 1A, B ). These ultradian activity cycles may not simply be driven by metabolic demand since the 2- to 3-hr rhythm in foraging activity observed in the common vole persists even in the absence of food ( Gerkema and van der Leest, 1991 ). Studies in this species further indicate that one adaptive value of ultradian activity rhythms may lie in the facilitation of social synchrony, which is suggested to reduce predator risk in this species ( Gerkema and Verhulst, 1990 ). However, despite their prevalence and hypothesized biological significance, ultradian locomotor rhythms have received little research attention, likely owing to their frequently masked expression and unstable periodicity in contrast with circadian activity rhythms ( Ruis et al., 1987; Schibler, 2008 ) ( Figure 1C, D ). 10. 7554/eLife. 05105. 003Figure 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 05105. 003 In addition to ultradian oscillations, methamphetamine-induced rhythms of locomotor activity occur in the absence of a functional circadian clock. When provided in the drinking water, methamphetamines ( Meth ) induce a daily activity bout in addition to the expected circadian rhythm ( Honma et al., 1986 ). This Meth-dependent component\u2014which typically adopts a period in the circadian range\u2014is not abolished upon SCN lesion nor by genetic disruption of circadian clock function ( Honma et al., 1987; Mohawk et al., 2009 ). It was thus concluded that a methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator ( MASCO ) outside the SCN exists which is capable of driving daily cycles of locomotor activity ( Tataroglu et al., 2006 ). Despite the longstanding recognition of ultradian and Meth-dependent rhythms, the underlying cellular and molecular identity of the oscillator ( s ) driving them is unknown. Here, we provide evidence for a highly tunable dopaminergic ultradian oscillator ( DUO ) which is continuously operative in the mammalian brain and which, together with the circadian clock, orchestrates the daily pattern of arousal. Our data suggest that dopamine acts as both the principal oscillator output as well as an integral component of the DUO, determining oscillator period. Our findings further indicate that the previously described MASCO represents a long-period manifestation of the DUO resulting from elevated dopamine tone. Importantly, our data support an intriguing proposition: that DUO, rather than circadian clock, dysregulation critically contributes to the sleep-wake abnormalities associated with psychopathology.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: The sleep-wake cycle of mammals is controlled by a \u2018circadian clock\u2019 within the brain, which is synchronized to the day\u2013night cycle. However, other aspects of mammalian physiology including alertness and activity levels, as well as appetite and body temperature\u2014fluctuate in cycles that repeat every few hours. These cycles are known as ultradian rhythms, and they may offer survival benefits by enabling potentially risky behaviors, such as foraging, to be coordinated between members of a group. Despite their widespread nature and the fact that they appear to be conserved in evolution, virtually nothing is known about the molecular basis of ultradian rhythms. Blum et al. have now identified a second internal clock within the brain, which they name \u2018the DUO\u2019, and shown that this clock normally works in concert with the circadian clock to regulate daily patterns of activity and alertness. Experiments in mice revealed that the DUO uses the brain chemical dopamine to generate bursts of activity roughly every four hours. Moreover, it continues to work when the circadian clock has been destroyed. Measurements of dopamine in freely moving mice showed that levels of the chemical fluctuate in synchrony with the animals' activity levels. Moreover, drugs that flood the brain with dopamine, such as methamphetamine, disrupt the 4-hour cycle by lengthening the period between bursts of activity, whereas drugs that block dopamine receptors have the opposite effect. As well as revealing a mechanism by which the brain coordinates processes that repeat several times per day, the identification of the DUO could also provide insights into the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. Conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are often accompanied by disturbances in patterns of activity and rest. While these have previously been attributed to the disruption of circadian rhythms, there is little direct evidence for this, which raises the possibility that these changes might instead reflect the disruption of ultradian rhythms ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nPioneering work with nonhuman primates and recent human studies established intracortical microstimulation ( ICMS ) in primary somatosensory cortex ( S1 ) as a method of inducing discriminable artificial sensation. However, these artificial sensations do not yet provide the breadth of cutaneous and proprioceptive percepts available through natural stimulation. In a tetraplegic human with two microelectrode arrays implanted in S1, we report replicable elicitations of sensations in both the cutaneous and proprioceptive modalities localized to the contralateral arm, dependent on both amplitude and frequency of stimulation. Furthermore, we found a subset of electrodes that exhibited multimodal properties, and that proprioceptive percepts on these electrodes were associated with higher amplitudes, irrespective of the frequency. These novel results demonstrate the ability to provide naturalistic percepts through ICMS that can more closely mimic the body\u2019s natural physiological capabilities. Furthermore, delivering both cutaneous and proprioceptive sensations through artificial somatosensory feedback could improve performance and embodiment in brain-machine interfaces.  The absence of somatosensation profoundly diminishes a person\u2019s ability to move and interact within their environment ( Cole and Cole, 1995; Sainburg et al., 1993 ). Even with intact vision and hearing, which can provide sensory information about body position, movement, and interaction, basic behaviors such as walking or reach-and-grasp require substantially greater cognitive load without somatosensory feedback. The severity of these deficits underscores how deeply integrated cutaneous and proprioceptive somatosensations are in the neural control of movement, and motivates the problem of restoring sensation when it is missing. However, the complexity of the somatosensory circuit, and the difficulty of writing information into this circuit with sufficient integrity, have posed significant challenges. Recent advances in brain-machine interface ( BMI ) technology have led to renewed efforts in this area, under the hypothesis that providing closed-loop motor-sensory control and feedback pathways could lead to vital increases in performance ( Bensmaia and Miller, 2014 ). Intracortical microstimulation ( ICMS ) is a promising technique for implementing a return path in which electrical stimuli are written directly into the somatosensory cortex through implanted electrode arrays. Non-human primates ( NHPs ) successfully incorporated ICMS information to perform discrimination, detection tasks ( Romo et al., 1998; Romo et al., 2000; Tabot et al., 2013; Dadarlat et al., 2015 ) and as sensory feedback for brain control in BMI tasks ( O'Doherty et al., 2011; Klaes et al., 2014 ), and recent human studies have provided insight into the feeling and perception of the sensations produced through ICMS ( Flesher et al., 2016 ). However, qualities ascribed by human subjects to these sensations ( e. g., \u2018tingling\u2019 or \u2018buzzing\u2019 ) have been mostly artificial in nature ( Johnson et al., 2013; Flesher et al., 2016 ), and it is as yet unclear what range of sensations could be elicited through ICMS. Here, we present novel findings from two experiments: one which tested each electrode over a range of amplitudes with fixed frequency, and one which tested a subset of electrodes over a range of amplitudes and frequencies. We found reliable elicitation of natural cutaneous and proprioceptive sensations spanning a range of stimulus amplitudes and frequencies, obtained from stimulation in S1 of a single human subject ( participant FG, Figure 1; see Materials and methods ) with a C5-level spinal cord injury. We further show that current amplitude, not frequency, of the electrical stimulus differentiates the modality ( i. e., cutaneous or proprioceptive ) of the elicited percept at some stimulation sites.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Nerves throughout the body send information about touch, temperature, body position and pain through the spinal cord to the brain. A part of the brain called the somatosensory cortex processes this information. Spinal cord injuries disrupt these messages. Even though the somatosensory cortex has not been damaged, sensation is lost for the affected body areas. No treatment exists to repair the spinal cord so the loss of sensation is permanent. Applying electricity to the somatosensory cortex can produce artificial sensations. Scientists are testing this approach to restore a sense of touch for people with spinal cord injury. Early experiments show that using different patterns of electrical stimulation generates unnatural sensations in different body parts. People receiving the stimulation describe it as tingling or shocks. Scientists wonder if they can improve the technique to mimic feelings like touch or body position to make it easier for people with a spinal injury to move or use prostheses. Now, Armenta Salas et al. generated more natural sensations in a person with a spinal cord injury. Instead of taking the usual approach of delivering large currents to the surface of cortex, they inserted small electrodes into the inside of the cortex to stimulate it with small currents. In the experiments, electrodes were implanted in the somatosensory cortex of a volunteer who had lost the use of his limbs and torso because of a spinal injury. Armenta Salas et al. applied different patterns of electrical stimuli and the volunteer reported what they felt like. The patient described sensations like a pinch or squeeze in the forearm or upper arm with certain patterns. In some cases, the patient reported the sensation of the arm moving with stronger electrical currents. The experiments show that electrical stimulation of the brain can recreate some natural sensations. These sensations could help patients using robotic or prosthetic arms become more dexterous. It might also help patients view artificial limbs as part of their bodies, which could improve their sense of wellbeing ."}

Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nDynamic instability, polarity, and spatiotemporal organization are hallmarks of the microtubule cytoskeleton that allow formation of complex structures such as the eukaryotic spindle. No similar structure has been identified in prokaryotes. The bacteriophage-encoded tubulin PhuZ is required to position DNA at mid-cell, without which infectivity is compromised. Here, we show that PhuZ filaments, like microtubules, stochastically switch from growing in a distinctly polar manner to catastrophic depolymerization ( dynamic instability ) both in vitro and in vivo. One end of each PhuZ filament is stably anchored near the cell pole to form a spindle-like array that orients the growing ends toward the phage nucleoid so as to position it near mid-cell. Our results demonstrate how a bacteriophage can harness the properties of a tubulin-like cytoskeleton for efficient propagation. This represents the first identification of a prokaryotic tubulin with the dynamic instability of microtubules and the ability to form a simplified bipolar spindle.  Tubulins are universally conserved GTPases that polymerize in a head to tail fashion to form filaments. They have evolved properties that allow them to assemble into a wide variety of structures with various functions and dynamics. In eukaryotes, \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin forms large, dynamically unstable microtubules ( MTs ), composed of 13 protofilaments ( Downing and Nogales, 1998 ). MTs are the essential component of many cell biological processes; one of the most familiar and well studied is the mitotic spindle required for the faithful segregation of sister chromatids in all eukaryotic cells. MTs have a distinct growth polarity in which growing ( plus ) ends elongate substantially faster than minus ends ( Allen and Borisy, 1974; Downing and Nogales, 1998 ). They are often anchored by their minus ends at specific locations in the cell known as microtubule organizing centers to facilitate mitosis, directional transport, and motility. This anchoring significantly stabilizes the MTs and lends a consistent organization to these structures ( Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984b ). The polarity of the filament becomes key in its ability to specifically interact with binding partners, such as the kinetochore, and for the regulation of the filaments by microtubule accessory proteins ( MAPs ) ( Euteneuer and McIntosh, 1981; Kitamura et al., 2010 ). These two features allow for the rapid and effective search and capture of the sister chromatids by the MTs via dynamic instability. Dynamic instability is defined as the stochastic switching between states of polymerization and rapid depolymerization ( Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984a ). The biomechanical source of this dynamic instability is the differential between the addition of new monomers into the MT lattice and the hydrolysis of the GTP bound to the beta subunit of the heterodimer. While GTP bound to the subunits in the middle of the lattice has been hydrolyzed to GDP, the tip of the growing MT is crowned by a cap of GTP-bound heterodimers ( Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984a ). The loss of this GTP cap facilitates a conformational change in the filaments, subsequent depolymerization and, possibly, catastrophe ( Downing and Nogales, 1998 ). Until now, these properties of tubulins have appeared to be unique hallmarks of eukaryotes. Some plasmid encoded bacterial actins, such as ParM and Alp7A, display dynamic instability ( Garner et al., 2004; Derman et al., 2009 ) ; however, unlike MTs, ParM filaments elongate bidirectionally ( Garner et al., 2004 ) and assemble only transiently during the relatively brief process of pushing plasmid DNA molecules apart ( Campbell and Mullins, 2007 ). Furthermore, they are not spatially organized and assemble at random positions in the cell. Several families of bacterial tubulins have been identified that participate in cell division, DNA segregation, and viral DNA positioning ( Larsen et al., 2007; Oliva et al., 2012; Meier and Goley, 2014 ). While TubZ has been shown to treadmill ( Larsen et al., 2007 ), for most other prokaryotic tubulins, the type of motion the filament undergoes in vivo remains unclear. None of the bacterial tubulins have been shown to exhibit dynamic instability or other critical properties of a microtubule-based spindle. We recently identified a family of bacteriophage tubulins, PhuZ, that play a role in spatially organizing DNA during lytic growth and thereby contribute to efficient phage production ( Kraemer et al., 2012 ). PhuZ from Pseudomonas chlororaphis phage 201\u03d52-1 contains a tubulin fold and an extended C-terminus that forms extensive longitudinal and lateral contacts required to stabilize a unique triple stranded filament ( Kraemer et al., 2012; Zehr et al., 2014 ). Catalytically defective PhuZ mutants lacking GTPase activity generate stable filaments and disrupt correct positioning of clusters of DNA during lytic growth ( Kraemer et al., 2012 ). While this suggested the importance of filament dynamics, it has remained unclear how PhuZ polymers might facilitate this organization. Here we present the first example of a prokaryotic tubulin that undergoes dynamic instability both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the PhuZ cytoskeleton has many of the properties of eukaryotic MTs, including polarity, a GTP cap, and anchoring. These shared properties extend to the ability of both PhuZ and MTs to build a bipolar spindle for the movement of DNA. We further characterize replication of this bacteriophage, demonstrating that the infection nucleoid contains only replicating phage DNA and that nucleoid centering is independent of replication.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: For a cell or virus to reproduce, it must duplicate its genome and separate the two copies. In plants and animals, this DNA is stored in the nucleus of each cell in the form of chromosomes, and a complex protein structure called the spindle apparatus is responsible for physically aligning and then separating the duplicated chromosomes. The spindle apparatus is mainly built from a group of proteins called tubulin, which join together end-to-end to form fibers called microtubules. Proteins that interact with the fibers link them to the chromosomes or to one of the two \u2018poles\u2019 that sit on opposite sides of the cell. Tubulin proteins are then rapidly added to, or removed from, the other end of the microtubule, lengthening or shortening the structure. The rapid switch between fiber growth and shortening is known as dynamic instability. As these fibers shrink, they pull the pair of chromosomes apart and towards opposite sides of the cell. Viruses that infect bacteria ( bacteriophages, or phages for short ) replicate their DNA by invading a bacterial cell and hijacking its DNA-replication machinery. In contrast to animals and plants, bacterial cells do not have a cell nucleus, and most bacteria and many phages have genomes comprised of circular DNA rings. Bacteria and phages do share the need to correctly position their DNA in the bacterial cell; but neither bacteria nor phages are known to possess an equivalent to the spindle apparatus that could perform this positioning. A group of bacteriophages were recently found to contain a type of tubulin called PhuZ; however, it was not known if this protein could form a spindle-like apparatus in bacterial cells. Erb, Kraemer et al. now reveal that PhuZ filaments grow and shorten in similar ways to the microtubules in animal and plant cells: PhuZ proteins are rapidly added to or subtracted from just one end of the fiber. Erb, Kraemer et al. believe this is the first time dynamic instability has been confirmed in a tubulin from a cell without a nucleus. Erb, Kraemer et al. infected bacteria with bacteriophages that use PhuZ and observed that long fibers of PhuZ form and arrange into a structure that resembles a simple form of the spindle apparatus. These structures only form if a virus has invaded a cell. During the early stages of infection, viral DNA localizes to the cell poles but rearranges at around the same time that PhuZ fibers form. At this point, the viral DNA moves towards the middle of the bacterial cell with fibers on either side of the DNA, suggesting that the fibers play a role in moving the DNA. While the fast growing ends of the fibers were shown to be highly dynamic, the other ends were stably anchored at the cell poles. Erb, Kraemer et al. propose that this bacteriophage system may be an evolutionary ancestor of the spindle apparatus, although more work is required to confirm this ."}

We describe a tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence ( t-CyCIF ) method for highly multiplexed immuno-fluorescence imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) specimens mounted on glass slides, the most widely used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. t-CyCIF generates up to 60-plex images using an iterative process ( a cycle ) in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high-dimensional representation. t-CyCIF requires no specialized instruments or reagents and is compatible with super-resolution imaging; we demonstrate its application to quantifying signal transduction cascades, tumor antigens and immune markers in diverse tissues and tumors. The simplicity and adaptability of t-CyCIF makes it an effective method for pre-clinical and clinical research and a natural complement to single-cell genomics.  Histopathology is among the most important and widely used methods for diagnosing human disease and studying the development of multicellular organisms. As commonly performed, imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissue has relatively low dimensionality, primarily comprising Hematoxylin and Eosin ( H&E ) staining supplemented by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ). The potential of IHC to aid in diagnosis and prioritization of therapy is well established ( Bodenmiller, 2016 ), but IHC is primarily a single-channel method: imaging multiple antigens usually involves the analysis of sequential tissue slices or harsh stripping protocols ( although limited multiplexing is possible using IHC and bright-field imaging [Stack et al., 2014; Tsujikawa et al., 2017] ). Antibody detection via formation of a brown diamino-benzidine ( DAB ) or similar precipitates are also less quantitative than fluorescence ( Rimm, 2006 ). The limitations of IHC are particularly acute when it is necessary to quantify complex cellular states and multiple cell types, such as tumor infiltrating regulatory and cytotoxic T cells ( Postow et al., 2015 ) in parallel with tissue and pharmaco-dynamic markers. Advances in DNA and RNA profiling have dramatically improved our understanding of oncogenesis and propelled the development of targeted anticancer drugs ( Garraway and Lander, 2013 ). Sequence data are particularly useful when an oncogenic driver is both a drug target and a biomarker of drug response, such as BRAFV600E in melanoma ( Chapman et al., 2011 ) or BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia ( Druker and Lydon, 2000 ). However, in the case of drugs that act through cell non-autonomous mechanisms, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, tumor-drug interaction must be studied in the context of multicellular environments that include both cancer and non-malignant stromal and infiltrating immune cells. Multiple studies have established that these components of the tumor microenvironment strongly influence the initiation, progression and metastasis of cancer ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011 ) and the magnitude of responsiveness or resistance to immunotherapies ( Tumeh et al., 2014 ). Single-cell transcriptome profiling provides a means to dissect tumor ecosystems at a molecular level and quantify cell types and states ( Tirosh et al., 2016 ). However, single-cell sequencing usually requires disaggregation of tissues, resulting in loss of spatial context ( Tirosh et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2014 ). As a consequence, a variety of multiplexed approaches to analyzing tissues have recently been developed with the goal of simultaneously assaying cell identity, state, and morphology ( Giesen et al., 2014; Gerdes et al., 2013; Micheva and Smith, 2007; Remark et al., 2016; Gerner et al., 2012 ). For example, FISSEQ ( Lee et al., 2014 ) enables genome-scale RNA profiling of tissues at single-cell resolution, and multiplexed ion beam imaging ( MIBI ) and imaging mass cytometry achieve a high degree of multiplexing using antibodies as reagents, metals as labels and mass spectrometry as a detection modality ( Giesen et al., 2014; Angelo et al., 2014 ). Despite the potential of these new methods, they require specialized instrumentation and consumables, which is one reason that the great majority of basic and clinical studies still rely on H&E and\u00a0single-channel IHC staining. Moreover, methods that involve laser ablation of samples such as MIBI inherently have a lower resolution than optical imaging. Thus, there remains a need for highly multiplexed tissue analysis methods that ( i ) minimize the requirement for specialized instruments and costly, proprietary reagents, ( ii ) work with conventionally prepared FFPE tissue specimens collected in clinical practice and research settings, ( iii ) enable imaging of ca. 50 antigens at subcellular resolution across a wide range of cell and tumor types, ( iv ) collect data with sufficient throughput that large specimens ( several square centimeters ) can be imaged and analyzed, ( v ) generate high-resolution data typical of optical microscopy, and ( vi ) allow investigators to customize the antibody mix to specific questions or tissue types. Among these requirements the last is particularly critical: at the current early stage of development of high dimensional histology, it is essential that individual research groups be able to test the widest possible range of antibodies and antigens in search of those with the greatest scientific and diagnostic value. This paper describes a method for highly multiplexed fluorescence imaging of tissues, tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence ( t-CyCIF ), inspired by a cyclic method first described by Gerdes et al. ( 2013 ). t-CyCIF also extends a method we previously described for imaging cells grown in culture ( Lin et al., 2015 ). In its current implementation, t-CyCIF assembles up to 60-plex images of FFPE tissue sections via successive rounds of four-channel imaging. t-CyCIF uses widely available reagents, conventional slide scanners and microscopes, manual or automated slide processing and simple protocols. It can, therefore, be implemented in most research or clinical laboratories on existing equipment. Our data suggest that high-dimensional imaging methods using cyclic immunofluorescence have the potential to become a robust and widely-used complement to single-cell genomics, enabling routine analysis of tissue and cancer morphology and phenotypes at single-cell resolution.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: To diagnose a disease such as cancer, doctors sometimes take small tissue samples called biopsies from the affected area. These biopsies are then thinly sliced and treated with dyes to identify healthy and cancerous cells. However, clinicians and scientists often need to look into what happens inside individual cells in the tissues so they can understand how cancers arise and progress. This helps them to identify different types of tumor cells and to tailor the best treatment for the patient. To do so, a number of proteins ( the molecules involved in nearly all life\u2019s processes ) need to be tracked in healthy and diseased cells and tissues. This can be done thanks to a range of methods known as immunofluorescence microscopy, but following different proteins on the same slice of a sample is difficult. However, a new type of immunofluorescence known as t-CyCIF may be a solution. With this technique, a fluorescent compound is applied that will bind to a specific protein of interest. A microscope can pick up the light from the compound when the sample is imaged, which reveals the protein\u2019s location in the cell or tissue. Then, a substance is used that deactivates the fluorescence signal. After this, another compound that binds to a new type of protein is used, and imaged. This cycle is repeated several times to locate different proteins. Lastly, the individual images are processed and stitched together to reveal the cells and their internal structures. Here, Lin, Izar et al. showed that t-CyCIF could be used to study biopsies and to obtain images that covered a large area of healthy human tissues and tumors. The technique helped to track over 60 different proteins in normal and tumor tissue samples from human patients. Several sets of experiments showed that t-CyCIF could uncover the molecular mechanisms that are disrupted during cancer, but also reveal the complexity of a single tumor. In fact, as shown with biopsies of brain cancer, cancerous cells in a tumor can be strikingly different, even when they are close to each other. Finally, the method helped to pinpoint which types of immune cells are involved in fighting a kidney tumor. Overall, such information cannot be obtained with conventional methods, yet is crucial for diagnosis and treatment. Most laboratories can readily use t-CyCIF since the technique is open source and requires equipment that is easily accessible. In fact, the technique should soon be used to assess how well certain drugs help the immune system combat cancer. Ultimately, better use of biopsies is key to customizing cancer care ."}

Although linked to several pathways including cell survival and metabolism, the molecular mechanisms underlying these outcomes are poorly understood. We identified a novel interaction of DPP9 with Filamin A, which recruits DPP9 to Syk, a central kinase in B-cell signalling. Syk signalling can be terminated by degradation, requiring the ubiquitin E3 ligase Cbl. We show that DPP9 cleaves Syk to produce a neo N-terminus with serine in position 1. Pulse-chases combined with mutagenesis studies reveal that Ser1 strongly influences Syk stability. Furthermore, DPP9 silencing reduces Cbl interaction with Syk, suggesting that DPP9 processing is a prerequisite for Syk ubiquitination. Consistently, DPP9 inhibition stabilizes Syk, thereby modulating Syk signalling. Taken together, we demonstrate DPP9 as a negative regulator of Syk and conclude that DPP9 is a novel integral aminopeptidase of the N-end rule pathway.  Proteases of the DPPIV family are serine aminopeptidases that remove a dipeptide from the N-terminus of substrates having a Pro or an Ala residue in the second position ( NH2-XaaPro or NH2-XaaAla ) ( Yu et al., 2010; Waumans et al., 2015 ). DPP8 and DPP9 are the only known intracellular members of this family, sharing 60% homology with a higher conservation ( >90% identity ) in their active site ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). Not surprisingly, DPP8 and DPP9 are similar in their biochemical properties ( Geiss-Friedlander et al., 2009; Connolly et al., 2008 ). However, DPP9, but not DPP8, is rate-limiting for the hydrolysis of proline-containing peptides in the cytoplasm, and plays a role in maturation of antigenic peptides for presentation on MHC class I alleles ( Geiss-Friedlander et al., 2009 ). Knock-in mice expressing an inactive variant of DPP9 die 8\u201324\u2009hr after birth, demonstrating its importance for neonatal survival which is not compensated by DPP8 ( Gall et al., 2013 ). DPP9 shows a broad tissue distribution ( Qi et al., 2003; Ajami et al., 2004 ), localizes to the cytosol ( Ajami et al., 2004 ), nucleus ( Justa-Schuch et al., 2014 ), and to the leading edge of migrating cells ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). DPP9 is linked to several pathways including Akt signalling ( Yao et al., 2011; Pilla et al., 2013 ), activation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages ( Matheeussen et al., 2013 ), cell migration ( Zhang et al., 2015 ) and apoptosis of specific cell lines ( Matheeussen et al., 2013; Spagnuolo et al., 2013 ). The molecular mechanisms leading to these different outcomes are poorly understood. For a profounder understanding of its molecular functions, we screened for interacting partners of DPP9, reasoning that these will include substrates and regulators of this peptidase. Previously, we identified SUMO1 as a novel DPP9 associating protein, and demonstrated that SUMO1 acts as an allosteric activator of DPP9 ( Pilla et al., 2013, 2012 ). Now we report filamin A ( FLNA ) as a novel interacting partner of DPP9, which we identified in a yeast two-hybrid assay. FLNA is an actin binding protein that cross-links actin filaments into orthogonal networks, and is important for cell stiffening, cell adhesion and cell migration ( Nakamura et al., 2011 ). An actin-binding domain is located at the amino terminus of FLNA, followed by 24 Ig-like repeats. Repeat 24 is involved in FLNA dimerization, whereas the other repeats are important for the rod-like structure of FLNA ( Figure 1A ) ( Nakamura et al., 2007 ), and participate in numerous interactions with membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins ( Zhou et al., 2010 ). Consequently, FLNA influences several cellular signalling events. Most proteins identified so far bind preferentially to FLNA repeats 16\u201324 ( Yue et al., 2013 ). Surprisingly, we mapped the interaction between DPP9 and FLNA to repeats 5\u20137. Apart from DPP9, so far only the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk is known to bind to FLNA repeat 5 ( Falet et al., 2010 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 16370. 003Figure 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 16370. 004 Although it is also\u00a0expressed in non-haematopoietic cells, Syk is best characterized as an essential component in B cell receptor ( BCR ) mediated signalling. Syk is activated upon BCR engagement, and consequently initiates a cascade of events by phosphorylating its downstream effectors ( M\u00f3csai et al., 2010; Geahlen, 2009 ). The interaction between FLNA and Syk was identified in platelets, where loss of FLNA resulted in reduced signalling and mislocalization of Syk ( Falet et al., 2010 ). Here we show that DPP9 forms a complex with\u00a0FLNA and Syk. In this complex FLNA acts as a recruiting factor linking DPP9 to Syk, resulting in cleavage of the Syk N-terminus by DPP9, thus affecting Syk stability and Syk dependent signal transduction.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Proteins are made up of building blocks called amino acids bonded together to form chain-like molecules. Around twenty different amino acids are used to make proteins, and enzymes called proteases can recognize specific pairs of amino acids in proteins and cut the bonds between them. Dipeptidylpeptidase 9 ( or DPP9 for short ) is a protease that removes two amino acids from the end of a protein, just as long the second amino acid is one of two specific kinds ( namely, an alanine or a proline ). The DPP9 protease influences a range of processes in the cell including cell death, signaling and survival. Indeed, mice born with an inactive version of DPP9 die shortly after birth, but it is not known why this happens. Justa-Schuch et al. investigated how the protease DPP9 controls processes inside cells and found an unexpected connection between DPP9 and another protein called Syk. The Syk protein is found in immune cells called B cells, and becomes highly activated whenever these cells are stimulated. Once activated Syk changes the activity of many proteins, affecting which genes are switched on and how the B cell moves and divides. By using DPP9 as a kind of bait, Justa-Schuch et al. found human proteins that bind to the protease. This search identified a protein called Filamin A that interacted with DPP9, placing DPP9 close to Syk, which also binds to Filamin A. Further experiments showed that when DPP9 was located close to Syk, it cut the end of Syk. This cut left the Syk protein with a different amino acid exposed at its end, which in turn made it susceptible to being broken down inside the cell. Justa-Schuch et al. went on to show that DPP9 preferentially cleaved the active form of Syk. Since cleaved Syk was subsequently broken down, DPP9 acts as a shut-off mechanism for Syk after the B cell has been stimulated. The findings show that DPP9 can influence how much and how long the B cell responds to stimulation. Inhibitors of DPP9 may therefore be useful for stabilizing Syk, which is known to stop specific tumors from growing. Future work will investigate the mechanisms that control how Filamin A, DPP9 and Syk interact ."}
{"text": "[INST] <<SYS>>\nWrite a lay summary of this biomedical article. Do not make up information.\n<</SYS>>\n\nArticle:\nMany bacteria communicate with kin and coordinate group behaviors through a form of cell-cell signaling called acyl-homoserine lactone ( AHL ) quorum sensing ( QS ). In these systems, a signal synthase produces an AHL to which its paired receptor selectively responds. Selectivity is fundamental to cell signaling. Despite its importance, it has been challenging to determine how this selectivity is achieved and how AHL QS systems evolve and diversify. We hypothesized that we could use covariation within the protein sequences of AHL synthases and receptors to identify selectivity residues. We began by identifying about 6000 unique synthase-receptor pairs. We then used the protein sequences of these pairs to identify covariation patterns and mapped the patterns onto the LasI/R system from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The covarying residues in both proteins cluster around the ligand-binding sites. We demonstrate that these residues are involved in system selectivity toward the cognate signal and go on to engineer the Las system to both produce and respond to an alternate AHL signal. We have thus demonstrated that covariation methods provide a powerful approach for investigating selectivity in protein-small molecule interactions and have deepened our understanding of how communication systems evolve and diversify.  Quorum sensing ( QS ) is a widespread form of cell-cell signaling that bacteria use to coordinate the production of public goods including toxins, antibiotics, bioluminescence, and secreted enzymes ( Waters and Bassler, 2005; Whiteley et al., 2017 ). Many Proteobacteria ( Case et al., 2008 ) and Nitrospirae ( Mellbye et al., 2017 ) employ a form of QS based on acyl-homoserine lactone ( AHL ) signals. AHL QS systems consist of two proteins: a LuxI-type signal synthase and a LuxR-type receptor ( Figure 1A ). The signal synthase produces an AHL from S-adenosyl\u00a0methionine ( SAM ) and an acyl-acyl carrier protein for some LuxI-type synthases or an acyl-coenzyme A substrate for others ( Schaefer et al., 2008;\u00a0Figure 1B ). AHL signals can freely diffuse through cell membranes ( Kaplan and Greenberg, 1985; Pearson et al., 1999 ) and at low cell density the QS system is \u2018off\u2019. At high cell density, the signal accumulates and binds the LuxR-type receptor which is a cytosolic transcription factor that regulates gene expression in response to signal binding. AHL signals share a conserved lactone core, but vary in the acyl moiety which can be a fatty acid ranging from 4 to 20 carbons long, with potential oxidation on the C3 carbon and varying degrees of unsaturation, or can have an aromatic or branched structure ( Rajput et al., 2016 ). This variability in the acyl portion of the signal confers selectivity to the system. Typically, a LuxI-type synthase produces a primary AHL to which its paired LuxR-type receptor selectively responds ( Aframian and Eldar, 2020 ). Selectivity is critical to cell signaling in order to avoid undesired cross-talk or spurious outputs ( Laub, 2016 ). In the case of QS, selectivity ensures bacteria cooperate only with kin cells. Despite its importance, we know little about how QS systems achieve selectivity or how they evolve and diversify to use new signals. Although the conserved amino acids essential for synthase and receptor activity are well described ( Parsek et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2002 ), residues that dictate selectivity are often different from those that are required for activity ( Collins et al., 2005 ). Due to the low amino acid sequence identity between LuxI/R homologues, it has been difficult to determine how QS systems discriminate between various AHL signals ( Fuqua et al., 1996 ). We hypothesized that we could use covariation patterns to identify QS selectivity residues. Such methods have been used to identify amino acid residues that interact with each other within proteins and between proteins that physically bind one another ( Aakre et al., 2015; Ovchinnikov et al., 2014; Skerker et al., 2008 ). Here, we endeavored to expand these methods to assess the interaction between AHL synthases and receptors. While AHL synthases and receptors do not physically interact, they interact indirectly via binding to a shared cognate signal and are believed to coevolve to maintain this shared signal recognition ( Aframian and Eldar, 2020 ). Phylogenetic analyses also support coevolution of synthases and receptors ( Gray and Garey, 2001; Lerat and Moran, 2004 ). We therefore hypothesized that we could apply covariation methods in a novel way to identify amino acid residues that covary between QS synthases and receptors, and further, that the covarying residues would be those responsible for signal selectivity. We used a statistical method, GREMLIN ( Kamisetty et al., 2013 ), to measure covariation within the sequences of AHL synthase-receptor pairs and mapped the covarying residues onto the LasI/R QS system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. By engineering substitutions in the top-scoring residues identified by GREMLIN, we demonstrate that they are indeed important for signal selectivity and, further, that these residues can be used to rationally engineer LasI/R to produce and respond to a non-native signal. We thus provide a proof of principle for a new use of covariation methods to investigate selectivity in non-physical protein-protein interactions and at the same time identify determinants of QS signal selectivity.  [/INST]\n\nLay Summary: Communication is vital in any community and it is no different for bacteria. Some of the microbes living in bacterial communities are closely related to one another and can help each other survive and grow. They do this by releasing chemical signals that coordinate their behaviors, including those that are damaging to the infected host. A key aspect of this coordination is knowing how many related bacteria are present in a given environment. In a process known as quorum sensing, the bacteria release a chemical signal which neighboring sibling bacteria detect and respond to. The larger the population of bacteria, the more the signal accumulates. At a certain threshold, the signal activates the genes needed to trigger a coordinated action, such as producing toxins or antibiotics. Many bacteria communicate using acylhomoserine lactone signaling systems, which involve different signals depending on the species of bacteria. But it is unclear how this diversity evolved, and how bacteria can distinguish between signals from related and unrelated bacterial cells. To understand this, Wellington Miranda et al. used computational techniques to analyze how the proteins responsible for acylhomoserine lactone signaling coevolved. The analysis identified specific parts of these proteins that determine which signal will be produced and which will trigger a bacterium into action. Wellington Miranda et al. then used these insights to engineer the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa to produce and respond to a signal that is naturally made by another bacterial species. These computational methods could be used to analyze other proteins that have coevolved but do not physically interact. Within the area of quorum sensing, this approach will help to better understand the costs and benefits of signal selectivity. This may help to predict bacterial interactions and therefore behaviors during infections ."}
